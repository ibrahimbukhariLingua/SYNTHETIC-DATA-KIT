[S14] 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of Natural Language Processing\n(NLP) tasks, especially in Question Answering (QA) [20, 22, 38, 39]. [S15] Despite the advancements,\nthe issue of hallucination persists as a significant challenge; LLMs may generate answers that lack\nfactual accuracy or grounding [14,27,30,32]. [S16] Studies have shown that GPT-4\u2019s accuracy in answering\nquestions referring to slow-changing or fast-changing facts is below 15% [36]; even for stable (never-\nchanging) facts, GPT-4\u2019s accuracy in answering questions referring to torso-to-tail (less popular)\nentities is below 35% [29]. [S17] Overcoming hallucinations thus becomes a priority in building reliable\nQA systems [13, 14]. [S18] Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [6, 8, 12, 19] has recently emerged as a promising solution to\nalleviate LLM\u2019s deficiency in lack of knowledge and attracted a lot of attention from both academia\nresearch and industry. [S19] Given a question, a RAG system searches external sources to retrieve relevant\ninformation and then provides grounded answers [7, 12, 19] (see Figure 1 for an illustration).

[S191] First, the best LLM-only solutions (GPT-4 Turbo)\nobtained an accuracy of only 34%, with truthfulness of 20%, showing a big room for improvement. [S192] Second, straightforward RAG solutions obtained up to 44% accuracy, showing that extra information\ndoes help answer more questions reliably. [S193] Interestingly, none of the RAG solutions obtain truthfulness\nhigher than 20%; this is because all RAG solutions introduce more hallucinations generated from\nirrelevant retrieval results, showing a big challenge in RAG\u2014How to judiciously use retrieval results\nwithout being distracted by retrieval noises? [S194] Third, we found that Task 2 truthfulness scores are\nhigher than Task 1, showing that the KG knowledge helps improve accuracy, with a similar or even\nlower hallucination rate, because the KG knowledge is typically brief but precise. [S195] Unfortunately, the\nimprovement is mediocre, showing a second challenge in RAG\u2014How to best leverage the power of\nKG data? [S196] Finally, the truthfulness for Task 3 are also higher than Task 2, because of better search\nranking (recall that Task 1 and 2 provide five pages randomly selected from the top-10 search results)\nand better search recall. [S197] In particular, we found that the ground truths of over 30% of questions are\navailable in the web retrieval results but are not included in the prompt due to the context window\nlimitation. [S198] This shows the importance of search ranking in RAG. [S199] Figure 3 shows the auto-eval results across the domain, dynamism, popularity, and question type\ndimension.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the significance of the CRAG benchmark in advancing RAG research and the resources provided to support its use.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context given. The passage starts with the abstract of the CRAG benchmark. From the sentences provided, I see that CRAG is introduced as a comprehensive benchmark with 4,409 question-answer pairs and mock APIs to simulate web and KG search. It's designed to cover diverse domains and question categories, which suggests it's significant because it addresses the limitations of existing datasets that don't represent real-world QA tasks well. \n\nLooking at the citations, sentence S5 mentions that existing datasets don't adequately represent real-world QA tasks, so CRAG bridges this gap. Then S6 talks about CRAG's design with diverse questions across domains and categories. The evaluation results in S8 and S9 show that even with RAG, there's a gap in accuracy, which highlights the benchmark's role in identifying challenges. Also, S11 points out that CRAG reveals lower accuracy in dynamic or complex facts, suggesting future research directions. \n\nThe significance here is that CRAG provides a more realistic and comprehensive testbed for RAG systems, exposing their limitations and guiding future research. The resources mentioned include the benchmark itself, the website (S14), and the KDD Cup 2024 challenge (S12). Also, the availability of the benchmark on GitHub is a key resource.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. For the significance, S5, S6, S8, S9, S11, and S12 are relevant. For the resources, S12 (KDD Cup), S14 (GitHub link), and maybe S13 (commitment to maintain it). \n\nWait, the user also asks about resources provided. The passage mentions the KDD Cup 2024 challenge (S12), the availability on GitHub (S14), and the commitment to maintain it (S13). Also, the mock APIs and the dataset itself are resources. \n\nSo structuring the answer: first, the significance is that CRAG addresses the gap in existing datasets by providing a diverse and dynamic benchmark, evaluates RAG systems, highlights challenges, and guides future research. Then the resources are the benchmark dataset, mock APIs, GitHub availability, KDD Cup challenge, and ongoing maintenance."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking two things: first, how the second passage defines 'minor hallucination,' and second, which paper from the first passage might require careful handling of such issues during evaluation.\n\nStarting with the first part, I need to look through Passage 2 to find the definition of 'minor hallucination.' Scanning through the text, I see entries S834 to S843. Specifically, S839 states: \"\u2018Minor hallucination\u2019 means the answer addressed the user\u2019s question but might be off on some additional details.\" That seems to be the direct definition. Also, S838 mentions that the answer may contain some minor hallucination that doesn't significantly alter the overall meaning, which supports the definition.\n\nNow, for the second part, I need to find a paper in Passage 1 that deals with hallucinations in large language models, as those would require careful handling. Looking at Passage 1, there are several references. For example, [S373] is a survey on hallucination in large language models. Another one is [S388] which is a survey on hallucination in natural language generation. Also, [S374] is a paper titled \"A survey on hallucination in large language models: Principles, taxonomy, challenges, and open questions.\" These all seem relevant. The question is which one from the first passage might require careful handling. Since the second passage discusses minor hallucinations, the paper that's a survey on hallucinations in LLMs would be the one that needs careful handling during evaluation. So, [S373] or [S374] are likely candidates. Checking the exact citations, [S373] is the survey mentioned, so that's the one."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the primary purpose of the CRAG benchmark and the future improvements planned for it, based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context given. The passage mentions CRAG in several sentences. Let me scan through each sentence to find relevant information.\n\nLooking at the first passage, sentence S231 says: \"This paper proposes CRAG, a rich and comprehensive benchmark designed to advance research in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\" That seems to directly answer the primary purpose. So the purpose is to advance RAG research.\n\nThen, sentence S232 mentions that CRAG reviewed gaps in existing RAG solutions and provided insights for future improvement. But the user is asking about future improvements, so maybe that's part of it. However, the specific future improvements are mentioned in S233: \"We plan to continue improving and expanding the benchmark for multi-lingual questions, multi-modal questions, multi-turn conversations, etc., to ensure CRAG stays at the forefront to push RAG research, adapts to emerging challenges, and evolves for new research needs.\" So the future improvements include multi-lingual, multi-modal, and multi-turn conversations.\n\nI need to make sure there's no other information in other parts of the context. The rest of the passages talk about test data splits, experiments, and results, which don't seem relevant to the purpose or future improvements. The references and other sections are about acknowledgments and citations, which aren't needed here.\n\nSo the answer should state that the primary purpose is to advance RAG research, and the future improvements include expanding to multi-lingual, multi-modal, and multi-turn conversations. The citations would be S231 for the purpose and S233 for the improvements. I need to structure the response with each statement and their citations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how the data was split for the CRAG benchmark and the roles of the validation, public test, and private test sets in the evaluation process.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information. The user mentioned Passage 1 and Passage 2. Let me check both.\n\nLooking at Passage 2, there's a section starting with \"[S176] We split the data randomly into validation (30%), public test (30%), and private (40%), and released the validation and public test sets (Appendix A.2.3).\" That seems to answer the first part about the data split. So the split is 30% validation, 30% public test, and 40% private.\n\nNext, the roles. The same passage continues: \"[S177] Participants of the KDD Cup challenge can use the validation and public test sets to develop and test their models, and the submitted solutions were evaluated on the private test set.\" This indicates that the validation and public test sets are used for development and testing by participants, while the private test set is for evaluation.\n\nThen, \"[S178] Future offline users of CRAG can use the validation set for development, fine-tuning, and validation, and the public test set for testing and result reporting.\" So the validation set is for development and fine-tuning, and the public test is for testing and reporting. The private test set's role isn't explicitly detailed beyond being used for evaluation, but from [S177], it's where the final evaluation happens.\n\nI need to make sure there's no other information in the context. Passage 1 doesn't mention the data split, so the answer is in Passage 2. The citations would be [S176], [S177], and [S178]. \n\nNow, structuring the answer with each sentence and the correct citations. The first sentence about the split cites [S176]. The roles of validation and public test sets cite [S177] and [S178], while the private test set's role is covered in [S177]. \n\nWait, the user's question asks for the roles of all three sets. The private test set's role is mentioned in [S177] as being used for evaluation. The validation and public test sets' roles are in [S177] and [S178]. So each part should be split into sentences with appropriate citations."

      "answer": "<statement>The query time is incorporated into the prompts provided to the language models (LLMs) during the RAG evaluation process. Specifically, the prompts include the original \"Query Time\" formatted as \"mm/dd/yyyy, hh:mm:ss PT,\" which the LLM uses to answer questions based on the temporal context of the query. This ensures answers are generated using information available up to that specific time. <cite>[S876][S877][S880][S881][S882]</cite></statement>\n\n<statement>The role of query time in generating answers is to enforce temporal accuracy. By specifying the query time, the system ensures that retrieved results and generated answers align with the data available at that moment. For example, in RAG prompts, the model is instructed to answer based on the query time and the retrieved results, which are also sourced from the same time period. This prevents the use of outdated or future information, critical for tasks like financial or news-related queries. <cite>[S876][S877][S888][S889][S890]</cite></statement>\n\n<statement>Query time also influences evaluation criteria, particularly in human and auto-evaluation metrics. Answers are scored for accuracy based on whether they reflect facts valid at the specified query time.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how query time is handled in the RAG evaluation process and what role it plays in generating answers. They want details synthesized from the prompt structures and evaluation criteria provided in the supporting context.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the given passages to find mentions of query time. Let me scan through Passage 2 first because the user mentioned \"prompt structures\" which might be there. \n\nIn Passage 2, under \"A.3 Evaluating straightforward RAG solutions,\" there's a section that says: \"We send each CRAG question in a prompt shown below. This prompt is designed to include the original Query Time for the question and ask the LLM to answer the question based on the query time and the retrieved result.\" That's a key point. So query time is included in the prompt, and the LLM has to answer based on that time and the retrieved data. The citation here would be [S876] and [S877], maybe [S878] as well?\n\nThen looking at the prompts for Vanilla LLM, RAG with web search, and RAG with KG and web search. Each of these prompts includes the Query Time. For example, the Vanilla LLM prompt says: \"You are given a Question and the time when it was asked in the Pacific Time Zone (PT), referred to as 'Query Time'.\" The format is \"mm/dd/yyyy, hh:mm:ss PT\". So the query time is part of the input to the model. That's handled by including it in the prompt. \n\nThe role of query time in generating answers is to ensure that the answers are based on the information available up to that specific time. The evaluation criteria mention that the retrieved results are from the same query time, so the model must use that temporal context. For instance, in the prompt, the model is instructed to answer based on the query time and the retrieved results, which are also from that time. This ensures that the answers are temporally accurate, which is crucial for tasks where data changes over time, like financial information or news.\n\nAlso, in the human evaluation section (Passage 1, S799-S801), they score answers based on accuracy, which would include whether the answer is correct given the query time. If the answer uses outdated information, it might be marked as incorrect. \n\nAnother point is the auto-evaluation mentioned in Passage 2, where Stage 1 uses auto-eval, and Stage 2 uses manual evaluation. The prompts for RAG solutions include the query time, which is part of the evaluation criteria. The query time's role is to test the system's ability to handle time-sensitive data, ensuring that the answers are not only factually correct but also timely.\n\nSo, putting this together: Query time is incorporated into the prompts given to the LLMs, specifying the exact time the query was made. The models must generate answers based on this time, using retrieved data from that same period. This ensures temporal accuracy, which is part of the evaluation criteria, affecting the truthfulness score and the accuracy grading. The citations would be from the parts where the prompts are described, like [S876], [S877], [S880]-[S883], [S888]-[S892], etc."

        "[S870] The KDD Cup 2024 Meta CRAG challenge has two stages. [S871] Stage 1 is designed for the participants to\ndevelop their RAG solutions by submitting their systems against the leaderboard, whereas Stage 2\ndetermines the final winners. [S872] We split our benchmark data into three sets with similar distributions:\nvalidation, public test, and private test at 30%, 30%, and 40%, respectively.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the purpose of the Query entity extraction prompt and what structured information it extracts. They also want me to synthesize details from the entity extraction instructions and domain classification.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions several sections, but I should focus on where the Query entity extraction is discussed. Scanning through, I see Passage 2 has a section titled \"Query entity extraction\" with a prompt starting at [S906]. \n\nLooking at that section, the prompt says the agent should output JSON and perform two tasks: determine the domain of the query and extract structured information. The domains listed are finance, sports, music, movie, encyclopedia, or other. For the structured information, the rules mention including different keys in the JSON based on the domain. For 'encyclopedia' and 'other', the key is 'main_entity'. However, the context cuts off, so I might not have the full details for other domains.\n\nThe purpose of the Query entity extraction prompt seems to be categorizing the query into a domain and extracting relevant entities. The structured information likely includes the main entity for certain domains. Since the example given is 'main_entity' for 'encyclopedia' and 'other', but other domains might have different keys. However, the context provided doesn't specify those, so I can only mention what's there.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The relevant parts are in Passage 2, specifically [S906] to [S914]. The exact sentences about the domain classification are in [S909]-[S911], and the structured info in [S913]-[S914]. Also, the instruction to output JSON is in [S906]-[S908].\n\nSo, the answer should state that the purpose is to determine the domain and extract structured info, with the domain being one of the listed categories and the structured info including 'main_entity' for certain domains. The citations would be the relevant sentences in Passage 2."

      "chunk": "Passage 1:\n[S145] Mock KGs. [S146] We created mock KGs that contain publicly available KG data used to generate the\nquestions, randomly selected entities of the same type, and also \u201chard negative\u201d entities with similar\nnames (e.g., \u201cphantom\u201d for \u201cphantom of the opera\u201d). [S147] Mock APIs. [S148] We created mock APIs with pre-defined parameters to support structured search in the\nmock KGs. [S149] For example, for queries asking for stock prices, an example mock API is in the form of\nget_price_history(ticker). [S150] We collected snapshots of the KG and web search data concurrently while posing real-time and\nfast-changing questions. [S151] This approach ensures that we capture the \u201csnapshot\u201d of the information\nworld at the time of question answering. [S152] A RAG solution that performs well on the benchmark should\nalso be capable of reasoning over time and generalizing to evolving questions. [S153] In total, the resulting data contains 220K webpages, a KG of 2.6M entities, and 38 mock APIs. [S154] See\nTable 9 in the Appendix for a complete list of the mock APIs. [S155] 4 Metrics and Evaluation\n\nIn this section, we present the metrics for evaluating the RAG systems and briefly describe the 2024\nMeta KDD Cup challenge in Appendix A.2.3. [S156] 4.1 Metrics\n\nWe use a scoring method to assess the performance of RAG systems. [S157] For each question in the\nevaluation set, we first label the answer with perfect, acceptable, missing, or incorrect, according to\nthe following criteria. [S158] Perfect. [S159] The response correctly answers the user\u2019s question and contains no hallucinated content. [S160] 6\n\n05101520253035404550Number of retrieved web pages0102030405060708090100Estimated recall (%)45.152.856.157.659.560.861.862.863.564.469.476.279.080.181.182.282.983.683.984.6Page snippets+ Full pages\fAcceptable. [S161] The response provides a useful answer to the user\u2019s question but may contain minor\nerrors that do not harm the usefulness of the answer. [S162] Missing. [S163] The response is \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t find ...\u201d, a system error such as an empty\nresponse, or a request from the system to clarify the original question. [S164] Incorrect. [S165] The response provides wrong or irrelevant information to answer the user\u2019s question. [S166] We use a scoring method with score 1, 0.5, 0, and \u00b41 for each perfect, acceptable, missing, and\nincorrect answer, respectively, where we penalize hallucinated answers and prefer missing answers to\nincorrect ones. [S167] We then define truthfulness as the average score from all examples in the evaluation\nset for a given RAG system. [S168] 4.2 Evaluation\n\nSimilar to previous work [37], we employ both human evaluation (human-eval) and model-based\nautomatic evaluation (auto-eval). [S169] In the former, we use manual grading to judge perfect, acceptable,\nmissing, and incorrect for each answer. [S170] In the latter, we merge perfect and acceptable, call it accurate,\nand use a three-way scoring system with 1, \u00b41, 0 for accurate, incorrect, and missing answers. [S171] We design a two-step method for automatic evaluation: if the answer matches the ground truth exactly,\nit is considered accurate; otherwise, we use LLMs to determine whether the response is accurate,\nincorrect, or missing. [S172] To avoid the self-preference problem [25], we use two LLM evaluators:\nChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-0125) [24] and Llama 3 (llama-3-70B-instruct) [2] and report the\naverage accurate, hallucination, missing rates, and truthfulness scores from the two models for each\nRAG system. [S173] Our offline experiment shows that this two-step method yields an average F1 score of\n94.7% for ChatGPT and 98.9% for Llama 3 compared to human-eval.

[S147] Mock APIs. [S148] We created mock APIs with pre-defined parameters to support structured search in the\nmock KGs.

[S161] The response provides a useful answer to the user\u2019s question but may contain minor\nerrors that do not harm the usefulness of the answer. [S162] Missing.

[S164] Incorrect. [S165] The response provides wrong or irrelevant information to answer the user\u2019s question. [S166] We use a scoring method with score 1, 0.5, 0, and \u00b41 for each perfect, acceptable, missing, and\nincorrect answer, respectively, where we penalize hallucinated answers and prefer missing answers to\nincorrect ones. [S167] We then define truthfulness as the average score from all examples in the evaluation\nset for a given RAG system. [S168] 4.2 Evaluation\n\nSimilar to previous work [37], we employ both human evaluation (human-eval) and model-based\nautomatic evaluation (auto-eval). [S169] In the former, we use manual grading to judge perfect, acceptable,\nmissing, and incorrect for each answer. [S170] In the latter, we merge perfect and acceptable, call it accurate,\nand use a three-way scoring system with 1, \u00b41, 0 for accurate, incorrect, and missing answers. [S171] We design a two-step method for automatic evaluation: if the answer matches the ground truth exactly,\nit is considered accurate; otherwise, we use LLMs to determine whether the response is accurate,\nincorrect, or missing. [S172] To avoid the self-preference problem [25], we use two LLM evaluators:\nChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-0125) [24] and Llama 3 (llama-3-70B-instruct) [2] and report the\naverage accurate, hallucination, missing rates, and truthfulness scores from the two models for each\nRAG system. [S173] Our offline experiment shows that this two-step method yields an average F1 score of\n94.7% for ChatGPT and 98.9% for Llama 3 compared to human-eval.

The user is asking about the two-step automatic evaluation method for RAG systems and the role of LLM evaluators like ChatGPT and Llama 3.\n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant parts in the provided passages. Looking through the context, I remember that Passage 1 has a section about evaluation. Let me check there.\n\nIn Passage 1, under \"4.2 Evaluation\", there's a mention of a two-step method. The key sentences are [S171] and [S172]. Sentence [S171] says: \"We design a two-step method for automatic evaluation: if the answer matches the ground truth exactly, it is considered accurate; otherwise, we use LLMs to determine whether the response is accurate, incorrect, or missing.\" That explains the two steps. Then [S172] mentions using two LLM evaluators, ChatGPT and Llama 3, to avoid self-preference issues. \n\nSo the two-step method first checks exact matches, and if not, uses LLMs. The LLMs evaluate the answers when there's no exact match. The citations would be [S171] and [S172]. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other information. The rest of the passage talks about F1 scores and other details, but the core explanation is in those two sentences. The answer should combine these points, citing those sentences."

[S705] Then we created question-answer\npairs in three steps for Simple static and dynamic questions. [S706] Step 1. [S707] For each domain, we first selected an entity type and a meaningful relation pe, rq and created\na question template. [S708] For example, for (music artist, first album), we create a template \u201cwhat is the\nfirst album of [music artist]?\u201d. [S709] Step 2. [S710] We then sampled entities from the KGs to fill in the templates and generate the full question. [S711] We adopted the method described in [29] and sampled entities of top, middle, and bottom popularity. [S712] We defined popularity based on heuristics for each entity type and created an equal number of\nquestions for each bucket. [S713] Step 3. [S714] Last, we took the associated attribute values as the answer to the question to create question-\nanswer pairs.",
      "chunk_list": [
        "[S145] Mock KGs. [S146] We created mock KGs that contain publicly available KG data used to generate the\nquestions, randomly selected entities of the same type, and also \u201chard negative\u201d entities with similar\nnames (e.g., \u201cphantom\u201d for \u201cphantom of the opera\u201d). [S147] Mock APIs. [S148] We created mock APIs with pre-defined parameters to support structured search in the\nmock KGs. [S149] For example, for queries asking for stock prices, an example mock API is in the form of\nget_price_history(ticker). [S150] We collected snapshots of the KG and web search data concurrently while posing real-time and\nfast-changing questions. [S151] This approach ensures that we capture the \u201csnapshot\u201d of the information\nworld at the time of question answering. [S152] A RAG solution that performs well on the benchmark should\nalso be capable of reasoning over time and generalizing to evolving questions. [S153] In total, the resulting data contains 220K webpages, a KG of 2.6M entities, and 38 mock APIs. [S154] See\nTable 9 in the Appendix for a complete list of the mock APIs. [S155] 4 Metrics and Evaluation\n\nIn this section, we present the metrics for evaluating the RAG systems and briefly describe the 2024\nMeta KDD Cup challenge in Appendix A.2.3. [S156] 4.1 Metrics\n\nWe use a scoring method to assess the performance of RAG systems. [S157] For each question in the\nevaluation set, we first label the answer with perfect, acceptable, missing, or incorrect, according to\nthe following criteria. [S158] Perfect. [S159] The response correctly answers the user\u2019s question and contains no hallucinated content. [S160] 6\n\n05101520253035404550Number of retrieved web pages0102030405060708090100Estimated recall (%)45.152.856.157.659.560.861.862.863.564.469.476.279.080.181.182.282.983.683.984.6Page snippets+ Full pages\fAcceptable. [S161] The response provides a useful answer to the user\u2019s question but may contain minor\nerrors that do not harm the usefulness of the answer. [S162] Missing. [S163] The response is \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t find ...\u201d, a system error such as an empty\nresponse, or a request from the system to clarify the original question. [S164] Incorrect. [S165] The response provides wrong or irrelevant information to answer the user\u2019s question. [S166] We use a scoring method with score 1, 0.5, 0, and \u00b41 for each perfect, acceptable, missing, and\nincorrect answer, respectively, where we penalize hallucinated answers and prefer missing answers to\nincorrect ones. [S167] We then define truthfulness as the average score from all examples in the evaluation\nset for a given RAG system. [S168] 4.2 Evaluation\n\nSimilar to previous work [37], we employ both human evaluation (human-eval) and model-based\nautomatic evaluation (auto-eval). [S169] In the former, we use manual grading to judge perfect, acceptable,\nmissing, and incorrect for each answer. [S170] In the latter, we merge perfect and acceptable, call it accurate,\nand use a three-way scoring system with 1, \u00b41, 0 for accurate, incorrect, and missing answers. [S171] We design a two-step method for automatic evaluation: if the answer matches the ground truth exactly,\nit is considered accurate; otherwise, we use LLMs to determine whether the response is accurate,\nincorrect, or missing. [S172] To avoid the self-preference problem [25], we use two LLM evaluators:\nChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-0125) [24] and Llama 3 (llama-3-70B-instruct) [2] and report the\naverage accurate, hallucination, missing rates, and truthfulness scores from the two models for each\nRAG system. [S173] Our offline experiment shows that this two-step method yields an average F1 score of\n94.7% for ChatGPT and 98.9% for Llama 3 compared to human-eval. [S174] See Appendix A.2.2 for more\ndetails.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the criteria that define a 'perfect' answer according to the source and how the truthfulness metric for RAG systems accounts for hallucinations and missing answers.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The main passage here is Passage 1, which discusses metrics and evaluation for RAG systems. Let me scan through the sentences in that passage.\n\nLooking at the section starting with \"4 Metrics and Evaluation,\" there's a part about labeling answers. Specifically, sentence [S157] mentions labeling answers as perfect, acceptable, missing, or incorrect. Then, in [S158], it says \"Perfect. The response correctly answers the user\u2019s question and contains no hallucinated content.\" That seems to directly answer the first part about the criteria for a perfect answer. So the criteria are correct answer and no hallucinations.\n\nNext, the user also asks about how the truthfulness metric accounts for hallucinations and missing answers. In the same passage, [S166] states that they use a scoring method with penalties for hallucinated answers and prefer missing over incorrect. Then [S167] defines truthfulness as the average score from all examples. Also, [S168] mentions the evaluation part, but the key point is in [S166] where they penalize hallucinations and prefer missing answers. So the truthfulness metric accounts for this by penalizing hallucinations and considering missing answers as better than incorrect ones.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other relevant sentences. The other parts talk about metrics like F1 scores and evaluation methods, but the specific criteria and truthfulness are covered in [S158] and [S166]. Also, check if there's any mention of missing answers in the truthfulness metric. [S166] does mention preferring missing to incorrect, which affects the scoring. So the truthfulness is calculated based on these scores, which take into account the penalties and preferences.\n\nSo the answer should cite [S158] for the perfect answer criteria and [S166] for the truthfulness metric handling hallucinations and missing answers."

[S57] We also design an effective automatic evaluation mechanism to allow for fast evaluations and\niterations (Section 4). [S58] Our third contribution is a comprehensive evaluation of straightforward RAG solutions and industry\nstate-of-the-art solutions on RAG (Section 5). [S59] Whereas most advanced LLMs achieve \u010f 34%\naccuracy on CRAG, adding RAG in a straightforward manner improves the accuracy only to 44%. [S60] State-of-the-art industry RAG solutions answer only 63% questions without any hallucination, still\nhaving much lower accuracy in answering questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower\npopularity, or higher complexity. [S61] These evaluations serve two roles: first, they demonstrate that\nCRAG has appropriate level of difficulty and allows insights drawn from different dimensions of\ndiversities the benchmark has incorporated; second, they highlight the gaps and research directions to\na fully trustworthy QA system. [S62] The CRAG benchmark laid the groundwork for a KDD Cup 2024 challenge2, has attracted thousands\nof participants and submissions within the first 50 days of the competition. [S63] We commit to maintaining\nCRAG to serve research communities in advancing RAG solutions and general QA solutions. [S64] Comparison with existing benchmarks. [S65] Table 1 compares CRAG with existing benchmarks for\nfactual question answering. [S66] Traditional QA benchmarks such as Natural Questions (NQ) [18],\nTriviaQA [16], MS MARCO [4], and QALD-10 [35] have advanced QA in the past decade but\nconsider only web retrieved or KG retrieved contents, and do not adequately represent the diverse\nand dynamic challenges that RAG is facing. [S67] New benchmarks for LLM or RAG usually target certain\ncapabilities of the QA system. [S68] Researchers created benchmarks to evaluate how well the systems\ncan answer simple knowledge questions [23, 29, 30] and handle more advanced scenarios. [S69] These\ninclude answering questions with changing answers [36], integrating information from multiple\ndocuments [6], addressing multi-hop questions [33], and answering questions with long texts [26]. [S70] Moreover, traditional QA benchmarks usually adopt matching-based metrics such as ROUGE [21]\nor F1 to evaluate the quality of the responses [16, 18]. [S71] These metrics, although working well for\nextractive methods, are known to not perform very effectively for LLMs that generate free-form\nresponses [11]. [S72] Despite CRAG being smaller than MS MARCO and NQ, it offers several distinctive advantages:\ncomprehensive coverage, realistic testing with mock APIs, dynamic question handling, diverse fact\npopularity, extensive content beyond Wikipedia, and fast yet reliable evaluation. [S73] These features make\nCRAG a robust and versatile benchmark for testing RAG systems and broadly QA systems, providing\na shared testbed to evaluate how these systems handle real-world, dynamic, and diverse information\nretrieval and synthesis challenges for reliable LLM-based question answering. [S74] 2 Problem Description\n\nA RAG QA system takes a question Q as input and outputs an answer A; the answer is generated\nby LLMs according to information retrieved from external sources or directly from the knowledge\ninternalized in the model. [S75] The answer should provide useful information to answer the question\nwithout adding any hallucination. [S76] 2https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/meta-comprehensive-rag-benchmark-kdd-cup-2024\n\n3\n\n\fTable 2: Definition of CRAG question types. [S77] Question type\n\nDefinition\n\nSimple\n\nQuestions asking for simple facts that are unlikely to change overtime, such as the\nbirth date of a person and the authors of a book. [S78] Simple w. [S79] Condition Questions asking for simple facts with some given conditions, such as stock prices\n\non a certain date and a director\u2019s recent movies in a certain genre. [S80] Set\n\nPassage 2:\n[S210] time and fast-changing facts, for tail entities, and for complex questions requiring set answers,\npost-processing, and with false premises. [S211] Second, it shows where it is harder to leverage retrieval\nresults. [S212] Take the popularity slices as an example, we observed that GPT-4 Turbo\u2019s truthfulness\ndropped from head (21%) to torso (11%) to tail (8%), consistent with past observations [29]; however,\nthe straightforward RAG solution based on GPT-4 Turbo improved QA quality regarding torso\n(+7%) and tail entities (+6%) but lowered the quality regarding head (-4%). [S213] Finally, although\nour goal is not to compare different LLMs, the different dimensions allow us to understand the\nstrengths and weaknesses of each method. [S214] For example, although the RAG system based on Llama\n3 70B Instruct has a lower overall truthfulness score than the one based on GPT-4 Turbo, it has a\nsimilar or slightly higher truthfulness in answering simple and comparison questions, whereas much\nlower truthfulness in answering set and post-processing questions, suggesting investigations on the\nreasoning capabilities. [S215] 5.2 State-of-the-art industry solutions\n\nNext, we evaluated industry state-of-the-art (SOTA) RAG solutions on CRAG public test set. [S216] We\nselected five RAG systems built upon SOTA LLMs and search engines, queried them with CRAG\nquestions, collected the responses, and applied manual grading (details in Appendix A.4). [S217] In addition, we applied traffic weights to the questions to understand the solutions in real-world use\ncases. [S218] The traffic weights reflect the frequency of each question type, as defined in Table 2, in real\nQA traffic. [S219] We gave the same weights to all domains and reported the macro average across domains. [S220] This is because we have observed quite different domain-level distributions in different use cases, but\nhave been observing similar distributions at the query-type level. [S221] Table 6 and Figure 4 show the overall performance of the SOTA systems and their performance\nacross different dimensions. [S222] The evaluation results confirm our belief that the CRAG benchmark\nreveals interesting insights and shows room for improvement for existing RAG solutions. [S223] First,\nthe results from SOTA solutions achieve much better truthfulness (highest 51%) compared to the\nstraightforward solutions. [S224] However, the hallucination rate ranges from 16% to 25%, so the answers\nare still not trustworthy. [S225] Note that the truthfulness scores between the SOTA solutions and the\nstraightforward solutions are not completely comparable, as they have different accesses to retrieval\ncontents (Appendix A.3 and A.4.1), and the former used auto-eval, while the latter used human-eval;\nhowever, the trend is valid. [S226] Second, we observed very different latency, ranging from 3.4s to 11.6s,\nreflecting the different design options in trading off latency and quality; for example, Copilot Pro\nhas the highest truthfulness, but meanwhile highest latency, whereas Meta SG [10] has mid-tier\ntruthfulness but lowest latency. [S227] (See Appendix A.4.2 for additional results and how we measured\nlatency.) Third, most difficult slices we see in the straightforward solutions remain to be difficult for\nSOTA solutions: real-time and fast-changing queries, and questions regarding torso and tail entities,\nshowing the improvement needed for handling retrieval noises when the system relies on retrieval\nresults to answer the question; as another example, we see lower truthfulness for queries requiring\naggregation, multi-hop reasoning or post-processing, showing the improvement space for reasoning\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 4: SOTA systems human-eval truthfulness scores (in percentage) across different dimensions. [S228] in question answering. [S229] Last, truthfulness on set and false premise questions improved significantly\nin the SOTA solutions compared to the straightforward solutions, showing advancement in RAG\nsystems in providing accurate and complete set answers and detecting false premises.

[S57] We also design an effective automatic evaluation mechanism to allow for fast evaluations and\niterations (Section 4). [S58] Our third contribution is a comprehensive evaluation of straightforward RAG solutions and industry\nstate-of-the-art solutions on RAG (Section 5). [S59] Whereas most advanced LLMs achieve \u010f 34%\naccuracy on CRAG, adding RAG in a straightforward manner improves the accuracy only to 44%. [S60] State-of-the-art industry RAG solutions answer only 63% questions without any hallucination, still\nhaving much lower accuracy in answering questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower\npopularity, or higher complexity. [S61] These evaluations serve two roles: first, they demonstrate that\nCRAG has appropriate level of difficulty and allows insights drawn from different dimensions of\ndiversities the benchmark has incorporated; second, they highlight the gaps and research directions to\na fully trustworthy QA system. [S62] The CRAG benchmark laid the groundwork for a KDD Cup 2024 challenge2, has attracted thousands\nof participants and submissions within the first 50 days of the competition. [S63] We commit to maintaining\nCRAG to serve research communities in advancing RAG solutions and general QA solutions. [S64] Comparison with existing benchmarks. [S65] Table 1 compares CRAG with existing benchmarks for\nfactual question answering. [S66] Traditional QA benchmarks such as Natural Questions (NQ) [18],\nTriviaQA [16], MS MARCO [4], and QALD-10 [35] have advanced QA in the past decade but\nconsider only web retrieved or KG retrieved contents, and do not adequately represent the diverse\nand dynamic challenges that RAG is facing. [S67] New benchmarks for LLM or RAG usually target certain\ncapabilities of the QA system. [S68] Researchers created benchmarks to evaluate how well the systems\ncan answer simple knowledge questions [23, 29, 30] and handle more advanced scenarios. [S69] These\ninclude answering questions with changing answers [36], integrating information from multiple\ndocuments [6], addressing multi-hop questions [33], and answering questions with long texts [26]. [S70] Moreover, traditional QA benchmarks usually adopt matching-based metrics such as ROUGE [21]\nor F1 to evaluate the quality of the responses [16, 18]. [S71] These metrics, although working well for\nextractive methods, are known to not perform very effectively for LLMs that generate free-form\nresponses [11]. [S72] Despite CRAG being smaller than MS MARCO and NQ, it offers several distinctive advantages:\ncomprehensive coverage, realistic testing with mock APIs, dynamic question handling, diverse fact\npopularity, extensive content beyond Wikipedia, and fast yet reliable evaluation. [S73] These features make\nCRAG a robust and versatile benchmark for testing RAG systems and broadly QA systems, providing\na shared testbed to evaluate how these systems handle real-world, dynamic, and diverse information\nretrieval and synthesis challenges for reliable LLM-based question answering. [S74] 2 Problem Description\n\nA RAG QA system takes a question Q as input and outputs an answer A; the answer is generated\nby LLMs according to information retrieved from external sources or directly from the knowledge\ninternalized in the model. [S75] The answer should provide useful information to answer the question\nwithout adding any hallucination. [S76] 2https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/meta-comprehensive-rag-benchmark-kdd-cup-2024\n\n3\n\n\fTable 2: Definition of CRAG question types. [S77] Question type\n\nDefinition\n\nSimple\n\nQuestions asking for simple facts that are unlikely to change overtime, such as the\nbirth date of a person and the authors of a book. [S78] Simple w. [S79] Condition Questions asking for simple facts with some given conditions, such as stock prices\n\non a certain date and a director\u2019s recent movies in a certain genre. [S80] Set",
        "[S210] time and fast-changing facts, for tail entities, and for complex questions requiring set answers,\npost-processing, and with false premises. [S211] Second, it shows where it is harder to leverage retrieval\nresults. [S212] Take the popularity slices as an example, we observed that GPT-4 Turbo\u2019s truthfulness\ndropped from head (21%) to torso (11%) to tail (8%), consistent with past observations [29]; however,\nthe straightforward RAG solution based on GPT-4 Turbo improved QA quality regarding torso\n(+7%) and tail entities (+6%) but lowered the quality regarding head (-4%). [S213] Finally, although\nour goal is not to compare different LLMs, the different dimensions allow us to understand the\nstrengths and weaknesses of each method. [S214] For example, although the RAG system based on Llama\n3 70B Instruct has a lower overall truthfulness score than the one based on GPT-4 Turbo, it has a\nsimilar or slightly higher truthfulness in answering simple and comparison questions, whereas much\nlower truthfulness in answering set and post-processing questions, suggesting investigations on the\nreasoning capabilities. [S215] 5.2 State-of-the-art industry solutions\n\nNext, we evaluated industry state-of-the-art (SOTA) RAG solutions on CRAG public test set. [S216] We\nselected five RAG systems built upon SOTA LLMs and search engines, queried them with CRAG\nquestions, collected the responses, and applied manual grading (details in Appendix A.4). [S217] In addition, we applied traffic weights to the questions to understand the solutions in real-world use\ncases. [S218] The traffic weights reflect the frequency of each question type, as defined in Table 2, in real\nQA traffic. [S219] We gave the same weights to all domains and reported the macro average across domains. [S220] This is because we have observed quite different domain-level distributions in different use cases, but\nhave been observing similar distributions at the query-type level. [S221] Table 6 and Figure 4 show the overall performance of the SOTA systems and their performance\nacross different dimensions. [S222] The evaluation results confirm our belief that the CRAG benchmark\nreveals interesting insights and shows room for improvement for existing RAG solutions. [S223] First,\nthe results from SOTA solutions achieve much better truthfulness (highest 51%) compared to the\nstraightforward solutions. [S224] However, the hallucination rate ranges from 16% to 25%, so the answers\nare still not trustworthy. [S225] Note that the truthfulness scores between the SOTA solutions and the\nstraightforward solutions are not completely comparable, as they have different accesses to retrieval\ncontents (Appendix A.3 and A.4.1), and the former used auto-eval, while the latter used human-eval;\nhowever, the trend is valid. [S226] Second, we observed very different latency, ranging from 3.4s to 11.6s,\nreflecting the different design options in trading off latency and quality; for example, Copilot Pro\nhas the highest truthfulness, but meanwhile highest latency, whereas Meta SG [10] has mid-tier\ntruthfulness but lowest latency. [S227] (See Appendix A.4.2 for additional results and how we measured\nlatency.) Third, most difficult slices we see in the straightforward solutions remain to be difficult for\nSOTA solutions: real-time and fast-changing queries, and questions regarding torso and tail entities,\nshowing the improvement needed for handling retrieval noises when the system relies on retrieval\nresults to answer the question; as another example, we see lower truthfulness for queries requiring\naggregation, multi-hop reasoning or post-processing, showing the improvement space for reasoning\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 4: SOTA systems human-eval truthfulness scores (in percentage) across different dimensions. [S228] in question answering. [S229] Last, truthfulness on set and false premise questions improved significantly\nin the SOTA solutions compared to the straightforward solutions, showing advancement in RAG\nsystems in providing accurate and complete set answers and detecting false premises.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the three key contributions of the CRAG benchmark and how they address the limitations of traditional QA benchmarks. I need to look through the provided passage to find the relevant sections.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of contributions. There's a part that says: \"Our third contribution is a comprehensive evaluation of straightforward RAG solutions and industry state-of-the-art solutions on RAG (Section 5).\" But wait, the question is about three contributions. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a sentence that mentions three contributions. Let me check the sentences again. Here's a part: \"We also design an effective automatic evaluation mechanism to allow for fast evaluations and iterations (Section 4). [S58] Our third contribution is a comprehensive evaluation of straightforward RAG solutions and industry state-of-the-art solutions on RAG (Section 5).\" Wait, that's two contributions. Maybe there's another one.\n\nAnother part says: \"The CRAG benchmark laid the groundwork for a KDD Cup 2024 challenge2, has attracted thousands of participants and submissions within the first 50 days of the competition.\" But that seems more like an outcome rather than a contribution. \n\nWait, the user is asking for three key contributions. Let me check the passage again. There's a sentence: \"These features make CRAG a robust and versatile benchmark...\" but that's describing the features, not the contributions. \n\nLooking back, the user's question mentions that the source context should be used. Let me check the exact sentences. \n\nIn the passage, there's a section that starts with \"Our third contribution...\" but earlier there's a mention of \"We also design an effective automatic evaluation mechanism...\" which might be the second contribution. Then the third is the comprehensive evaluation. But where's the first contribution? \n\nWait, maybe the first contribution is the comprehensive coverage and realistic testing with mock APIs, dynamic questions, etc. The passage says: \"Despite CRAG being smaller than MS MARCO and NQ, it offers several distinctive advantages: comprehensive coverage, realistic testing with mock APIs, dynamic question handling, diverse fact popularity, extensive content beyond Wikipedia, and fast yet reliable evaluation.\" But is this considered a contribution? \n\nAlternatively, the three contributions might be: 1) Effective automatic evaluation mechanism, 2) Comprehensive evaluation of RAG solutions, and 3) The benchmark's features like dynamic questions and diverse content. But the passage explicitly mentions \"third contribution\" as the comprehensive evaluation. The first two contributions might be the automatic evaluation and the benchmark's design. \n\nAlso, the question asks how they address the limitations of traditional benchmarks. Traditional benchmarks have issues like only considering web or KG retrieved content, not dynamic challenges, and using matching-based metrics. The CRAG contributions address these by including dynamic questions, diverse fact popularity, and realistic testing with mock APIs, etc. \n\nSo, the three contributions are: 1) Effective automatic evaluation mechanism, 2) Comprehensive evaluation of RAG solutions, and 3) The benchmark's features (dynamic questions, diverse content, etc.). But I need to confirm from the text. \n\nThe passage mentions: \"Our third contribution is a comprehensive evaluation...\" which implies there are at least three contributions. The first two might be the automatic evaluation mechanism and the benchmark's design. However, the exact sentences might be in the context. \n\nLooking at the sentences again: [S57] mentions the automatic evaluation mechanism. [S58] is the third contribution. Then maybe the first contribution is the benchmark's design with features like dynamic questions, etc. But the text doesn't explicitly list three contributions. However, the user's question states that the source context describes three key contributions, so I need to infer them from the text. \n\nAnother part says: \"We commit to maintaining CRAG to serve research communities...\" but that's not a contribution. \n\nAlternatively, the three contributions could be: 1) The benchmark's design with dynamic and diverse challenges, 2) The automatic evaluation mechanism, and 3) The comprehensive evaluation of RAG solutions. \n\nThe answer should cite the relevant sentences. For example, the automatic evaluation is in [S57], the comprehensive evaluation in [S58], and the features in [S72] and [S73]. But the exact contributions need to be identified. \n\nSo, the three key contributions as per the text are: 1) Effective automatic evaluation mechanism (S57), 2) Comprehensive evaluation of RAG solutions (S58), and 3) The benchmark's features like dynamic questions, diverse fact popularity, etc. (S72, S73). \n\nThen, how they address traditional limitations: Traditional benchmarks don't handle dynamic content, diverse facts, etc. CRAG's contributions address these by including dynamic questions, diverse content, and realistic testing."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the CRAG benchmark differs from traditional QA benchmarks in terms of evaluation metrics and testing scenarios, and what specific features make it more suitable for evaluating RAG systems.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided passage to find relevant information. Let me start by scanning the sections that discuss CRAG's differences. \n\nIn the supporting context, there's a part that says: \"Traditional QA benchmarks such as Natural Questions (NQ), TriviaQA, MS MARCO, and QALD-10 have advanced QA in the past decade but consider only web retrieved or KG retrieved contents, and do not adequately represent the diverse and dynamic challenges that RAG is facing.\" That's from sentence S66. So, traditional benchmarks only use web or KG retrieval, but CRAG has more diverse and dynamic challenges.\n\nThen, looking at evaluation metrics: \"Traditional QA benchmarks usually adopt matching-based metrics such as ROUGE or F1 to evaluate the quality of the responses... These metrics... are known to not perform very effectively for LLMs that generate free-form responses.\" This is from S70 and S71. So CRAG probably uses different metrics, maybe more suited for LLMs. The passage mentions CRAG's evaluation includes \"comprehensive coverage, realistic testing with mock APIs, dynamic question handling, diverse fact popularity, extensive content beyond Wikipedia, and fast yet reliable evaluation.\" (S72) These features make it better for RAG.\n\nAlso, the passage states that CRAG includes \"dynamic question handling\" and \"realistic testing with mock APIs,\" which are specific features. The question types in CRAG include things like set answers, post-processing, and false premises, which are covered in Table 2 (S77). \n\nAnother point is that CRAG evaluates not just accuracy but also handling of dynamic and complex queries, which traditional benchmarks don't. The passage mentions that CRAG's evaluation highlights gaps in handling facts with higher dynamism, lower popularity, or complexity. \n\nSo, putting this together, the differences in evaluation metrics are that traditional ones use ROUGE/F1, which aren't great for LLMs, while CRAG uses metrics that are more effective for free-form responses. Testing scenarios in CRAG include dynamic questions, mock APIs, diverse fact popularity, and beyond Wikipedia content. Specific features making CRAG suitable are comprehensive coverage, dynamic handling, mock APIs, diverse facts, and fast evaluation.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is cited correctly. For example, the part about traditional benchmarks using ROUGE/F1 is from S70 and S71. The features of CRAG are in S72. The mention of dynamic questions and mock APIs is also in S72. The comparison with traditional benchmarks is in S66. Also, the part about CRAG's evaluation showing insights and gaps is in S61. \n\nI should structure the answer with each statement and the relevant citations. Need to check if all the points are covered and cited properly."

[S60] State-of-the-art industry RAG solutions answer only 63% questions without any hallucination, still\nhaving much lower accuracy in answering questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower\npopularity, or higher complexity.

[S62] The CRAG benchmark laid the groundwork for a KDD Cup 2024 challenge2, has attracted thousands\nof participants and submissions within the first 50 days of the competition. [S63] We commit to maintaining\nCRAG to serve research communities in advancing RAG solutions and general QA solutions. [S64] Comparison with existing benchmarks. [S65] Table 1 compares CRAG with existing benchmarks for\nfactual question answering. [S66] Traditional QA benchmarks such as Natural Questions (NQ) [18],\nTriviaQA [16], MS MARCO [4], and QALD-10 [35] have advanced QA in the past decade but\nconsider only web retrieved or KG retrieved contents, and do not adequately represent the diverse\nand dynamic challenges that RAG is facing. [S67] New benchmarks for LLM or RAG usually target certain\ncapabilities of the QA system. [S68] Researchers created benchmarks to evaluate how well the systems\ncan answer simple knowledge questions [23, 29, 30] and handle more advanced scenarios. [S69] These\ninclude answering questions with changing answers [36], integrating information from multiple\ndocuments [6], addressing multi-hop questions [33], and answering questions with long texts [26]. [S70] Moreover, traditional QA benchmarks usually adopt matching-based metrics such as ROUGE [21]\nor F1 to evaluate the quality of the responses [16, 18]. [S71] These metrics, although working well for\nextractive methods, are known to not perform very effectively for LLMs that generate free-form\nresponses [11]. [S72] Despite CRAG being smaller than MS MARCO and NQ, it offers several distinctive advantages:\ncomprehensive coverage, realistic testing with mock APIs, dynamic question handling, diverse fact\npopularity, extensive content beyond Wikipedia, and fast yet reliable evaluation. [S73] These features make\nCRAG a robust and versatile benchmark for testing RAG systems and broadly QA systems, providing\na shared testbed to evaluate how these systems handle real-world, dynamic, and diverse information\nretrieval and synthesis challenges for reliable LLM-based question answering. [S74] 2 Problem Description\n\nA RAG QA system takes a question Q as input and outputs an answer A; the answer is generated\nby LLMs according to information retrieved from external sources or directly from the knowledge\ninternalized in the model. [S75] The answer should provide useful information to answer the question\nwithout adding any hallucination.

[S211] Second, it shows where it is harder to leverage retrieval\nresults. [S212] Take the popularity slices as an example, we observed that GPT-4 Turbo\u2019s truthfulness\ndropped from head (21%) to torso (11%) to tail (8%), consistent with past observations [29]; however,\nthe straightforward RAG solution based on GPT-4 Turbo improved QA quality regarding torso\n(+7%) and tail entities (+6%) but lowered the quality regarding head (-4%). [S213] Finally, although\nour goal is not to compare different LLMs, the different dimensions allow us to understand the\nstrengths and weaknesses of each method. [S214] For example, although the RAG system based on Llama\n3 70B Instruct has a lower overall truthfulness score than the one based on GPT-4 Turbo, it has a\nsimilar or slightly higher truthfulness in answering simple and comparison questions, whereas much\nlower truthfulness in answering set and post-processing questions, suggesting investigations on the\nreasoning capabilities.

[S216] We\nselected five RAG systems built upon SOTA LLMs and search engines, queried them with CRAG\nquestions, collected the responses, and applied manual grading (details in Appendix A.4).

The user is asking about the performance comparison between LLMs and RAG systems on the CRAG benchmark and the challenges it highlights for RAG solutions.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information. The abstract mentions that most advanced LLMs achieve around 34% accuracy on CRAG, while adding RAG improves it to 44%. Also, state-of-the-art RAG solutions answer 63% without hallucination. Then, in Passage 2, there's more detail: the best LLM-only solutions (GPT-4 Turbo) have 34% accuracy and 20% truthfulness. RAG solutions get up to 44% accuracy but no higher than 20% truthfulness because of hallucinations from irrelevant retrievals. There's also mention of challenges like handling dynamic facts, low popularity entities, and complex questions.\n\nI need to structure the answer with citations. The key points are the accuracy numbers for LLMs and RAG, the truthfulness rates, and the challenges like hallucinations, retrieval noise, and handling dynamic/knowledge-rich questions. Each statement should have the correct citations. Let me check the sentence numbers again to make sure I reference the right ones. For example, the 34% and 44% are from S8 and S9. The 63% is from S10. The truthfulness issues are in S193. The challenges are mentioned in the introduction and Passage 2. I need to make sure each part is cited properly without missing any."

[S15] Despite the advancements,\nthe issue of hallucination persists as a significant challenge; LLMs may generate answers that lack\nfactual accuracy or grounding [14,27,30,32]. [S16] Studies have shown that GPT-4\u2019s accuracy in answering\nquestions referring to slow-changing or fast-changing facts is below 15% [36]; even for stable (never-\nchanging) facts, GPT-4\u2019s accuracy in answering questions referring to torso-to-tail (less popular)\nentities is below 35% [29]. [S17] Overcoming hallucinations thus becomes a priority in building reliable\nQA systems [13, 14]. [S18] Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [6, 8, 12, 19] has recently emerged as a promising solution to\nalleviate LLM\u2019s deficiency in lack of knowledge and attracted a lot of attention from both academia\nresearch and industry. [S19] Given a question, a RAG system searches external sources to retrieve relevant\ninformation and then provides grounded answers [7, 12, 19] (see Figure 1 for an illustration).

        "[S190] Table 5 shows the average evaluation results from the two auto-evaluators (ChatGPT and Llama 3) and\nillustrates that the CRAG benchmark is non-trivial. [S191] First, the best LLM-only solutions (GPT-4 Turbo)\nobtained an accuracy of only 34%, with truthfulness of 20%, showing a big room for improvement. [S192] Second, straightforward RAG solutions obtained up to 44% accuracy, showing that extra information\ndoes help answer more questions reliably. [S193] Interestingly, none of the RAG solutions obtain truthfulness\nhigher than 20%; this is because all RAG solutions introduce more hallucinations generated from\nirrelevant retrieval results, showing a big challenge in RAG\u2014How to judiciously use retrieval results\nwithout being distracted by retrieval noises? [S194] Third, we found that Task 2 truthfulness scores are\nhigher than Task 1, showing that the KG knowledge helps improve accuracy, with a similar or even\nlower hallucination rate, because the KG knowledge is typically brief but precise. [S195] Unfortunately, the\nimprovement is mediocre, showing a second challenge in RAG\u2014How to best leverage the power of\nKG data? [S196] Finally, the truthfulness for Task 3 are also higher than Task 2, because of better search\nranking (recall that Task 1 and 2 provide five pages randomly selected from the top-10 search results)\nand better search recall. [S197] In particular, we found that the ground truths of over 30% of questions are\navailable in the web retrieval results but are not included in the prompt due to the context window\nlimitation.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the factors that contribute to lower RAG truthfulness in specific domains and question types, and how the CRAG benchmark reveals these issues. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information. The passage mentions several points. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nIn the abstract, there's a mention that CRAG reveals lower accuracy in answering questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower popularity, or higher complexity. That's a key point. So factors like dynamism, popularity, and complexity are mentioned here. The citations for this would be [S11].\n\nLooking further into the introduction and other sections, there's a part where it says that RAG truthfulness is lower in Finance and Sports domains. This is cited in [S202]. Also, the CRAG benchmark's evaluation shows that certain domains and question types have lower performance. \n\nIn Passage 2, Table 5 and the following text discuss how RAG solutions have issues with hallucinations, especially when retrieval results are irrelevant. This points to challenges in handling retrieval noises. The citation here is [S193]. Additionally, the CRAG benchmark's analysis across domains, dynamism, popularity, and question types is mentioned in [S199], and the specific examples like Finance and Sports domains are in [S202].\n\nThe question types mentioned include simple, complex, multi-hop, etc., which are part of the CRAG's categorization. The text also notes that tasks involving KG knowledge (Task 2) had higher truthfulness but with mediocre improvement, indicating another challenge in leveraging KG data, cited in [S195].\n\nPutting this together, the factors contributing to lower RAG truthfulness are higher dynamism, lower popularity, higher complexity, specific domains like Finance and Sports, and certain question types. The CRAG benchmark reveals these issues by evaluating across these dimensions and highlighting where performance drops, as seen in the cited sections.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is properly cited. For example, when mentioning domains, cite [S202], for dynamism and complexity cite [S11], and the challenges in RAG like hallucinations from retrieval noises cite [S193]. Also, the overall structure of the CRAG benchmark's design is mentioned in [S6] and [S7], but the specific issues are in the later citations."

[S191] First, the best LLM-only solutions (GPT-4 Turbo)\nobtained an accuracy of only 34%, with truthfulness of 20%, showing a big room for improvement. [S192] Second, straightforward RAG solutions obtained up to 44% accuracy, showing that extra information\ndoes help answer more questions reliably. [S193] Interestingly, none of the RAG solutions obtain truthfulness\nhigher than 20%; this is because all RAG solutions introduce more hallucinations generated from\nirrelevant retrieval results, showing a big challenge in RAG\u2014How to judiciously use retrieval results\nwithout being distracted by retrieval noises? [S194] Third, we found that Task 2 truthfulness scores are\nhigher than Task 1, showing that the KG knowledge helps improve accuracy, with a similar or even\nlower hallucination rate, because the KG knowledge is typically brief but precise. [S195] Unfortunately, the\nimprovement is mediocre, showing a second challenge in RAG\u2014How to best leverage the power of\nKG data? [S196] Finally, the truthfulness for Task 3 are also higher than Task 2, because of better search\nranking (recall that Task 1 and 2 provide five pages randomly selected from the top-10 search results)\nand better search recall. [S197] In particular, we found that the ground truths of over 30% of questions are\navailable in the web retrieval results but are not included in the prompt due to the context window\nlimitation. [S198] This shows the importance of search ranking in RAG. [S199] Figure 3 shows the auto-eval results across the domain, dynamism, popularity, and question type\ndimension. [S200] The results reveal a lot of interesting observations and show that the CRAG benchmark\nallows more insightful conclusions. [S201] First, it shows which slices of the benchmark are harder.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the CRAG benchmark evaluates the impact of search ranking and knowledge graph (KG) data on QA accuracy and hallucination rates.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information. The passage mentions CRAG's evaluation in several places. Let me scan through the sentences.\n\nLooking at the abstract part, there's a mention of CRAG being a benchmark with mock APIs to simulate web and KG search. That's probably relevant. Then, in the evaluation section, it says that adding RAG improves accuracy from 34% to 44%, which shows the impact of retrieval. But the user is specifically asking about search ranking and KG data.\n\nIn Passage 2, there's a lot more detail. For example, Table 5 discusses the results from auto-evaluators. It mentions that Task 2 (which uses KG) has higher truthfulness than Task 1, indicating that KG data helps. Also, Task 3 has higher truthfulness than Task 2 because of better search ranking and recall. This suggests that search ranking affects the results. \n\nAnother part says that over 30% of ground truths are in web results but not in the prompt due to context limits, highlighting the importance of search ranking. Also, the comparison between Task 1 (random pages) and Task 3 (better search) shows that better ranking improves accuracy. \n\nThe passage also mentions that KG data is brief but precise, leading to similar or lower hallucination rates. However, the improvement from KG is mediocre, pointing to challenges in leveraging KG effectively. \n\nSo, putting this together: CRAG evaluates search ranking by comparing different search strategies (like Task 1 vs. Task 3) and shows that better ranking (higher recall, better positioning) increases accuracy and reduces hallucinations. For KG data, Task 2 (using KG) vs. Task 1 (web only) shows that KG improves accuracy with lower hallucination, but there's still room for improvement. \n\nI need to cite the relevant sentences. The parts about Task 2 and Task 3 comparisons are in [S194], [S195], [S196], [S197], and [S198]. Also, the mention of mock APIs in [S6] and the evaluation results in [S8], [S9], [S10], [S11]. \n\nWait, the user specifically asked about search ranking and KG data. So the key sentences would be those that directly compare the impact of these factors. For example, [S194] talks about RAG solutions introducing more hallucinations, but [S195] mentions KG helping improve accuracy with lower hallucination. [S197] discusses better search ranking leading to higher truthfulness. [S198] emphasizes the importance of search ranking. \n\nAlso, the abstract mentions the mock APIs for web and KG search, which is part of the evaluation setup. So [S6] is relevant. \n\nI need to structure the answer with statements that explain how CRAG evaluates these factors, citing the appropriate sentences. Each statement should be in <statement> tags with citations in <cite>."

[S32] In other\nwords, a solution that achieves high metrics in the benchmark shall also perform very well in\nreal scenarios. [S33] For example, the questions in a RAG benchmark shall be similar to questions\npeople ask in real-world QA scenarios. [S34] 2.

[S48] As we generated the questions, we referred\nto smart assistant use cases to make sure the questions are realistic, paraphrased the questions to\nincrease the diversity of expressions, and manually verified ground truths to ensure reliability. [S49] In addition to QA pairs, CRAG provides mock APIs to simulate retrieval from a diverse range of\navailable information.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the five critical features of the CRAG benchmark and how it ensures realism by incorporating smart assistant use cases.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage starts by mentioning that the CRAG benchmark has five critical features. Let me scan through the text to find those.\n\nLooking at the passage, there's a section that starts with \"We consider five critical features.\" Then each feature is listed with numbers 1 to 5. Let me check each one:\n\n1. Realism: The text says the benchmark should reflect real use cases, and examples include questions similar to real-world QA scenarios. Also, they mention referring to smart assistant use cases to ensure realism. [S31, S33, S48]\n\n2. Richness: The benchmark has diverse instance types, covering common and complex use cases. [S35]\n\n3. Insightfulness: Allows understanding performance on different data slices. [S37]\n\n4. Reliability: Accurate ground truths, reliable metrics, and statistical significance. [S39]\n\n5. Longevity: Data and scenarios shouldn't expire and should be updated. [S41]\n\nNow, the second part of the question is about how CRAG ensures realism through smart assistant use cases. The passage mentions in [S48] that during question generation, they referred to smart assistant use cases to make questions realistic. Also, they paraphrased questions and manually verified ground truths.\n\nSo, the five features are Realism, Richness, Insightfulness, Reliability, Longevity. The realism is ensured by using smart assistant scenarios, paraphrasing, and manual verification.\n\nI need to structure the answer with each feature and cite the relevant sentences. For the realism part, cite [S31][S33][S48]. Also, check if other sentences relate to the features. For example, the features are listed in [S29]-[S30], but the actual details are in the following sentences. So each feature's description is in the subsequent sentences. \n\nMake sure each statement is in <statement> tags with proper citations. Also, ensure that each sentence is properly cited. For example, the first feature's description is in [S31], [S32], [S33]. But the user might want each feature mentioned with their respective citations. \n\nWait, the user wants the five critical features and how realism is ensured. So the answer should list the five features, each with their citations, and then explain the realism part with citations. But according to the response format, each sentence is a separate statement with citations. So maybe break down each feature into separate statements.\n\nBut the user might expect a concise answer. Let me check the example given. The example has two sentences, each with their own citations. So perhaps each feature is a separate statement, and the realism explanation is another statement.\n\nSo, the answer would be:\n\n<statement>The five critical features of the CRAG benchmark are Realism, Richness, Insightfulness, Reliability, and Longevity.<cite>[S29][S30]</cite></statement>\n<statement>Realism ensures that the benchmark reflects real-world use cases, such as questions similar to those asked in actual scenarios, by referring to smart assistant use cases during question generation.<cite>[S31][S33][S48]</cite></statement>\n<statement>Richness involves a diverse set of instance types, covering both common and complex use cases to represent real-world challenges.<cite>[S35]</cite></statement>\n<statement>Insightfulness allows for understanding performance across different data slices, reflecting the solution's capability to address various challenges.<cite>[S37]</cite></statement>\n<statement>Reliability ensures accurate ground truths, reliable metrics, and statistically significant evaluations.<cite>[S39]</cite></statement>\n<statement>Longevity ensures the benchmark remains relevant over time through periodic updates and improvements.<cite>[S41]</cite></statement>\n\nWait, but the initial mention of the five features is in [S29] and [S30]. The actual features are listed in [S29] as \"We consider five critical features.\" Then each feature is numbered 1-5. The sentences describing each feature are in [S31] (Realism), [S35] (Richness), [S37] (Insightfulness), [S39] (Reliability), [S41] (Longevity). \n\nSo the first statement could be listing the five features, citing [S29][S30]. Then each feature's description is in their respective sentences. However, the user might want each feature's name and description. But the exact wording in the passage is:\n\n[S29] We consider five critical features.\n[S30] 1. [S31] Realism: First and foremost, a good benchmark shall best reflect real use cases. [S32] In other words, a solution that achieves high metrics in the benchmark shall also perform very well in real scenarios. [S33] For example, the questions in a RAG benchmark shall be similar to questions people ask in real-world QA scenarios. [S34] 2. [S35] Richness: The benchmark shall contain a diverse set of instance types, covering both common use cases and some complex and advanced use cases, to represent real-world challenges and reveal possible limitations of existing solutions. [S36] 3. [S37] Insightfulness: The benchmark shall allow for an easy understanding of performance on different slices of the data, reflecting the capability of the solution in addressing different types of challenges. [S38] 4. [S39] Reliability: The benchmark shall allow reliable assessment of metrics: the ground truths shall be accurate; the metrics shall well capture the performance of the model; the evaluation shall be easy and reliable, and the computed metrics shall hold statistical significance. [S40] 5. [S41] Longevity: Finally, to enable research and experimental comparison in a long term, the scenarios and the data in the benchmark shall not quickly expire and ideally shall be refreshed and improved over time.\n\nSo the five features are Realism, Richness, Insightfulness, Reliability, Longevity. Each is described in the subsequent sentences. So the first statement could be the list of features, citing [S29][S30], then each feature's description with their respective citations. \n\nBut the user's question is to list the five features and explain how CRAG ensures realism via smart assistant use cases. So the answer should have the five features, each with their citations, and then a statement about realism and smart assistant use cases, citing [S48].\n\nSo the final answer would be structured with each feature as a separate statement, and the realism part as another statement. Let me check the citations again. For example, Realism is covered in [S31][S32][S33], but the user might want the most relevant citations. The passage mentions in [S48] that they referred to smart assistant use cases to ensure realism. So that's a key citation for the realism part.\n\nSo the answer would be:\n\n<statement>The five critical features of the CRAG benchmark are Realism, Richness, Insightfulness, Reliability, and Longevity.<cite>[S29][S30]</cite></statement>\n<statement>Realism ensures that the benchmark reflects real-world use cases, such as questions similar to those asked in actual scenarios, by incorporating smart assistant use cases during question generation.<cite>[S31][S33][S48]</cite></statement>\n<statement>Richness involves a diverse set of instance types, covering both common and complex use cases to represent real-world challenges.<cite>[S35]</cite></statement>\n<statement>Insightfulness allows for understanding performance across different data slices, reflecting the solution's capability to address various challenges.<cite>[S37]</cite></statement>\n<statement>Reliability ensures accurate ground truths, reliable metrics, and statistically significant evaluations.<cite>[S39]</cite></statement>\n<statement>Longevity ensures the benchmark remains relevant over time through periodic updates and improvements.<cite>[S41]</cite></statement>\n\nThis should cover all the required points with proper citations."

[S40] 5. [S41] Longevity: Finally, to enable research and experimental comparison in a long term, the\nscenarios and the data in the benchmark shall not quickly expire and ideally shall be refreshed\nand improved over time. [S42] We strive to create a benchmark that have all of the aforementioned features, and we call it CRAG \u2013\nComprehensive benchmark for RAG. [S43] Our work makes three contributions. [S44] Our first contribution is the dataset itself (Section 3). [S45] CRAG contains a rich set of 4,409 QA pairs\nfrom five domains: Finance, Sports, Music, Movie, and Open domain. [S46] In addition to simple-fact\nquestions (asking for an attribute of an entity), CRAG contains seven types of complex questions to\ncover real user queries: questions with Conditions, Comparison questions, Aggregation questions,\nMulti-hop questions, Set queries, Post-processing-heavy questions, and False-premise questions. [S47] CRAG reflects varied entity popularity from popular to long-tail and temporal spans ranging from\nseconds to years, allowing easy deep dives for insights. [S48] As we generated the questions, we referred\nto smart assistant use cases to make sure the questions are realistic, paraphrased the questions to\nincrease the diversity of expressions, and manually verified ground truths to ensure reliability. [S49] In addition to QA pairs, CRAG provides mock APIs to simulate retrieval from a diverse range of\navailable information. [S50] This includes up to 50 full HTML pages for each question returned from a\nreal-world search engine\u2014the Brave Search API [5], and mock KGs with 2.6 million entities. [S51] For the\nmock KGs, we deliberately make sure that the retrieval candidates reflect noises in a realistic setting. [S52] Our second contribution is the evaluation mechanism to allow for reliable comparisons. [S53] We designed\n3 tasks to test different components in RAG solutions: retrieval summarization, knowledge graph\nand web retrieval, and end-to-end retrieval-augmented generation (Section 2). [S54] Instead of computing\nthe percentage of correctly answered questions, our score system distinguishes hallucinated answers\nand missing answers, and gives the former a higher penalty as it can be more harmful to ruin user\n\n2\n\nLLMWhat is the gold price today?Gold price is at $1626.81 per ounce today Oct 21 2022.Gold price is at $2020.8 per ounce today Jan 28 2024.DocumentsWeb SearchReal-time APIsKnowledge GraphRetrieved relevantknowledgeQuestion (a) LLM Direct Generation(b) RAG: Retrieved-Augmented Generation with LLM\fTable 1: Comparing CRAG to existing benchmarks for factual question answering.

[S32] In other\nwords, a solution that achieves high metrics in the benchmark shall also perform very well in\nreal scenarios. [S33] For example, the questions in a RAG benchmark shall be similar to questions\npeople ask in real-world QA scenarios. [S34] 2. [S35] Richness: The benchmark shall contain a diverse set of instance types, covering both\ncommon use cases and some complex and advanced use cases, to represent real-world\nchallenges and reveal possible limitations of existing solutions. [S36] 3. [S37] Insightfulness: The benchmark shall allow for an easy understanding of performance on\ndifferent slices of the data, reflecting the capability of the solution in addressing different\ntypes of challenges. [S38] 4. [S39] Reliability: The benchmark shall allow reliable assessment of metrics: the ground truths\nshall be accurate; the metrics shall well capture the performance of the model; the evaluation\nshall be easy and reliable, and the computed metrics shall hold statistical significance. [S40] 5. [S41] Longevity: Finally, to enable research and experimental comparison in a long term, the\nscenarios and the data in the benchmark shall not quickly expire and ideally shall be refreshed\nand improved over time. [S42] We strive to create a benchmark that have all of the aforementioned features, and we call it CRAG \u2013\nComprehensive benchmark for RAG. [S43] Our work makes three contributions. [S44] Our first contribution is the dataset itself (Section 3). [S45] CRAG contains a rich set of 4,409 QA pairs\nfrom five domains: Finance, Sports, Music, Movie, and Open domain. [S46] In addition to simple-fact\nquestions (asking for an attribute of an entity), CRAG contains seven types of complex questions to\ncover real user queries: questions with Conditions, Comparison questions, Aggregation questions,\nMulti-hop questions, Set queries, Post-processing-heavy questions, and False-premise questions. [S47] CRAG reflects varied entity popularity from popular to long-tail and temporal spans ranging from\nseconds to years, allowing easy deep dives for insights. [S48] As we generated the questions, we referred\nto smart assistant use cases to make sure the questions are realistic, paraphrased the questions to\nincrease the diversity of expressions, and manually verified ground truths to ensure reliability. [S49] In addition to QA pairs, CRAG provides mock APIs to simulate retrieval from a diverse range of\navailable information. [S50] This includes up to 50 full HTML pages for each question returned from a\nreal-world search engine\u2014the Brave Search API [5], and mock KGs with 2.6 million entities. [S51] For the\nmock KGs, we deliberately make sure that the retrieval candidates reflect noises in a realistic setting. [S52] Our second contribution is the evaluation mechanism to allow for reliable comparisons. [S53] We designed\n3 tasks to test different components in RAG solutions: retrieval summarization, knowledge graph\nand web retrieval, and end-to-end retrieval-augmented generation (Section 2). [S54] Instead of computing\nthe percentage of correctly answered questions, our score system distinguishes hallucinated answers\nand missing answers, and gives the former a higher penalty as it can be more harmful to ruin user\n\n2\n\nLLMWhat is the gold price today?Gold price is at $1626.81 per ounce today Oct 21 2022.Gold price is at $2020.8 per ounce today Jan 28 2024.DocumentsWeb SearchReal-time APIsKnowledge GraphRetrieved relevantknowledgeQuestion (a) LLM Direct Generation(b) RAG: Retrieved-Augmented Generation with LLM\fTable 1: Comparing CRAG to existing benchmarks for factual question answering.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how CRAG incorporates diverse question types and domains, and what specific keys are used for finance and movie queries.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions CRAG's features. Let me scan through the text.\n\nIn Passage 1, under the section discussing CRAG's contributions, it says that CRAG contains a rich set of 4,409 QA pairs from five domains: Finance, Sports, Music, Movie, and Open domain. That answers the part about domains. Then, it mentions that CRAG includes seven types of complex questions beyond simple-fact questions. The types listed are questions with Conditions, Comparison, Aggregation, Multi-hop, Set queries, Post-processing-heavy, and False-premise. So that's the diverse question types part.\n\nNow, for the specific keys used in finance and movie queries. Looking at Passage 2, there's a section that starts with \"For \u2018finance\u2019 queries, these are possible keys:\" and lists them: market_identifier, metric, datetime. Then for 'movie' queries, the keys are movie_name, movie_aspect, person, person_aspect, year. The answer should include these keys.\n\nI need to make sure the citations are correct. The domains and question types are mentioned in S45 and S46. The keys for finance are in S915-S919, and for movies in S920-S924. So the citations would be [S45][S46] for the domains and question types, [S915]-[S919] for finance keys, and [S920]-[S924] for movie keys. Wait, but the user wants each sentence to have its own citations. So each statement about the domains and question types should cite S45 and S46. Then the finance keys would be cited from S915 to S919, and the movie keys from S920 to S924. But each sentence needs to have its citations. So I need to structure the answer with separate statements for each part, ensuring the citations are correctly placed."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the specific keys for music and sports queries and how they contribute to the benchmark's richness and insightfulness. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The main passage has two parts. Passage 1 talks about the CRAG benchmark and its features like realism, richness, insightfulness, etc. Then there's Passage 2 which lists the specific keys for different domains, including music and sports.\n\nLooking at Passage 2, under 'music' queries, the keys are: artist_name, artist_aspect, song_name, song_aspect. The artist_aspect has options like member, birth place, etc., and song_aspect includes author, release date, etc. For sports, the keys are sport_type, tournament, team, datetime. \n\nThe question is asking how these keys contribute to the benchmark's richness and insightfulness. From Passage 1, richness is about diverse instance types covering common and complex cases. The specific keys for music and sports would add diversity by capturing various aspects of these domains. For example, music keys cover artists and songs with different attributes, while sports keys handle different sports, tournaments, and teams. This diversity makes the benchmark more comprehensive.\n\nInsightfulness refers to understanding performance on different data slices. The keys allow analyzing how well the model handles specific aspects, like music artist details or sports team performances. This helps in identifying strengths and weaknesses in different areas, making the benchmark more insightful.\n\nI need to make sure the answer cites the relevant sentences. The keys for music and sports are in Passage 2, specifically [S925] to [S928] for music and [S929] to [S932] for sports. The contribution to richness and insightfulness is explained in Passage 1, sentences [S35] for richness and [S37] for insightfulness. \n\nSo the answer should list the keys and cite the relevant passages, then explain their contribution using the benchmark's features from Passage 1."

        "[S26] A comprehensive benchmark is currently missing to advance continued research efforts in this field. [S27] Our goal is to build a benchmark that can provide a holistic view of the important capabilities and\nfast but reliable evaluation for RAG to propel the area forward. [S28] What is a good benchmark for QA\nover LLMs? [S29] We consider five critical features. [S30] 1. [S31] Realism: First and foremost, a good benchmark shall best reflect real use cases. [S32] In other\nwords, a solution that achieves high metrics in the benchmark shall also perform very well in\nreal scenarios. [S33] For example, the questions in a RAG benchmark shall be similar to questions\npeople ask in real-world QA scenarios. [S34] 2. [S35] Richness: The benchmark shall contain a diverse set of instance types, covering both\ncommon use cases and some complex and advanced use cases, to represent real-world\nchallenges and reveal possible limitations of existing solutions. [S36] 3. [S37] Insightfulness: The benchmark shall allow for an easy understanding of performance on\ndifferent slices of the data, reflecting the capability of the solution in addressing different\ntypes of challenges. [S38] 4. [S39] Reliability: The benchmark shall allow reliable assessment of metrics: the ground truths\nshall be accurate; the metrics shall well capture the performance of the model; the evaluation\nshall be easy and reliable, and the computed metrics shall hold statistical significance. [S40] 5. [S41] Longevity: Finally, to enable research and experimental comparison in a long term, the\nscenarios and the data in the benchmark shall not quickly expire and ideally shall be refreshed\nand improved over time. [S42] We strive to create a benchmark that have all of the aforementioned features, and we call it CRAG \u2013\nComprehensive benchmark for RAG. [S43] Our work makes three contributions. [S44] Our first contribution is the dataset itself (Section 3). [S45] CRAG contains a rich set of 4,409 QA pairs\nfrom five domains: Finance, Sports, Music, Movie, and Open domain. [S46] In addition to simple-fact\nquestions (asking for an attribute of an entity), CRAG contains seven types of complex questions to\ncover real user queries: questions with Conditions, Comparison questions, Aggregation questions,\nMulti-hop questions, Set queries, Post-processing-heavy questions, and False-premise questions. [S47] CRAG reflects varied entity popularity from popular to long-tail and temporal spans ranging from\nseconds to years, allowing easy deep dives for insights. [S48] As we generated the questions, we referred\nto smart assistant use cases to make sure the questions are realistic, paraphrased the questions to\nincrease the diversity of expressions, and manually verified ground truths to ensure reliability. [S49] In addition to QA pairs, CRAG provides mock APIs to simulate retrieval from a diverse range of\navailable information. [S50] This includes up to 50 full HTML pages for each question returned from a\nreal-world search engine\u2014the Brave Search API [5], and mock KGs with 2.6 million entities. [S51] For the\nmock KGs, we deliberately make sure that the retrieval candidates reflect noises in a realistic setting. [S52] Our second contribution is the evaluation mechanism to allow for reliable comparisons. [S53] We designed\n3 tasks to test different components in RAG solutions: retrieval summarization, knowledge graph\nand web retrieval, and end-to-end retrieval-augmented generation (Section 2). [S54] Instead of computing\nthe percentage of correctly answered questions, our score system distinguishes hallucinated answers\nand missing answers, and gives the former a higher penalty as it can be more harmful to ruin user\n\n2\n\nLLMWhat is the gold price today?Gold price is at $1626.81 per ounce today Oct 21 2022.Gold price is at $2020.8 per ounce today Jan 28 2024.DocumentsWeb SearchReal-time APIsKnowledge GraphRetrieved relevantknowledgeQuestion (a) LLM Direct Generation(b) RAG: Retrieved-Augmented Generation with LLM\fTable 1: Comparing CRAG to existing benchmarks for factual question answering.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which model had the highest truthfulness score in Task 3 of CRAG and what that indicates about its performance in complex RAG tasks.\n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant part of the supporting context. The passage mentions Table 11, which summarizes the results of straightforward RAG solutions. The question is about Task 3, so I should look at the columns related to Task 3. \n\nLooking at the data provided, the columns are labeled Task 1, Task 2, Task 3, and Task 4. Wait, the user specified Task 3, so I need to check the Task 3 column. The rows list various models like Llama 2 7B Chat, Llama 2 70B Chat, etc. \n\nThe truthfulness percentage for Task 3 is in the fourth row of the table. Let me check each model's truthfulness score. The last set of numbers under Task 3 for each model is the truthfulness percentage. For example, the first model, Llama 2 7B Chat, has 16.0, then 31.9, 32.1, 40.6, 22.0, 27.8, 33.5, and 43.6. Wait, no, looking again, the rows are split into four sections. The Task 3 column for each model is the fourth set of numbers. Let me parse this correctly.\n\nThe table structure seems a bit confusing. Each model has four sets of numbers corresponding to Task 1 to Task 4. For Task 3, the numbers are the third set. Let me check each model's Task 3 truthfulness:\n\n- Llama 2 7B Chat: 16.4 (Task 1), 16.4 (Task 2), 16.4 (Task 3)? Wait, no, the way the data is presented is a bit unclear. Let me look again.\n\nActually, the table has four tasks, and each model's performance is listed across these tasks. The rows are split into four sections, each with the same models. For example, the first section under \"Task 1\" has the accuracy percentages, then \"Task 2\" has the hallucination percentages, \"Task 3\" has the missing percentages, and \"Task 4\" has the truthfulness percentages. Wait, no, the headers are \"Accuracy (%)\", \"Hallucination (%)\", \"Missing (%)\", \"Truthfulness (%)\". So each model's row has four values corresponding to these metrics across the tasks. But the tasks are not labeled here. Wait, the table's title says \"Performance of straightforward RAG solutions on CRAG.\" The columns are labeled as Task 1, Task 2, Task 3, Task 4? Or are the columns the metrics?\n\nLooking at the passage: \"Table 11: Performance of straightforward RAG solutions on CRAG. [S935] Model Accuracy (%) Hallucination (%) Missing (%) Truthfulness (%)\". So the columns are the metrics, not the tasks. Wait, the user is asking about Task 3 of CRAG. But the table's columns are Accuracy, Hallucination, Missing, Truthfulness. Maybe the tasks are different. Wait, the passage mentions \"3 tasks to test different components in RAG solutions: retrieval summarization, knowledge graph and web retrieval, and end-to-end retrieval-augmented generation (Section 2).\" So Task 1, 2, 3 correspond to these three tasks. But the table's columns are Accuracy, Hallucination, Missing, Truthfulness. Maybe each task has these metrics. But the way the data is presented is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table's rows are the models, and each row has four values corresponding to the four tasks. But the headers are \"Accuracy (%), Hallucination (%), Missing (%), Truthfulness (%)\". So maybe each of these metrics is evaluated across the three tasks. But the user is asking about Task 3. This is a bit unclear. However, the user specifically mentions Task 3 of CRAG, which in the passage's context refers to the third task mentioned earlier, which is \"end-to-end retrieval-augmented generation.\"\n\nBut the table's structure isn't clear. However, looking at the numbers, the last column is Truthfulness (%). The user is asking for the highest truthfulness score in Task 3. If the table's columns are the metrics, then the Truthfulness column would have the scores for each model across the tasks. But without clear task labels, it's tricky. However, the user's question is about Task 3, so perhaps the third task's truthfulness score is in the third column? Or maybe the fourth column is for Task 3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the table's rows are split into four sections, each corresponding to a task. For example, the first set of models (Llama 2 7B Chat, etc.) under \"Task 1\" has accuracy percentages, then \"Task 2\" has hallucination, \"Task 3\" has missing, and \"Task 4\" has truthfulness. But that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, the table might have four tasks, each with their own metrics. However, the user's question is about Task 3, so I need to find the truthfulness score for that task. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the key is to look for the highest truthfulness score in the table. The last column is labeled \"Truthfulness (%)\", and the values there are: 83.6, 65.7, 56.3, 31.6, 56.6, 37.1, 44.1, 30.1. Wait, no, looking at the data:\n\nThe last set of numbers under \"Truthfulness (%)\" for each model:\n\nFor example, the last row is GPT-4 Turbo with 43.6 in the third column (Task 3?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the numbers in the last column (Truthfulness %), the highest value is 43.6 for GPT-4 Turbo. But I need to confirm which model that corresponds to. \n\nLooking at the data:\n\nThe last column (Truthfulness %) for each model:\n\n- Llama 2 7B Chat: 83.6\n- Llama 2 70B Chat: 65.7\n- Llama 3 8B Instruct: 56.3\n- Llama 3 70B Instruct: 31.6\n- Falcon 40B: 56.6\n- FLAN-T5-XXL 11B: 37.1\n- Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1: 44.1\n- GPT-4 Turbo: 30.1\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. The numbers are spread across the rows. Let me re-express the data properly. \n\nThe table's data is structured as follows:\n\nEach model has four rows of data. For example:\n\nFor Llama 2 7B Chat:\n- Task 1: 14.8 (Accuracy)\n- Task 2: 16.4 (Hallucination)\n- Task 3: 16.4 (Missing)\n- Task 4: 83.6 (Truthfulness)\n\nBut this is just a guess. Alternatively, the four columns are Accuracy, Hallucination, Missing, Truthfulness, and each model's row has four values corresponding to these metrics across the tasks. However, without clear labels, it's challenging. \n\nAlternatively, the table might have four tasks, each with their own metrics. But the user is asking about Task 3. Given the ambiguity, the best approach is to look for the highest truthfulness score in the table. The highest value in the Truthfulness column is 83.6, which is for Llama 2 7B Chat. However, this might be for a different task. \n\nBut the user specifically mentions Task 3. If the Truthfulness column corresponds to Task 3, then the highest is 83.6 for Llama 2 7B Chat. However, this seems high compared to other models. Alternatively, if the Truthfulness is for Task 4, but the user is asking about Task 3. \n\nThis is confusing. However, based on the data provided, the highest truthfulness score in the table is 83.6 for Llama 2 7B Chat. But I need to check the context again. \n\nIn the passage, the user mentions \"Task 3 of CRAG\". Earlier in the passage, it's stated that CRAG has three tasks: retrieval summarization, knowledge graph and web retrieval, and end-to-end retrieval-augmented generation. The table's columns are Accuracy, Hallucination, Missing, Truthfulness. \n\nAssuming that each task has these metrics, but the table's structure isn't clear. However, the user's question is about Task 3, which is end-to-end retrieval-augmented generation. If the Truthfulness metric for Task 3 is in the fourth column, then the highest value is 83.6 for Llama 2 7B Chat. However, this might not be accurate. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the numbers, the highest truthfulness score in the table is 83.6, which is under the \"Truthfulness (%)\" column for Llama 2 7B Chat. Therefore, the answer would be Llama 2 7B Chat with a truthfulness score of 83.6. However, this might be for a different task. \n\nBut given the information available, this is the best possible answer. The citation would be [S935] for the table. However, the exact sentence numbers might be different. The table is mentioned in [S935], so that's the citation."

      ],
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about how the accuracy of responses is evaluated in RAG solutions and the criteria for human evaluation. They want details from the evaluation rubric and scoring system.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage has two parts. Let me start with Passage 1. \n\nLooking at the sentences, there's a section labeled A.2 Evaluation, specifically A.2.1 Human evaluation. Sentence S799 mentions running human evaluation to score each answer based on metrics from Section 4.1. Then S800 talks about scoring perfect, acceptable, missing, or incorrect answers with specific scores (sp, sa, sm, sin) and defines truthfulnessh as the answer's score by setting sp=1, sa=0.5, sm=0, sin=-1. \n\nNext, S801 says they compute the average truthfulness for all examples as the truthfulness score. Then, S802 and S803 mention human-eval instructions. The instructions in S804-833 describe the criteria for accuracy. For example, Accuracy = 0 (Missing) when there's no response or failure to answer, like \"I can't find...\" (S805-S823). Accuracy = 1 (Incorrect) for unintelligible answers, major hallucinations, irrelevance, or structural errors (S824-S833). \n\nThere's also Table 10 (S829) with accuracy and F1 scores for models, but the question is about human evaluation criteria, so maybe that's less relevant. \n\nPassage 2 mentions auto-eval in Stage 1 and manual evaluation in Stage 2, but the user is asking about human evaluation criteria, so the main info is in Passage 1's A.2.1 section. \n\nSo, the answer should combine the scoring system (sp, sa, sm, sin) and the criteria for accuracy levels (missing, incorrect). Also, the truthfulness score is the average of these. The human evaluation instructions detail the accuracy criteria. \n\nI need to structure the answer with citations. Each sentence in the response should have the relevant citations. For example, explaining the scoring system would cite S799, S800. The accuracy criteria would cite S804-S833, but since each sentence is a separate statement, I need to check which specific sentences are relevant. \n\nWait, the user wants the answer synthesized from the evaluation rubric and scoring system. So the key points are:\n\n1. Human evaluation scores answers as perfect (sp), acceptable (sa), missing (sm), incorrect (sin) with specific values.\n2. Truthfulness is calculated using these scores.\n3. Accuracy criteria: Missing (no response, failure to answer), Incorrect (hallucinations, irrelevance, structural issues).\n\nEach of these points should be in separate statements with appropriate citations. For example, the scoring system is in S799 and S800. The accuracy criteria are detailed in S804-S833, but since each sentence is a separate statement, I need to check which sentences are directly relevant. \n\nLooking at S804: \"Using an external search engine, please evaluate the factual accuracy of the response according to the grading rubric below.\" Then the criteria for Accuracy = 0 (Missing) and Accuracy = 1 (Incorrect) are in S805-S833. However, the exact citations would be the sentences that define each criterion. For example, S805 says \"An accurate answer should be factually correct...\", but the specific criteria for missing and incorrect are in the subsequent sentences. \n\nBut the user wants the answer to cite the sentence numbers. So for the accuracy criteria, the relevant sentences are S805 (accuracy definition), S806 (covers situations), S807-S819 (examples of missing), S824 (incorrect), S825-S833 (criteria for incorrect). However, each of these would need to be cited. But since the answer needs to be concise, maybe group them. \n\nAlternatively, the main points are:\n\n- Human evaluation uses scores sp, sa, sm, sin (S799, S800)\n- Truthfulness is average of these (S801)\n- Accuracy criteria: Missing (S805-S823), Incorrect (S824-S833)\n\nBut the exact citations would be the sentences that define each part. So the answer would have statements citing those sentences."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the key components of prompts used in RAG solutions and how they differ across tasks, specifically looking at Vanilla LLM, web search, and KG-based prompts. They want a synthesis of information from the provided passages.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the supporting context given. The passages mention different prompts for various tasks. Let me look at Passage 2, which has detailed prompts for Vanilla LLM, web search (Task 1), and KG with web search (Tasks 2 and 3). There's also a query entity extraction prompt. \n\nStarting with the Vanilla LLM prompt. From S880 to S887, the prompt includes the question, query time, and guidelines. The key components here are the question, query time, and specific instructions like handling false premises and uncertainty. The user is told to answer concisely and use \"I don't know\" if unsure. So, the components are the question, query time, and guidelines.\n\nNext, the RAG with web search (Task 1) prompt. S888 to S896 adds references. The components here are the question, query time, references, and the same guidelines. The difference from Vanilla LLM is the inclusion of references, which are web search results. So the key components are question, query time, references, and guidelines.\n\nThen, the RAG with KG and web search (Tasks 2 and 3) prompt. S897 to S905 includes both web results and knowledge graph (KG) responses. The components here are the question, query time, references (web), KG responses, and the same guidelines. The addition of KG data is the main difference here compared to Task 1.\n\nThe query entity extraction prompt (S906-S914) is about extracting domain and structured info. The components here are the query, query time, domain determination, and structured information extraction. This seems like a preprocessing step to identify the domain and extract entities, which might be used in subsequent RAG steps.\n\nNow, how do these differ across tasks? The Vanilla LLM doesn't use any external data, just the question and time. Web search adds references (external data), and KG-based adds both web and KG data. The entity extraction is a separate step that might feed into these prompts.\n\nI need to make sure I'm citing the correct sentences. For example, the Vanilla LLM's components are in S880-S887. The web search includes S888-S896, and the KG part is S897-S905. The entity extraction is S906-S914.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned synthesizing information from all three (Vanilla, web, KG). So I need to highlight the common components (question, query time, guidelines) and the differences (references, KG, entity extraction).\n\nI should structure the answer by listing the key components for each prompt type and then explain the differences. Each statement should have the relevant citations. Let me check each part again to ensure accuracy."

[S82] Questions that compare two entities (e.g., \u201cwho started performing earlier, Adele or\nEd Sheeran?\u201d). [S83] Questions that require aggregation of retrieval results to answer (e.g., \u201chow many\nOscar awards did Meryl Streep win?\u201d). [S84] Questions that require chaining multiple pieces of information to compose the answer\n(e.g., \u201cwho acted in Ang Lee\u2019s latest movie?\u201d). [S85] Questions that need reasoning or processing of the retrieved information to obtain\nthe answer (e.g., \u201chow many days did Thurgood Marshall serve as a Supreme Court\njustice?\u201d). [S86] Questions that have a false preposition or assumption (e.g., \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of\nTaylor Swift\u2019s rap album before she transitioned to pop?\u201d (Taylor Swift has not yet\nreleased any rap album)). [S87] We designed three tasks. [S88] They share the same set of (question, answer) pairs but differ in the external\ndata accessible for retrieval to augment QA. [S89] Here, we provide the content that can be leveraged in\nQA to ensure fair comparisons. [S90] We describe how we generated the data in Section 3. [S91] Task 1: Retrieval Summarization. [S92] In Task 1, we provide up to five web pages for each question. [S93] These web pages are likely, but not guaranteed, to be relevant to the question. [S94] This task aims to test\nthe answer generation capability of a RAG system. [S95] Task 2: KG and Web Retrieval Augmentation. [S96] In Task 2, we in addition provide mock APIs to\naccess information from underlying mock KGs. [S97] The mock KGs store structured data relevant to the\nquestions; answers to the questions may or may not exist in the mock KGs. [S98] The mock APIs take\ninput parameters, oftentimes parsed from the question, and provide structured data from the mocked\nKGs to support answer generation. [S99] This task tests how well a RAG system 1) queries structured data\nsources and 2) synthesizes information from different sources. [S100] Task 3: End-to-end RAG. [S101] Similar to Task 2, Task 3 also provides both web search results and mock\nAPIs as candidates for retrieval but provides 50 web pages, instead of 5, as candidates. [S102] The larger set\nof web pages are more likely to provide necessary information to answer the question, but meanwhile\nare more likely to contain noises. [S103] As such, Task 3 in addition tests how a RAG system ranks a larger\nnumber of retrieval results. [S104] The three tasks, each adding upon the previous one, allow testing different capabilities of the RAG\nsystems. [S105] The only component of a RAG system not covered by these tasks is search retrieval.

[S739] After the initial round of QA pair generation, an\naudit session was conducted, where expert annotators reviewed the question template, questions,\nand meta-labels (domain, question type, etc), applying edits as necessary with 2x human review\n(agreement rate 90%`). [S740] All problematic questions (e.g., a wrong false-premise question) were\nrevised, and all conflicting labels were resolved by a third more experienced auditor. [S741] Phase 2. [S742] Answer validation. [S743] To ensure the answers in the benchmark are correct, we further\nconducted an auditing process for all the answers. [S744] For the web questions, an annotation team\nreviewed each question and conducted an extensive search to make sure the answer is factually\ncorrect and includes comprehensive information (such as for set questions) with 2x human review\n(agreement rate 90%`). [S745] A third more experienced auditor then reviewed all conflicting answers and\nprovided a resolution. [S746] For the KG questions, a team of five engineers carefully checked the questions\nand queried the mock APIs manually to validate the answers. [S747] This step resulted in a 5% answer\ncorrection. [S748] In both phases, we paid special attention to examples where the straightforward solutions output\ndifferent answers from the ground truth answers and asked the auditing team to double-check those\nexamples.

[S92] In Task 1, we provide up to five web pages for each question. [S93] These web pages are likely, but not guaranteed, to be relevant to the question. [S94] This task aims to test\nthe answer generation capability of a RAG system. [S95] Task 2: KG and Web Retrieval Augmentation. [S96] In Task 2, we in addition provide mock APIs to\naccess information from underlying mock KGs. [S97] The mock KGs store structured data relevant to the\nquestions; answers to the questions may or may not exist in the mock KGs. [S98] The mock APIs take\ninput parameters, oftentimes parsed from the question, and provide structured data from the mocked\nKGs to support answer generation.

[S103] As such, Task 3 in addition tests how a RAG system ranks a larger\nnumber of retrieval results. [S104] The three tasks, each adding upon the previous one, allow testing different capabilities of the RAG\nsystems.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the primary purpose of Task 3: End-to-end RAG and how it differs from Task 1 and Task 2 in terms of retrieval challenges.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions three tasks: Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3. Let me find the relevant sections.\n\nLooking at the passage, Task 3 is mentioned in sentences S100 to S103. Specifically, S100 says \"Task 3: End-to-end RAG.\" Then S101 states that Task 3 provides both web search results and mock APIs but with 50 web pages instead of 5. S102 mentions that the larger set of web pages is more likely to have necessary info but also more noise. S103 says Task 3 tests how a RAG system ranks a larger number of retrieval results.\n\nFor the purpose of Task 3, the key points are the increased number of web pages (50 vs. 5 in Task 1) and the focus on ranking more results, which introduces more noise. The retrieval challenges here are handling a larger, noisier dataset compared to Tasks 1 and 2.\n\nNow, comparing to Task 1 and Task 2. Task 1 (S92) provides up to five web pages, focusing on answer generation. Task 2 (S95) adds mock APIs for structured data. Task 3 builds on Task 2 by increasing the number of web pages and emphasizing ranking amidst more noise. So the main difference is the scale and complexity of retrieval, with Task 3 being more challenging due to the larger dataset and need for better ranking.\n\nI need to make sure the citations are correct. The relevant sentences are S100, S101, S102, S103 for Task 3's purpose and differences. For Task 1 and 2, S92, S95, S96, S97, S98, S99. But the question is about how Task 3 differs, so the citations should be from the parts where Task 3 is described and compared.\n\nSo the answer should state that Task 3's primary purpose is to test ranking in a larger, noisier retrieval set, differing from Tasks 1 and 2 which have fewer web pages and focus on different aspects like structured data access."

[S739] After the initial round of QA pair generation, an\naudit session was conducted, where expert annotators reviewed the question template, questions,\nand meta-labels (domain, question type, etc), applying edits as necessary with 2x human review\n(agreement rate 90%`). [S740] All problematic questions (e.g., a wrong false-premise question) were\nrevised, and all conflicting labels were resolved by a third more experienced auditor. [S741] Phase 2. [S742] Answer validation. [S743] To ensure the answers in the benchmark are correct, we further\nconducted an auditing process for all the answers. [S744] For the web questions, an annotation team\nreviewed each question and conducted an extensive search to make sure the answer is factually\ncorrect and includes comprehensive information (such as for set questions) with 2x human review\n(agreement rate 90%`). [S745] A third more experienced auditor then reviewed all conflicting answers and\nprovided a resolution. [S746] For the KG questions, a team of five engineers carefully checked the questions\nand queried the mock APIs manually to validate the answers. [S747] This step resulted in a 5% answer\ncorrection. [S748] In both phases, we paid special attention to examples where the straightforward solutions output\ndifferent answers from the ground truth answers and asked the auditing team to double-check those\nexamples.

[S87] We designed three tasks. [S88] They share the same set of (question, answer) pairs but differ in the external\ndata accessible for retrieval to augment QA. [S89] Here, we provide the content that can be leveraged in\nQA to ensure fair comparisons. [S90] We describe how we generated the data in Section 3. [S91] Task 1: Retrieval Summarization. [S92] In Task 1, we provide up to five web pages for each question. [S93] These web pages are likely, but not guaranteed, to be relevant to the question. [S94] This task aims to test\nthe answer generation capability of a RAG system. [S95] Task 2: KG and Web Retrieval Augmentation. [S96] In Task 2, we in addition provide mock APIs to\naccess information from underlying mock KGs. [S97] The mock KGs store structured data relevant to the\nquestions; answers to the questions may or may not exist in the mock KGs. [S98] The mock APIs take\ninput parameters, oftentimes parsed from the question, and provide structured data from the mocked\nKGs to support answer generation. [S99] This task tests how well a RAG system 1) queries structured data\nsources and 2) synthesizes information from different sources. [S100] Task 3: End-to-end RAG. [S101] Similar to Task 2, Task 3 also provides both web search results and mock\nAPIs as candidates for retrieval but provides 50 web pages, instead of 5, as candidates. [S102] The larger set\nof web pages are more likely to provide necessary information to answer the question, but meanwhile\nare more likely to contain noises. [S103] As such, Task 3 in addition tests how a RAG system ranks a larger\nnumber of retrieval results. [S104] The three tasks, each adding upon the previous one, allow testing different capabilities of the RAG\nsystems. [S105] The only component of a RAG system not covered by these tasks is search retrieval.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the differences between 'Real-time' and 'Fast-changing' questions according to the dynamism categories, and which domains have the highest concentration of Real-time questions.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions Table 3 and Table 7. Let me check those sections. \n\nIn Passage 1, there's a mention of Table 3, which lists the numbers and percentages of questions for each dynamism category. The sentence [S111] says, \"Finance and Sports domain have the most Real-time and Fast-changing questions.\" So that's a key point for the second part of the question.\n\nThen, looking at Passage 2, specifically Table 7 under \"A.1.3 Constructing QA pairs from web contents,\" there's a definition of dynamism categories. The entries are:\n\n- Real-time: Answer changes over seconds (e.g., \"What\u2019s Costco\u2019s stock price today?\").\n- Fast-changing: Answer changes no more than daily (e.g., \"When is Laker\u2019s game tonight?\").\n- Slow-changing: Changes no more than yearly.\n- Static: Doesn't change over time.\n\nSo the distinction is based on how frequently the answer changes. Real-time is every second, Fast-changing daily. \n\nThe user also asked which domains have the highest concentration of Real-time questions. From [S111], it's Finance and Sports. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions. The rest of the context talks about tasks, data generation, validation, etc., but the key info is in Table 3 and Table 7. \n\nSo the answer should state that Real-time questions change every second, Fast-changing daily, and Finance and Sports have the most Real-time questions. Citations would be [S111] for the domains and [S723]-[S726] for the definitions. Wait, the definitions are in Passage 2, S723 to S726. Let me check the exact sentences.\n\nIn Passage 2, [S723] starts the definition table. The entries are:\n\n[S723] Dynamism\n\n[S724] Real-time: answer changes over seconds...\n\n[S725] Fast-changing: changes no more than daily...\n\n[S726] Slow-changing: no more than yearly...\n\nSo the citations for the definitions would be [S723][S724][S725][S726]. But each sentence in the answer should have its own citations. \n\nThe first part of the answer about the distinction would cite [S724] and [S725]. The second part about domains cites [S111]. \n\nI need to structure the statements properly. Each statement is a separate <statement> with citations. So:\n\nFirst statement: \"According to the dynamism categories, 'Real-time' questions are distinguished by answers that change over seconds, while 'Fast-changing' questions have answers that change no more than daily.\" Citations [S724][S725].\n\nSecond statement: \"The Finance and Sports domains have the highest concentration of Real-time questions.\" Citation [S111].\n\nCheck if there's any other info. The user didn't ask about other domains, so that's sufficient."

[S97] The mock KGs store structured data relevant to the\nquestions; answers to the questions may or may not exist in the mock KGs. [S98] The mock APIs take\ninput parameters, oftentimes parsed from the question, and provide structured data from the mocked\nKGs to support answer generation. [S99] This task tests how well a RAG system 1) queries structured data\nsources and 2) synthesizes information from different sources. [S100] Task 3: End-to-end RAG. [S101] Similar to Task 2, Task 3 also provides both web search results and mock\nAPIs as candidates for retrieval but provides 50 web pages, instead of 5, as candidates. [S102] The larger set\nof web pages are more likely to provide necessary information to answer the question, but meanwhile\nare more likely to contain noises. [S103] As such, Task 3 in addition tests how a RAG system ranks a larger\nnumber of retrieval results. [S104] The three tasks, each adding upon the previous one, allow testing different capabilities of the RAG\nsystems. [S105] The only component of a RAG system not covered by these tasks is search retrieval. [S106] One\nmay easily extend the tasks to use all 220K webpages in our benchmark as the search corpus for fully\nend-to-end testing.

        "[S715] We created the Comparison, Aggregation, Set, Post-processing, and False-premise questions in a\nsimilar way but 1) made sure the template allows for crisp and deterministic answers and 2) sampled\nthe subject entities that fit the question. [S716] We used heuristics to select entity types for these question\ncategories. [S717] Finally, we created multi-hop questions in three steps, similar to those described in [31]. [S718] We first\nsampled an entity e1 from the KG and selected two relation triplets following a two-hop path:\npe1, r1, e2q and pe1, r2, e3q. [S719] We then created a question template describing the path. [S720] For example,\nfor path (company1, is_parent, company2) followed by (company1, ceo, person), we created the\ntemplate \"who is the CEO of the parent company of [company2]?\".

[S728] Ask annotators to write down a list of questions that could possibly be answered by web\nsearch based on a general guideline (e.g., \u201cwhat is the most popular action movie in 2023?\u201d). [S729] Step 2. [S730] Generate the web search results to answer the question. [S731] Step 3. [S732] Finally, annotators reviewed the web search results to determine the ground truth answers to\nthe questions: 1) If the search results successfully provided the necessary information, annotators\nrecorded the ground truth answer text and the URL associated with it based on the retrieved content. [S733] Note that the answer is determined by the query_time at which the web search happened, especially\nfor the Fast-changing and Real-time questions. [S734] 2) Otherwise, annotators conducted further web\nsearches to document the correct answers. [S735] 13\n\n\fBesides the QA pairs, the annotators will also provide labels for the domain, dynamism, question\ntypes, and an answer URL (a URL that contains the answer to the question) for Web Questions. [S736] A.1.4 Validation for the QA pairs\n\nWe conducted two phases of dataset validation with our in-house Linguist team. [S737] Phase 1. [S738] Question and meta-label validation. [S739] After the initial round of QA pair generation, an\naudit session was conducted, where expert annotators reviewed the question template, questions,\nand meta-labels (domain, question type, etc), applying edits as necessary with 2x human review\n(agreement rate 90%`). [S740] All problematic questions (e.g., a wrong false-premise question) were\nrevised, and all conflicting labels were resolved by a third more experienced auditor. [S741] Phase 2. [S742] Answer validation. [S743] To ensure the answers in the benchmark are correct, we further\nconducted an auditing process for all the answers. [S744] For the web questions, an annotation team\nreviewed each question and conducted an extensive search to make sure the answer is factually\ncorrect and includes comprehensive information (such as for set questions) with 2x human review\n(agreement rate 90%`). [S745] A third more experienced auditor then reviewed all conflicting answers and\nprovided a resolution. [S746] For the KG questions, a team of five engineers carefully checked the questions\nand queried the mock APIs manually to validate the answers. [S747] This step resulted in a 5% answer\ncorrection. [S748] In both phases, we paid special attention to examples where the straightforward solutions output\ndifferent answers from the ground truth answers and asked the auditing team to double-check those\nexamples.

The user is asking about how the QA pairs were validated in Phase 1 and Phase 2, and the outcome of the answer validation for KG questions.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions two phases of validation. Let me scan through the text again. \n\nIn Passage 2, there's a section labeled \"A.1.4 Validation for the QA pairs\" starting at [S737]. It says they conducted two phases with their linguist team. \n\nPhase 1 is described as \"Question and meta-label validation.\" The details mention an audit session where expert annotators reviewed the question templates, questions, and meta-labels like domain and question type. They did 2x human review with a 90% agreement rate. Problematic questions were revised, and conflicting labels were resolved by a third auditor. That's from [S737] to [S741].\n\nPhase 2 is \"Answer validation.\" For web questions, an annotation team reviewed each question and did extensive searches to ensure answers were factually correct, with 2x review. A third auditor handled conflicts. For KG questions, five engineers checked the questions and manually queried mock APIs. This resulted in a 5% answer correction. Also, they focused on cases where straightforward solutions differed from ground truth, leading to an additional 2% updates. This is covered in [S742] to [S750].\n\nSo, the answer should outline Phase 1 and Phase 2 validations, citing the relevant sentences. For KG questions, the outcome was a 5% correction rate. The user also asked about the outcome of the answer validation process for KG questions, which is mentioned in [S747] and [S748].\n\nI need to structure the response with statements and citations. Each sentence should be in <statement> tags with citations. Let me check the exact sentences again to make sure I get the right citations. \n\nFor Phase 1: [S737]-[S741] cover the first phase. Phase 2: [S742]-[S746] for web questions and [S747]-[S748] for KG. The 5% correction is in [S747] and [S748]. Also, the additional 2% is in [S749]-[S750], but the question specifically asks about KG questions, so maybe focus on the 5% part.\n\nI need to make sure each statement is correctly cited.

[S724] Fast-changing\n\nThe answer to the question changes no more than daily\n(e.g., \u201cWhen is Laker\u2019s game tonight?\u201d). [S725] Slow-changing\n\nThe answer to the question changes no more than yearly\n(e.g., \u201cWho won the Grammy award last year?\u201d). [S726] Static\n\nThe answer to the question does not change over time,\nsuch as the birth date of a person. [S727] A.1.3 Constructing QA pairs from web contents\n\nStep 1. [S728] Ask annotators to write down a list of questions that could possibly be answered by web\nsearch based on a general guideline (e.g., \u201cwhat is the most popular action movie in 2023?\u201d). [S729] Step 2. [S730] Generate the web search results to answer the question. [S731] Step 3. [S732] Finally, annotators reviewed the web search results to determine the ground truth answers to\nthe questions: 1) If the search results successfully provided the necessary information, annotators\nrecorded the ground truth answer text and the URL associated with it based on the retrieved content. [S733] Note that the answer is determined by the query_time at which the web search happened, especially\nfor the Fast-changing and Real-time questions. [S734] 2) Otherwise, annotators conducted further web\nsearches to document the correct answers. [S735] 13\n\n\fBesides the QA pairs, the annotators will also provide labels for the domain, dynamism, question\ntypes, and an answer URL (a URL that contains the answer to the question) for Web Questions. [S736] A.1.4 Validation for the QA pairs\n\nWe conducted two phases of dataset validation with our in-house Linguist team. [S737] Phase 1. [S738] Question and meta-label validation. [S739] After the initial round of QA pair generation, an\naudit session was conducted, where expert annotators reviewed the question template, questions,\nand meta-labels (domain, question type, etc), applying edits as necessary with 2x human review\n(agreement rate 90%`). [S740] All problematic questions (e.g., a wrong false-premise question) were\nrevised, and all conflicting labels were resolved by a third more experienced auditor. [S741] Phase 2. [S742] Answer validation. [S743] To ensure the answers in the benchmark are correct, we further\nconducted an auditing process for all the answers. [S744] For the web questions, an annotation team\nreviewed each question and conducted an extensive search to make sure the answer is factually\ncorrect and includes comprehensive information (such as for set questions) with 2x human review\n(agreement rate 90%`). [S745] A third more experienced auditor then reviewed all conflicting answers and\nprovided a resolution. [S746] For the KG questions, a team of five engineers carefully checked the questions\nand queried the mock APIs manually to validate the answers. [S747] This step resulted in a 5% answer\ncorrection. [S748] In both phases, we paid special attention to examples where the straightforward solutions output\ndifferent answers from the ground truth answers and asked the auditing team to double-check those\nexamples. [S749] This step yielded an additional 2% answer updates. [S750] A.1.5 An example of retrieved web search results\n\nKey"

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the role of mock APIs in Task 2: KG and Web Retrieval Augmentation, and what types of information they provide.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions Task 2 in several sentences. Let me scan through the sentences again to find the relevant parts.\n\nLooking at the passage, specifically sentences S95 to S100. S95 says \"Task 2: KG and Web Retrieval Augmentation.\" Then S96 mentions \"mock APIs to access information from underlying mock KGs.\" S97 states that the mock KGs store structured data relevant to the questions. S98 explains that the mock APIs take input parameters, often parsed from the question, and provide structured data from the mocked KGs. S99 says this task tests how well a RAG system queries structured data sources and synthesizes information from different sources.\n\nSo, the role of mock APIs in Task 2 is to provide access to structured data from mock KGs. The information they provide is structured data relevant to the questions, which can be used to support answer generation. The APIs take parameters from the questions and retrieve that structured data. \n\nI need to make sure I'm citing the correct sentences. The key sentences are S96, S97, S98, and S99. Let me check again. \n\nYes, S96 mentions the mock APIs, S97 talks about the structured data in mock KGs, S98 explains how the APIs work, and S99 describes the purpose of the task. \n\nSo the answer should state that mock APIs in Task 2 provide access to structured data from mock KGs, which includes information relevant to the questions. They take input parameters from the questions and supply this structured data to help generate answers. The role is to test the RAG system's ability to query structured data and combine information from different sources."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the experimental setup used to evaluate LLM-only and RAG solutions on CRAG and how the context window sizes varied across different models.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The main passage here is Passage 2, as it discusses the experiment setup. Let me scan through the sentences in Passage 2.\n\nLooking at sentence [S180], it mentions that in the section, they present the performance of LLMs and RAG systems on CRAG. Then, in [S181], there's an experiment setup description. It says they ran LLM-only solutions on the CRAG public test set with 1,335 questions using simple prompts. They also list the models used: Llama 2 Chat, Llama 3 Instruct, Mixtral, Falcon, FLAN-T5, and GPT-4 Turbo. \n\nNext, [S182] talks about web-only RAG solutions (Task 1) using a fixed-length web context window. The sizes are 1K for Falcon and FLAN-T5, 2K for Llama 2 Chat, and 4K for Llama 3 Instruct and GPT-4 Turbo. They concatenated webpage snippets in order until the window was filled. \n\nThen [S183] discusses KG-based solutions (Tasks 2, 3) with a fixed-length KG context window. The sizes here are 0.5K for Falcon and FLAN-T5, 1K for Llama 2 Chat, and 2K for Llama 3 Instruct and GPT-4 Turbo. They used mock APIs and extracted entities with llama-3-8B-instruct. \n\nSo, the experimental setup involved different models for LLM-only and RAG tasks, with varying context window sizes. The answer should mention the models used for LLM-only, the different context window sizes for web-only RAG and KG-based solutions, and the specific models associated with each window size.\n\nI need to make sure to cite the correct sentences. The setup is in [S181], the web context windows in [S182], and the KG context windows in [S183]. Also, the mention of LLM-only solutions is in [S181] and [S182]. \n\nI should structure the answer to first state the experimental setup, then detail the context window variations. Each part should have the appropriate citations. Let me check if there's any other relevant info. The models listed in [S181] are part of the LLM-only setup. The RAG solutions have different context windows as per [S182] and [S183]. \n\nYes, that should cover it. Now, formulating the statements with citations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the highest accuracy rates from LLM-only and straightforward RAG solutions according to Table 5, and how they compare across tasks.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the supporting context provided. The relevant part is in Passage 2, specifically Table 5. The passage mentions that Table 5 shows the performance of straightforward RAG solutions. \n\nLooking at the text, there's a sentence that says: \"LLM-only solutions has up to 34% accuracy and straightforward RAG solutions has up to 44% accuracy.\" That's from [S187]. So the highest accuracy for LLM-only is 34%, and for RAG it's 44%. \n\nNow, the question also asks how these compare across tasks. The table in the passage (Table 5) probably breaks down the accuracy by tasks. However, the exact details of the tasks aren't in the provided text. But the user's question is about the highest rates, so the key numbers are 34% and 44%. \n\nI need to check if there are other sentences that mention specific tasks. The passage mentions Task 1, Task 2, Task 3 in the context of the experiments. For example, under \"Straightforward RAG solutions,\" they talk about Task 1 (web-only RAG), Task 2 (KG-based), and Task 3 (another task). However, the exact accuracy numbers per task aren't provided in the given text. The table's description says \"up to 34% accuracy\" for LLM-only and \"up to 44% for RAG,\" but without the full table, I can only rely on the given text. \n\nSo the answer should state the highest accuracies as 34% for LLM-only and 44% for RAG, citing [S187]. Since the comparison across tasks isn't detailed in the provided context, maybe the answer can mention that the table shows these maximums but the specific task comparisons aren't detailed here. However, the user might expect that the answer is based solely on the given text. \n\nTherefore, the answer is based on the sentence in [S187], and there's no further citation needed. The comparison across tasks isn't elaborated in the provided context, so the answer focuses on the highest rates mentioned."

[S117] The question types are listed in Table 2. [S118] We constructed the question-answer\npairs both from underlying KGs and web contents. [S119] QA pairs constructed from KGs. [S120] We constructed QA pairs from KGs by collecting a set of entities\nbased on publicly available data and then creating 600+ question templates based on selected entity\ntypes and relations. [S121] Next, we sampled entities with different popularities (head, torso and tail)\nfollowing [29] from the KGs to fill in the templates and generate the full question and answer. [S122] QA pairs constructed from web contents. [S123] We asked annotators to write down possible questions\nthat users may ask (e.g., \u201cmost popular action movies in 2023\u201d) and created QA pairs from the\ncorresponding web search results. [S124] Using the above methods, we collected 2,425 Web Questions and 1,984 KG Questions, with 661, 658,\nand 665 KG Questions containing head, torso, and tail entities respectively. [S125] Tables 3 and 4 summarize\nthe distribution of the questions across different dimensions. [S126] The size of each dimension slice (e.g.,\nfast-changing facts) allows us to get metrics with \u0103 5% margin-of-error (with 95% confidence level)\nfor most of the cases. [S127] The dynamism distribution roughly reflects the nature of the domain (e.g.,\nmuch more real-time questions for Finance than for other domains). [S128] See Appendix A.1.2 for the\ndefinition of the dynamism categories. [S129] 3.2 Contents for retrieval\n\nWe included two types of contents for retrieval to simulate the practical scenario for RAG: web search\nand KG search. [S130] Web search results. [S131] For each question, we used the question text as the search query and stored up\nto 50 HTML pages from the Brave search API [5]. [S132] See Table 8 in Appendix A.1.5 for an example. [S133] We estimated the web search recall with a heuristic-based method: first check whether the ground\ntruth answer URL was found among the pages; if not, decide whether the fact in the ground truths is\ncontained in the page snippet or content with an LLM. [S134] In particular, we pass the question, ground\ntruth, and the pages to Llama 3 70B Instruct and ask it to judge if the context is sufficient to answer\nthe question. [S135] 5\n\n\fFigure 2: For 85% of CRAG questions, the web search results are estimated to contain the ground\ntruth facts. [S136] The curve shows that the retrieval recall grows sharply at the beginning and flattens out\nlater on. [S137] Figure 2 shows the estimated web search recall curve for all CRAG questions, with an overall recall\nof 85% when using all 50 pages. [S138] It reflects multiple advantages of the benchmark by design. [S139] First,\nthe recall curves are sharp at the beginning and flatten out later, and the recall for the top 5 pages is\nabout 69%. [S140] This is comparable to what we observe in practice when developing a RAG system. [S141] The\nnon-perfect coverage, especially for Task 1, allows us to test whether the RAG solutions admit \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know\u201d when the retrieval results do not contain the necessary information. [S142] Second, compared\nto the recall from web snippets, full web pages increase the recall by about 20%, emphasizing the\nimportance of extracting and understanding HTML contents. [S143] Moreover, the estimated web search\nrecall (50 web pages) is 93% for Web Questions and 74% for KG Questions, indicating significantly\nlower recall for KG questions than web questions. [S144] This aligns with our observations that web search\nrecall for torso and tail entities is typically lower, underlining the crucial role of leveraging KGs in\nTask 2 and 3.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the design decision regarding the evaluation of first-stage retrieval candidate pool construction in the CRAG benchmark and how it relates to the dataset's construction methodology.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The main passage here is Passage 1, which has several sentences. Let me scan through them. \n\nLooking at sentence S950: \"The three tasks in our benchmark do not directly evaluate the construction of a first-stage retrieval candidate pool, a demanding retrieval task in its own right.\" That seems relevant. Then S951 says, \"This design decision ensures that the competition remains both challenging and achievable within the KDD Cup\u2019s required three-month timeframe.\" So the design decision was not to directly evaluate the first-stage retrieval candidate pool construction. \n\nThen, how does this relate to the dataset's construction? The next sentence, S952, mentions that users can use the union of all 220K web pages as a corpus to build a retriever. So even though the tasks don't directly evaluate the candidate pool construction, the dataset provides a large corpus for that purpose. \n\nThe dataset's construction methodology includes creating QA pairs from KGs and web contents, as mentioned in Passage 2. But the specific design decision about not evaluating the first-stage retrieval directly is in Passage 1. \n\nSo the answer should state that the design decision was not to directly evaluate the first-stage retrieval candidate pool construction, allowing the competition to be manageable. The dataset's construction provides a large corpus (220K web pages) for users to build their own retrievers, even though the tasks don't focus on that. \n\nCitations would be S950 and S951 for the design decision, and S952 for the dataset's relation. Wait, the question asks how the design decision relates to the dataset's construction. The dataset's construction allows users to build a retriever using the provided corpus, which is mentioned in S952. So the relation is that even though the tasks don't evaluate the candidate pool, the dataset provides the necessary data for that purpose."

[S117] The question types are listed in Table 2. [S118] We constructed the question-answer\npairs both from underlying KGs and web contents. [S119] QA pairs constructed from KGs. [S120] We constructed QA pairs from KGs by collecting a set of entities\nbased on publicly available data and then creating 600+ question templates based on selected entity\ntypes and relations. [S121] Next, we sampled entities with different popularities (head, torso and tail)\nfollowing [29] from the KGs to fill in the templates and generate the full question and answer. [S122] QA pairs constructed from web contents. [S123] We asked annotators to write down possible questions\nthat users may ask (e.g., \u201cmost popular action movies in 2023\u201d) and created QA pairs from the\ncorresponding web search results. [S124] Using the above methods, we collected 2,425 Web Questions and 1,984 KG Questions, with 661, 658,\nand 665 KG Questions containing head, torso, and tail entities respectively. [S125] Tables 3 and 4 summarize\nthe distribution of the questions across different dimensions.

[S127] The dynamism distribution roughly reflects the nature of the domain (e.g.,\nmuch more real-time questions for Finance than for other domains). [S128] See Appendix A.1.2 for the\ndefinition of the dynamism categories. [S129] 3.2 Contents for retrieval\n\nWe included two types of contents for retrieval to simulate the practical scenario for RAG: web search\nand KG search. [S130] Web search results. [S131] For each question, we used the question text as the search query and stored up\nto 50 HTML pages from the Brave search API [5]. [S132] See Table 8 in Appendix A.1.5 for an example. [S133] We estimated the web search recall with a heuristic-based method: first check whether the ground\ntruth answer URL was found among the pages; if not, decide whether the fact in the ground truths is\ncontained in the page snippet or content with an LLM. [S134] In particular, we pass the question, ground\ntruth, and the pages to Llama 3 70B Instruct and ask it to judge if the context is sufficient to answer\nthe question. [S135] 5\n\n\fFigure 2: For 85% of CRAG questions, the web search results are estimated to contain the ground\ntruth facts. [S136] The curve shows that the retrieval recall grows sharply at the beginning and flattens out\nlater on. [S137] Figure 2 shows the estimated web search recall curve for all CRAG questions, with an overall recall\nof 85% when using all 50 pages. [S138] It reflects multiple advantages of the benchmark by design. [S139] First,\nthe recall curves are sharp at the beginning and flatten out later, and the recall for the top 5 pages is\nabout 69%. [S140] This is comparable to what we observe in practice when developing a RAG system. [S141] The\nnon-perfect coverage, especially for Task 1, allows us to test whether the RAG solutions admit \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know\u201d when the retrieval results do not contain the necessary information. [S142] Second, compared\nto the recall from web snippets, full web pages increase the recall by about 20%, emphasizing the\nimportance of extracting and understanding HTML contents. [S143] Moreover, the estimated web search\nrecall (50 web pages) is 93% for Web Questions and 74% for KG Questions, indicating significantly\nlower recall for KG questions than web questions. [S144] This aligns with our observations that web search\nrecall for torso and tail entities is typically lower, underlining the crucial role of leveraging KGs in\nTask 2 and 3."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the difference in latency measurement between Perplexity.ai's API calls and web interface interactions, and the steps taken to ensure fair comparisons across systems.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The relevant part is in Passage 1, specifically from sentences S945 to S949. Let me check those.\n\nSentence S945 mentions that latency was measured as the time difference between query submission and response receipt. Then S946 states that Perplexity.ai's API latency is 2,455ms. Next, S947 says that API and web interface latencies aren't directly comparable, so they called Perplexity.ai via the web interface and reported that latency in Table 6. S948 notes that this web interface latency might not match the API accuracy numbers. S949 mentions that for Meta SG, they excluded on-device components to make their latency comparable to web interfaces.\n\nSo, the key points are: API latency is 2,455ms, but web interface latency is different and not directly comparable. They measured both but adjusted Meta SG's latency by removing on-device components. The steps for fairness include excluding on-device components and measuring both methods even though they aren't directly comparable.\n\nI need to structure the answer with these points, citing the relevant sentences. Make sure each statement has the correct citations. Also, check if there are other sentences that might be relevant. For example, S942 mentions the dates of calls, but that's about scheduling, not latency. S943 and S944 talk about settings, which might not be directly relevant here. So the main citations are S945, S946, S947, S948, S949.\n\nNow, form the statements. The first part answers how latency differs: API is 2,455ms, web is different and not directly comparable. Then the steps taken: excluding on-device components for fair comparison. Also, measuring both methods but noting the incompatibility.\n\nCheck for any other sentences. S949 specifically mentions excluding on-device components for Meta SG, which is part of ensuring fair comparison. So that's another citation. Also, S941 mentions excluding on-device components for Meta SG, but that's in the context of answer quality. Wait, S941 says they excluded on-device components to ensure answer quality wasn't affected. But S949 talks about estimating latency by excluding those components. So maybe both S941 and S949 are relevant for the steps taken. Wait, the question is about steps to ensure fair comparisons across systems. So S941 and S949 both mention excluding on-device components. But S941 is about answer quality, while S949 is about latency. So maybe S949 is the one directly related to latency. But the user is asking about steps taken to ensure fair comparisons, which includes both answer quality and latency. So perhaps both sentences are relevant. However, the user's question is specifically about latency measurement differences and steps for fair comparisons. So the steps would include excluding on-device components for Meta SG's latency, as per S949. Also, the fact that they measured both API and web interface for Perplexity.ai, even though they aren't directly comparable. \n\nSo the answer should mention that Perplexity.ai's API latency is 2,455ms, but web interface latency is different and not directly comparable. They measured both but noted the discrepancy. For fair comparison, they excluded on-device components (like ASR and TTS) in Meta SG to make its latency comparable to web interfaces. \n\nTherefore, the citations would be S946 for the API latency, S947 and S948 for the difference between API and web, and S949 for the steps taken with Meta SG. Also, S941 might be relevant for excluding components, but the exact context of S941 is about answer quality, not latency. So maybe only S949 is needed for the steps. But the user's question is about steps to ensure fair comparisons across systems. The passage mentions in S941 that they excluded on-device components to ensure answer quality wasn't affected. However, in S949, they adjusted Meta SG's latency by excluding those components. So both sentences might be part of the steps. But the question is about latency measurement, so S949 is more directly relevant. \n\nSo the final answer would have statements citing S945 (definition of latency), S946 (API latency), S947 (difference between API and web), S949 (steps for fair comparison). Also, S948 mentions that web latency may not correspond to API accuracy, which is part of the difference. \n\nI need to structure each sentence properly with citations. Let me draft the statements:\n\n1. Latency for Perplexity.ai via API is 2,455ms. [S946]\n2. Latency measured via API and web interface are not directly comparable, so they measured both. [S947][S948]\n3. To ensure fair comparison, on-device components were excluded for Meta SG's latency. [S949]\n\nBut need to check if the sentences are correctly attributed. Also, the first statement about the difference between API and web would be covered in S947 and S948. Maybe split into two sentences. Also, the definition of latency is in S945, which might be needed to explain how it's measured.\n\nSo:\n\n- \"The latency for Perplexity.ai measured via API call is 2,455ms.\" [S946]\n- \"Latency measured by API call and web interface interactions are not directly comparable, so Perplexity.ai was also called through its web interface, with the results reported in Table 6.\" [S947]\n- \"The web interface latency may not correspond to the accuracy numbers from API calls.\" [S948]\n- \"To ensure fair comparisons, on-device components like ASR and TTS were excluded for Meta SG to make its latency comparable to web interface interactions.\" [S949]\n\nBut the user's question also asks about steps taken to ensure fair comparisons across systems. The passage mentions in S941 that they excluded on-device components to ensure answer quality wasn't affected. However, S949 specifically mentions excluding them for latency. So maybe both S941 and S949 are relevant. But the question is about latency measurement steps. So S949 is the key one. However, the user might need to know that excluding components was part of the steps. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could combine the steps as excluding on-device components (S941 and S949). But since S941 is about answer quality, and S949 is about latency, maybe only S949 is cited for the steps related to latency. \n\nSo final answer would have:\n\n<statement>The latency for Perplexity.ai measured via API call is 2,455ms.<cite>[S946]</cite></statement>\n<statement>Latency measured by API call and web interface interactions are not directly comparable, so Perplexity.ai was also called through its web interface, with the results reported in Table 6.<cite>[S947]</cite></statement>\n<statement>The web interface latency may not correspond to the accuracy numbers from API calls.<cite>[S948]</cite></statement>\n<statement>To ensure fair comparisons, on-device components such as ASR and TTS were excluded for Meta SG to make its latency comparable to web interface interactions.<cite>[S949]</cite></statement>\n\nThat should cover the differences in latency measurement and the steps taken for fair comparisons."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the significance of including both web search and KG search contents in the CRAG retrieval tasks and how this affects the evaluation of RAG systems.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage mentions that CRAG includes two types of contents for retrieval: web search and KG search. The relevant sentences are in Passage 2, specifically [S129] and [S130]. \n\nLooking at [S130], it states that including both types simulates practical scenarios for RAG. That's probably a key point. Then, in [S131]-[S135], there's discussion about web search results and how they're used. But the user is asking about the significance of including both, so I need to find where the impact on evaluation is discussed.\n\nIn [S139]-[S144], there's a detailed analysis. For example, [S139] mentions that the recall curves are sharp initially and flatten, which is comparable to real RAG development. [S141] talks about testing if RAG solutions can say \"I don't know\" when needed. [S142] notes that full web pages increase recall by 20%, highlighting the importance of HTML content. [S144] points out lower recall for KG questions, emphasizing the need for KGs in certain tasks.\n\nSo the significance is that combining both allows for a more realistic evaluation, tests handling of incomplete data, and highlights the importance of different retrieval methods. The impact on evaluation is that it checks if systems can manage when retrieval fails and emphasizes the role of KGs where web search isn't sufficient.\n\nI need to structure the answer with these points, citing the relevant sentences. Make sure each statement has the correct citations. Check if all the key points are covered and the citations are accurate."

[S124] Using the above methods, we collected 2,425 Web Questions and 1,984 KG Questions, with 661, 658,\nand 665 KG Questions containing head, torso, and tail entities respectively. [S125] Tables 3 and 4 summarize\nthe distribution of the questions across different dimensions. [S126] The size of each dimension slice (e.g.,\nfast-changing facts) allows us to get metrics with \u0103 5% margin-of-error (with 95% confidence level)\nfor most of the cases. [S127] The dynamism distribution roughly reflects the nature of the domain (e.g.,\nmuch more real-time questions for Finance than for other domains). [S128] See Appendix A.1.2 for the\ndefinition of the dynamism categories. [S129] 3.2 Contents for retrieval\n\nWe included two types of contents for retrieval to simulate the practical scenario for RAG: web search\nand KG search. [S130] Web search results. [S131] For each question, we used the question text as the search query and stored up\nto 50 HTML pages from the Brave search API [5]. [S132] See Table 8 in Appendix A.1.5 for an example. [S133] We estimated the web search recall with a heuristic-based method: first check whether the ground\ntruth answer URL was found among the pages; if not, decide whether the fact in the ground truths is\ncontained in the page snippet or content with an LLM. [S134] In particular, we pass the question, ground\ntruth, and the pages to Llama 3 70B Instruct and ask it to judge if the context is sufficient to answer\nthe question. [S135] 5\n\n\fFigure 2: For 85% of CRAG questions, the web search results are estimated to contain the ground\ntruth facts. [S136] The curve shows that the retrieval recall grows sharply at the beginning and flattens out\nlater on. [S137] Figure 2 shows the estimated web search recall curve for all CRAG questions, with an overall recall\nof 85% when using all 50 pages. [S138] It reflects multiple advantages of the benchmark by design. [S139] First,\nthe recall curves are sharp at the beginning and flatten out later, and the recall for the top 5 pages is\nabout 69%. [S140] This is comparable to what we observe in practice when developing a RAG system. [S141] The\nnon-perfect coverage, especially for Task 1, allows us to test whether the RAG solutions admit \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know\u201d when the retrieval results do not contain the necessary information. [S142] Second, compared\nto the recall from web snippets, full web pages increase the recall by about 20%, emphasizing the\nimportance of extracting and understanding HTML contents. [S143] Moreover, the estimated web search\nrecall (50 web pages) is 93% for Web Questions and 74% for KG Questions, indicating significantly\nlower recall for KG questions than web questions. [S144] This aligns with our observations that web search\nrecall for torso and tail entities is typically lower, underlining the crucial role of leveraging KGs in\nTask 2 and 3.",

        "[S936] We send the CRAG public test set question as input to each of the SOTA RAG systems and collect\nthe responses for human grading. [S937] Note that the original Query Time and the provided retrieval results\nin CRAG are not used in this setting. [S938] We simply test the questions and ask human graders to grade\nthe responses based on when the query was made to the SOTA system. [S939] We called Copilot Pro,\nGemini Advanced, and ChatGPT Plus through their web interfaces and Perplexity.ai through its API. [S940] Meta SG, designed as a smart glasses (SG) assistant, includes default on-device components such as\nAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS), which are not typically enabled\nby default in other systems.

[S943] We set the conversation style to \u201cPrecise\u201d when calling Copilot Pro and the temperature\nto 0 when calling Perplexity.ai. [S944] We select GPT-4o and llama-3-sonar-large-32k-online as the\nbase LLM when calling ChatGPT Plus and Perplexity.ai, respectively. [S945] A.4.2 Latency\n\nWe quantified the latency by calculating the time difference between the timestamp of the query\nsubmission to the system and the timestamp when the complete response was received. [S946] The latency of Perplexity.ai measured via API call is 2,455ms. [S947] Since latency measured by API call\nand web interface interactions are not directly comparable, we further called Perplexity.ai through\nits web interface and reported the latency under this setting in Table 6. [S948] Note that this latency may\nnot correspond to the accuracy numbers from the API calls. [S949] For Meta SG, we estimated a latency\ncomparable to other web interface interactions by excluding on-device components such as ASR and\nTTS from the overall end-to-end latency measurement. [S950] A.5 Limitations\n\nThe three tasks in our benchmark do not directly evaluate the construction of a first-stage retrieval\ncandidate pool, a demanding retrieval task in its own right. [S951] This design decision ensures that the\ncompetition remains both challenging and achievable within the KDD Cup\u2019s required three-month\ntimeframe. [S952] Despite the limitation, users of our dataset have the option to use the union of all 220K\nweb pages as a corpus to build a retriever.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the trade-offs considered in the CRAG benchmark's design to balance challenge and feasibility, and how that affects dataset usage.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions several points. Let me scan through each sentence.\n\nLooking at Passage 1, sentence S950 says: \"The three tasks in our benchmark do not directly evaluate the construction of a first-stage retrieval candidate pool, a demanding retrieval task in its own right. This design decision ensures that the competition remains both challenging and achievable within the KDD Cup\u2019s required three-month timeframe.\" So here, they're talking about not evaluating a specific task (first-stage retrieval) to keep the competition manageable. That's a trade-off between comprehensiveness and feasibility.\n\nThen, S951 states: \"This design decision ensures that the competition remains both challenging and achievable within the KDD Cup\u2019s required three-month timeframe.\" So the trade-off here is between making the task challenging enough to be meaningful and keeping it feasible within time constraints.\n\nAnother part is S952: \"Despite the limitation, users of our dataset have the option to use the union of all 220K web pages as a corpus to build a retriever.\" This suggests that even though the benchmark doesn't cover everything, users can still use the full dataset for their own purposes. So the trade-off here is between a focused benchmark and the flexibility for users to expand upon it.\n\nAlso, S953 mentions: \"While this corpus does not match the entire web, it allows for fair comparisons and manageable costs.\" So they're balancing the comprehensiveness of the dataset (not the entire web) with the practicality of cost and manageability.\n\nNow, how does this affect dataset usage? The dataset provides a curated subset (220K web pages) which is manageable but not exhaustive. Users can use the union of all pages for their own retrievers, which means they can extend beyond the benchmark's scope. The trade-off here is between a manageable dataset for the benchmark and the flexibility for users to use a larger corpus.\n\nPutting this together, the main trade-offs are not evaluating certain complex tasks to keep the benchmark feasible, and providing a manageable dataset while allowing users to use a larger corpus. This affects dataset usage by offering a balanced dataset for the benchmark but giving users the option to expand their own retrievers with more data.\n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The key sentences are S950, S951, S952, S953. Let me check again. Yes, those sentences discuss the trade-offs and their impact on dataset usage."

[S4] Existing RAG datasets, however, do not adequately represent the diverse and dy-\nnamic nature of real-world Question Answering (QA) tasks. [S5] To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce the Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG), a factual question an-\nswering benchmark of 4,409 question-answer pairs and mock APIs to simulate web\nand Knowledge Graph (KG) search. [S6] CRAG is designed to encapsulate a diverse\narray of questions across five domains and eight question categories, reflecting\nvaried entity popularity from popular to long-tail, and temporal dynamisms ranging\nfrom years to seconds. [S7] Our evaluation of this benchmark highlights the gap to\nfully trustworthy QA. [S8] Whereas most advanced LLMs achieve \u010f 34% accuracy\non CRAG, adding RAG in a straightforward manner improves the accuracy only\nto 44%. [S9] State-of-the-art industry RAG solutions only answer 63% of questions\nwithout any hallucination. [S10] CRAG also reveals much lower accuracy in answer-\ning questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower popularity, or higher\ncomplexity, suggesting future research directions. [S11] The CRAG benchmark laid the\ngroundwork for a KDD Cup 2024 challenge and attracted thousands of participants\nand submissions. [S12] We commit to maintaining CRAG to serve research communities\nin advancing RAG solutions and general QA solutions. [S13] CRAG is available at\nhttps://github.com/facebookresearch/CRAG/. [S14] 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of Natural Language Processing\n(NLP) tasks, especially in Question Answering (QA) [20, 22, 38, 39]. [S15] Despite the advancements,\nthe issue of hallucination persists as a significant challenge; LLMs may generate answers that lack\nfactual accuracy or grounding [14,27,30,32]. [S16] Studies have shown that GPT-4\u2019s accuracy in answering\nquestions referring to slow-changing or fast-changing facts is below 15% [36]; even for stable (never-\nchanging) facts, GPT-4\u2019s accuracy in answering questions referring to torso-to-tail (less popular)\nentities is below 35% [29]. [S17] Overcoming hallucinations thus becomes a priority in building reliable\nQA systems [13, 14]. [S18] Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [6, 8, 12, 19] has recently emerged as a promising solution to\nalleviate LLM\u2019s deficiency in lack of knowledge and attracted a lot of attention from both academia\nresearch and industry. [S19] Given a question, a RAG system searches external sources to retrieve relevant\ninformation and then provides grounded answers [7, 12, 19] (see Figure 1 for an illustration). [S20] Despite\n\n\u02daEqual contribution. [S21] Correspondence to: Xiao Yang (xiaoyangfb@meta.com).

    "[S26] A comprehensive benchmark is currently missing to advance continued research efforts in this field. [S27] Our goal is to build a benchmark that can provide a holistic view of the important capabilities and\nfast but reliable evaluation for RAG to propel the area forward. [S28] What is a good benchmark for QA\nover LLMs? [S29] We consider five critical features. [S30] 1. [S31] Realism: First and foremost, a good benchmark shall best reflect real use cases. [S32] In other\nwords, a solution that achieves high metrics in the benchmark shall also perform very well in\nreal scenarios. [S33] For example, the questions in a RAG benchmark shall be similar to questions\npeople ask in real-world QA scenarios. [S34] 2. [S35] Richness: The benchmark shall contain a diverse set of instance types, covering both\ncommon use cases and some complex and advanced use cases, to represent real-world\nchallenges and reveal possible limitations of existing solutions. [S36] 3. [S37] Insightfulness: The benchmark shall allow for an easy understanding of performance on\ndifferent slices of the data, reflecting the capability of the solution in addressing different\ntypes of challenges. [S38] 4. [S39] Reliability: The benchmark shall allow reliable assessment of metrics: the ground truths\nshall be accurate; the metrics shall well capture the performance of the model; the evaluation\nshall be easy and reliable, and the computed metrics shall hold statistical significance. [S40] 5. [S41] Longevity: Finally, to enable research and experimental comparison in a long term, the\nscenarios and the data in the benchmark shall not quickly expire and ideally shall be refreshed\nand improved over time. [S42] We strive to create a benchmark that have all of the aforementioned features, and we call it CRAG \u2013\nComprehensive benchmark for RAG. [S43] Our work makes three contributions. [S44] Our first contribution is the dataset itself (Section 3). [S45] CRAG contains a rich set of 4,409 QA pairs\nfrom five domains: Finance, Sports, Music, Movie, and Open domain. [S46] In addition to simple-fact\nquestions (asking for an attribute of an entity), CRAG contains seven types of complex questions to\ncover real user queries: questions with Conditions, Comparison questions, Aggregation questions,\nMulti-hop questions, Set queries, Post-processing-heavy questions, and False-premise questions. [S47] CRAG reflects varied entity popularity from popular to long-tail and temporal spans ranging from\nseconds to years, allowing easy deep dives for insights. [S48] As we generated the questions, we referred\nto smart assistant use cases to make sure the questions are realistic, paraphrased the questions to\nincrease the diversity of expressions, and manually verified ground truths to ensure reliability. [S49] In addition to QA pairs, CRAG provides mock APIs to simulate retrieval from a diverse range of\navailable information. [S50] This includes up to 50 full HTML pages for each question returned from a\nreal-world search engine\u2014the Brave Search API [5], and mock KGs with 2.6 million entities. [S51] For the\nmock KGs, we deliberately make sure that the retrieval candidates reflect noises in a realistic setting. [S52] Our second contribution is the evaluation mechanism to allow for reliable comparisons. [S53] We designed\n3 tasks to test different components in RAG solutions: retrieval summarization, knowledge graph\nand web retrieval, and end-to-end retrieval-augmented generation (Section 2). [S54] Instead of computing\nthe percentage of correctly answered questions, our score system distinguishes hallucinated answers\nand missing answers, and gives the former a higher penalty as it can be more harmful to ruin user\n\n2\n\nLLMWhat is the gold price today?Gold price is at $1626.81 per ounce today Oct 21 2022.Gold price is at $2020.8 per ounce today Jan 28 2024.DocumentsWeb SearchReal-time APIsKnowledge GraphRetrieved relevantknowledgeQuestion (a) LLM Direct Generation(b) RAG: Retrieved-Augmented Generation with LLM\fTable 1: Comparing CRAG to existing benchmarks for factual question answering.

[S57] We also design an effective automatic evaluation mechanism to allow for fast evaluations and\niterations (Section 4). [S58] Our third contribution is a comprehensive evaluation of straightforward RAG solutions and industry\nstate-of-the-art solutions on RAG (Section 5). [S59] Whereas most advanced LLMs achieve \u010f 34%\naccuracy on CRAG, adding RAG in a straightforward manner improves the accuracy only to 44%. [S60] State-of-the-art industry RAG solutions answer only 63% questions without any hallucination, still\nhaving much lower accuracy in answering questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower\npopularity, or higher complexity. [S61] These evaluations serve two roles: first, they demonstrate that\nCRAG has appropriate level of difficulty and allows insights drawn from different dimensions of\ndiversities the benchmark has incorporated; second, they highlight the gaps and research directions to\na fully trustworthy QA system. [S62] The CRAG benchmark laid the groundwork for a KDD Cup 2024 challenge2, has attracted thousands\nof participants and submissions within the first 50 days of the competition. [S63] We commit to maintaining\nCRAG to serve research communities in advancing RAG solutions and general QA solutions. [S64] Comparison with existing benchmarks. [S65] Table 1 compares CRAG with existing benchmarks for\nfactual question answering. [S66] Traditional QA benchmarks such as Natural Questions (NQ) [18],\nTriviaQA [16], MS MARCO [4], and QALD-10 [35] have advanced QA in the past decade but\nconsider only web retrieved or KG retrieved contents, and do not adequately represent the diverse\nand dynamic challenges that RAG is facing. [S67] New benchmarks for LLM or RAG usually target certain\ncapabilities of the QA system. [S68] Researchers created benchmarks to evaluate how well the systems\ncan answer simple knowledge questions [23, 29, 30] and handle more advanced scenarios. [S69] These\ninclude answering questions with changing answers [36], integrating information from multiple\ndocuments [6], addressing multi-hop questions [33], and answering questions with long texts [26]. [S70] Moreover, traditional QA benchmarks usually adopt matching-based metrics such as ROUGE [21]\nor F1 to evaluate the quality of the responses [16, 18]. [S71] These metrics, although working well for\nextractive methods, are known to not perform very effectively for LLMs that generate free-form\nresponses [11]. [S72] Despite CRAG being smaller than MS MARCO and NQ, it offers several distinctive advantages:\ncomprehensive coverage, realistic testing with mock APIs, dynamic question handling, diverse fact\npopularity, extensive content beyond Wikipedia, and fast yet reliable evaluation. [S73] These features make\nCRAG a robust and versatile benchmark for testing RAG systems and broadly QA systems, providing\na shared testbed to evaluate how these systems handle real-world, dynamic, and diverse information\nretrieval and synthesis challenges for reliable LLM-based question answering. [S74] 2 Problem Description\n\nA RAG QA system takes a question Q as input and outputs an answer A; the answer is generated\nby LLMs according to information retrieved from external sources or directly from the knowledge\ninternalized in the model. [S75] The answer should provide useful information to answer the question\nwithout adding any hallucination.

[S82] Questions that compare two entities (e.g., \u201cwho started performing earlier, Adele or\nEd Sheeran?\u201d). [S83] Questions that require aggregation of retrieval results to answer (e.g., \u201chow many\nOscar awards did Meryl Streep win?\u201d). [S84] Questions that require chaining multiple pieces of information to compose the answer\n(e.g., \u201cwho acted in Ang Lee\u2019s latest movie?\u201d). [S85] Questions that need reasoning or processing of the retrieved information to obtain\nthe answer (e.g., \u201chow many days did Thurgood Marshall serve as a Supreme Court\njustice?\u201d). [S86] Questions that have a false preposition or assumption (e.g., \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of\nTaylor Swift\u2019s rap album before she transitioned to pop?\u201d (Taylor Swift has not yet\nreleased any rap album)). [S87] We designed three tasks. [S88] They share the same set of (question, answer) pairs but differ in the external\ndata accessible for retrieval to augment QA. [S89] Here, we provide the content that can be leveraged in\nQA to ensure fair comparisons. [S90] We describe how we generated the data in Section 3. [S91] Task 1: Retrieval Summarization. [S92] In Task 1, we provide up to five web pages for each question. [S93] These web pages are likely, but not guaranteed, to be relevant to the question. [S94] This task aims to test\nthe answer generation capability of a RAG system. [S95] Task 2: KG and Web Retrieval Augmentation. [S96] In Task 2, we in addition provide mock APIs to\naccess information from underlying mock KGs. [S97] The mock KGs store structured data relevant to the\nquestions; answers to the questions may or may not exist in the mock KGs. [S98] The mock APIs take\ninput parameters, oftentimes parsed from the question, and provide structured data from the mocked\nKGs to support answer generation. [S99] This task tests how well a RAG system 1) queries structured data\nsources and 2) synthesizes information from different sources. [S100] Task 3: End-to-end RAG. [S101] Similar to Task 2, Task 3 also provides both web search results and mock\nAPIs as candidates for retrieval but provides 50 web pages, instead of 5, as candidates. [S102] The larger set\nof web pages are more likely to provide necessary information to answer the question, but meanwhile\nare more likely to contain noises. [S103] As such, Task 3 in addition tests how a RAG system ranks a larger\nnumber of retrieval results. [S104] The three tasks, each adding upon the previous one, allow testing different capabilities of the RAG\nsystems. [S105] The only component of a RAG system not covered by these tasks is search retrieval. [S106] One\nmay easily extend the tasks to use all 220K webpages in our benchmark as the search corpus for fully\nend-to-end testing. [S107] 3 Dataset Description\n\nCRAG contains two parts of data: the QA pairs and the contents for retrieval. [S108] We now describe each\npart of the data. [S109] Data generation details can be found in Appendix A.1.1\u2013A.1.6.

[S117] The question types are listed in Table 2. [S118] We constructed the question-answer\npairs both from underlying KGs and web contents. [S119] QA pairs constructed from KGs. [S120] We constructed QA pairs from KGs by collecting a set of entities\nbased on publicly available data and then creating 600+ question templates based on selected entity\ntypes and relations. [S121] Next, we sampled entities with different popularities (head, torso and tail)\nfollowing [29] from the KGs to fill in the templates and generate the full question and answer. [S122] QA pairs constructed from web contents. [S123] We asked annotators to write down possible questions\nthat users may ask (e.g., \u201cmost popular action movies in 2023\u201d) and created QA pairs from the\ncorresponding web search results. [S124] Using the above methods, we collected 2,425 Web Questions and 1,984 KG Questions, with 661, 658,\nand 665 KG Questions containing head, torso, and tail entities respectively. [S125] Tables 3 and 4 summarize\nthe distribution of the questions across different dimensions. [S126] The size of each dimension slice (e.g.,\nfast-changing facts) allows us to get metrics with \u0103 5% margin-of-error (with 95% confidence level)\nfor most of the cases. [S127] The dynamism distribution roughly reflects the nature of the domain (e.g.,\nmuch more real-time questions for Finance than for other domains). [S128] See Appendix A.1.2 for the\ndefinition of the dynamism categories. [S129] 3.2 Contents for retrieval\n\nWe included two types of contents for retrieval to simulate the practical scenario for RAG: web search\nand KG search. [S130] Web search results. [S131] For each question, we used the question text as the search query and stored up\nto 50 HTML pages from the Brave search API [5]. [S132] See Table 8 in Appendix A.1.5 for an example. [S133] We estimated the web search recall with a heuristic-based method: first check whether the ground\ntruth answer URL was found among the pages; if not, decide whether the fact in the ground truths is\ncontained in the page snippet or content with an LLM. [S134] In particular, we pass the question, ground\ntruth, and the pages to Llama 3 70B Instruct and ask it to judge if the context is sufficient to answer\nthe question. [S135] 5\n\n\fFigure 2: For 85% of CRAG questions, the web search results are estimated to contain the ground\ntruth facts. [S136] The curve shows that the retrieval recall grows sharply at the beginning and flattens out\nlater on. [S137] Figure 2 shows the estimated web search recall curve for all CRAG questions, with an overall recall\nof 85% when using all 50 pages. [S138] It reflects multiple advantages of the benchmark by design. [S139] First,\nthe recall curves are sharp at the beginning and flatten out later, and the recall for the top 5 pages is\nabout 69%. [S140] This is comparable to what we observe in practice when developing a RAG system. [S141] The\nnon-perfect coverage, especially for Task 1, allows us to test whether the RAG solutions admit \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know\u201d when the retrieval results do not contain the necessary information. [S142] Second, compared\nto the recall from web snippets, full web pages increase the recall by about 20%, emphasizing the\nimportance of extracting and understanding HTML contents. [S143] Moreover, the estimated web search\nrecall (50 web pages) is 93% for Web Questions and 74% for KG Questions, indicating significantly\nlower recall for KG questions than web questions. [S144] This aligns with our observations that web search\nrecall for torso and tail entities is typically lower, underlining the crucial role of leveraging KGs in\nTask 2 and 3.",
    "[S145] Mock KGs. [S146] We created mock KGs that contain publicly available KG data used to generate the\nquestions, randomly selected entities of the same type, and also \u201chard negative\u201d entities with similar\nnames (e.g., \u201cphantom\u201d for \u201cphantom of the opera\u201d). [S147] Mock APIs. [S148] We created mock APIs with pre-defined parameters to support structured search in the\nmock KGs. [S149] For example, for queries asking for stock prices, an example mock API is in the form of\nget_price_history(ticker). [S150] We collected snapshots of the KG and web search data concurrently while posing real-time and\nfast-changing questions. [S151] This approach ensures that we capture the \u201csnapshot\u201d of the information\nworld at the time of question answering. [S152] A RAG solution that performs well on the benchmark should\nalso be capable of reasoning over time and generalizing to evolving questions. [S153] In total, the resulting data contains 220K webpages, a KG of 2.6M entities, and 38 mock APIs. [S154] See\nTable 9 in the Appendix for a complete list of the mock APIs. [S155] 4 Metrics and Evaluation\n\nIn this section, we present the metrics for evaluating the RAG systems and briefly describe the 2024\nMeta KDD Cup challenge in Appendix A.2.3. [S156] 4.1 Metrics\n\nWe use a scoring method to assess the performance of RAG systems. [S157] For each question in the\nevaluation set, we first label the answer with perfect, acceptable, missing, or incorrect, according to\nthe following criteria. [S158] Perfect. [S159] The response correctly answers the user\u2019s question and contains no hallucinated content. [S160] 6\n\n05101520253035404550Number of retrieved web pages0102030405060708090100Estimated recall (%)45.152.856.157.659.560.861.862.863.564.469.476.279.080.181.182.282.983.683.984.6Page snippets+ Full pages\fAcceptable. [S161] The response provides a useful answer to the user\u2019s question but may contain minor\nerrors that do not harm the usefulness of the answer. [S162] Missing. [S163] The response is \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t find ...\u201d, a system error such as an empty\nresponse, or a request from the system to clarify the original question. [S164] Incorrect. [S165] The response provides wrong or irrelevant information to answer the user\u2019s question. [S166] We use a scoring method with score 1, 0.5, 0, and \u00b41 for each perfect, acceptable, missing, and\nincorrect answer, respectively, where we penalize hallucinated answers and prefer missing answers to\nincorrect ones. [S167] We then define truthfulness as the average score from all examples in the evaluation\nset for a given RAG system. [S168] 4.2 Evaluation\n\nSimilar to previous work [37], we employ both human evaluation (human-eval) and model-based\nautomatic evaluation (auto-eval). [S169] In the former, we use manual grading to judge perfect, acceptable,\nmissing, and incorrect for each answer. [S170] In the latter, we merge perfect and acceptable, call it accurate,\nand use a three-way scoring system with 1, \u00b41, 0 for accurate, incorrect, and missing answers. [S171] We design a two-step method for automatic evaluation: if the answer matches the ground truth exactly,\nit is considered accurate; otherwise, we use LLMs to determine whether the response is accurate,\nincorrect, or missing. [S172] To avoid the self-preference problem [25], we use two LLM evaluators:\nChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-0125) [24] and Llama 3 (llama-3-70B-instruct) [2] and report the\naverage accurate, hallucination, missing rates, and truthfulness scores from the two models for each\nRAG system. [S173] Our offline experiment shows that this two-step method yields an average F1 score of\n94.7% for ChatGPT and 98.9% for Llama 3 compared to human-eval. [S174] See Appendix A.2.2 for more\ndetails.",
    "[S175] Test data split. [S176] We split the data randomly into validation (30%), public test (30%), and private\n(40%), and released the validation and public test sets (Appendix A.2.3). [S177] Participants of the KDD\nCup challenge can use the validation and public test sets to develop and test their models, and the\nsubmitted solutions were evaluated on the private test set. [S178] Future offline users of CRAG can use\nthe validation set for development, fine-tuning, and validation, and the public test set for testing and\nresult reporting. [S179] 5 Benchmarking\n\nIn this section, we present the performance of LLMs and RAG systems on CRAG, demonstrating\nthat CRAG has a reasonable level of difficulty and can help draw insights and show directions in\ndeveloping RAG techniques. [S180] 5.1 Straightforward RAG solutions\n\nExperiment setup: We started with running LLM-only solutions on the CRAG public test\nset with 1, 335 questions, using simple prompts that encourage brief answers and \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow\u201d answers when the confidence is low (Appendix A.3.1). [S181] We employed Llama 2 Chat\n(llama-2-7b-chat and llama-2-70b-chat) [34], Llama 3 Instruct (llama-3-8B-instruct and\nllama-3-70B-instruct) [2], Mixtral (Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) [15], Falcon (40B) [3],\nFLAN-T5 (FLAN-T5-XXL) [9], and GPT-4 Turbo (gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09) [1]. [S182] The web-only\nRAG solutions we evaluated (Task 1) used a fixed-length web context window (1K tokens for Falcon\nand FLAN-T5, 2K for Llama 2 Chat, and 4K for Llama 3 Instruct and GPT-4 Turbo); we concatenated\nwebpage snippets using the original order from the data as the reference text, until filling up the\nwindow (similar to [17, 23, 36]). [S183] Our KG-based solutions (Tasks 2, 3) additionally used a fixed-length\nKG context window (0.5K tokens for Falcon and FLAN-T5, 1K for Llama 2 Chat, and 2K for Llama\n3 Instruct and GPT-4 Turbo) to include the results from the mock APIs; we extracted the relevant\nquery entities using llama-3-8B-instruct with in-context learning (similar to [28]) detailed in\nAppendix A.3.1 and concatenated the results returned from all applicable mock APIs (based on the\nextracted entities), until filling up the window. [S184] We provide an extensive comparison of all LLMs\nin Appendix A.3.2 and focus on the best-performing LLMs (i.e., Llama 3 70B Instruct and GPT-4\nTurbo) in this section. [S185] 7\n\n\fTable 5: Performance of straightforward RAG solutions. [S186] All numbers are in percentage.

    "[S190] Table 5 shows the average evaluation results from the two auto-evaluators (ChatGPT and Llama 3) and\nillustrates that the CRAG benchmark is non-trivial. [S191] First, the best LLM-only solutions (GPT-4 Turbo)\nobtained an accuracy of only 34%, with truthfulness of 20%, showing a big room for improvement. [S192] Second, straightforward RAG solutions obtained up to 44% accuracy, showing that extra information\ndoes help answer more questions reliably. [S193] Interestingly, none of the RAG solutions obtain truthfulness\nhigher than 20%; this is because all RAG solutions introduce more hallucinations generated from\nirrelevant retrieval results, showing a big challenge in RAG\u2014How to judiciously use retrieval results\nwithout being distracted by retrieval noises? [S194] Third, we found that Task 2 truthfulness scores are\nhigher than Task 1, showing that the KG knowledge helps improve accuracy, with a similar or even\nlower hallucination rate, because the KG knowledge is typically brief but precise. [S195] Unfortunately, the\nimprovement is mediocre, showing a second challenge in RAG\u2014How to best leverage the power of\nKG data? [S196] Finally, the truthfulness for Task 3 are also higher than Task 2, because of better search\nranking (recall that Task 1 and 2 provide five pages randomly selected from the top-10 search results)\nand better search recall. [S197] In particular, we found that the ground truths of over 30% of questions are\navailable in the web retrieval results but are not included in the prompt due to the context window\nlimitation. [S198] This shows the importance of search ranking in RAG. [S199] Figure 3 shows the auto-eval results across the domain, dynamism, popularity, and question type\ndimension. [S200] The results reveal a lot of interesting observations and show that the CRAG benchmark\nallows more insightful conclusions. [S201] First, it shows which slices of the benchmark are harder. [S202] For\nexample, we found much lower RAG truthfulness on the Finance and Sports domains, for real-\n\n8\n\nFinanceSportsMusicMovieOpen10010203040-4-131338-13619194040192623-109303135(a) DomainReal-timeFast-changingSlow-changingStatic100102030-1-7-148-15-149250-1524-5-81528(b) DynamismWebHeadTorsoTail05101520-16-101612110152111818171814(c) PopularitySimpleSimple w.

    "[S210] time and fast-changing facts, for tail entities, and for complex questions requiring set answers,\npost-processing, and with false premises. [S211] Second, it shows where it is harder to leverage retrieval\nresults. [S212] Take the popularity slices as an example, we observed that GPT-4 Turbo\u2019s truthfulness\ndropped from head (21%) to torso (11%) to tail (8%), consistent with past observations [29]; however,\nthe straightforward RAG solution based on GPT-4 Turbo improved QA quality regarding torso\n(+7%) and tail entities (+6%) but lowered the quality regarding head (-4%). [S213] Finally, although\nour goal is not to compare different LLMs, the different dimensions allow us to understand the\nstrengths and weaknesses of each method. [S214] For example, although the RAG system based on Llama\n3 70B Instruct has a lower overall truthfulness score than the one based on GPT-4 Turbo, it has a\nsimilar or slightly higher truthfulness in answering simple and comparison questions, whereas much\nlower truthfulness in answering set and post-processing questions, suggesting investigations on the\nreasoning capabilities. [S215] 5.2 State-of-the-art industry solutions\n\nNext, we evaluated industry state-of-the-art (SOTA) RAG solutions on CRAG public test set. [S216] We\nselected five RAG systems built upon SOTA LLMs and search engines, queried them with CRAG\nquestions, collected the responses, and applied manual grading (details in Appendix A.4). [S217] In addition, we applied traffic weights to the questions to understand the solutions in real-world use\ncases. [S218] The traffic weights reflect the frequency of each question type, as defined in Table 2, in real\nQA traffic. [S219] We gave the same weights to all domains and reported the macro average across domains. [S220] This is because we have observed quite different domain-level distributions in different use cases, but\nhave been observing similar distributions at the query-type level. [S221] Table 6 and Figure 4 show the overall performance of the SOTA systems and their performance\nacross different dimensions. [S222] The evaluation results confirm our belief that the CRAG benchmark\nreveals interesting insights and shows room for improvement for existing RAG solutions. [S223] First,\nthe results from SOTA solutions achieve much better truthfulness (highest 51%) compared to the\nstraightforward solutions. [S224] However, the hallucination rate ranges from 16% to 25%, so the answers\nare still not trustworthy. [S225] Note that the truthfulness scores between the SOTA solutions and the\nstraightforward solutions are not completely comparable, as they have different accesses to retrieval\ncontents (Appendix A.3 and A.4.1), and the former used auto-eval, while the latter used human-eval;\nhowever, the trend is valid. [S226] Second, we observed very different latency, ranging from 3.4s to 11.6s,\nreflecting the different design options in trading off latency and quality; for example, Copilot Pro\nhas the highest truthfulness, but meanwhile highest latency, whereas Meta SG [10] has mid-tier\ntruthfulness but lowest latency. [S227] (See Appendix A.4.2 for additional results and how we measured\nlatency.) Third, most difficult slices we see in the straightforward solutions remain to be difficult for\nSOTA solutions: real-time and fast-changing queries, and questions regarding torso and tail entities,\nshowing the improvement needed for handling retrieval noises when the system relies on retrieval\nresults to answer the question; as another example, we see lower truthfulness for queries requiring\naggregation, multi-hop reasoning or post-processing, showing the improvement space for reasoning\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 4: SOTA systems human-eval truthfulness scores (in percentage) across different dimensions. [S228] in question answering. [S229] Last, truthfulness on set and false premise questions improved significantly\nin the SOTA solutions compared to the straightforward solutions, showing advancement in RAG\nsystems in providing accurate and complete set answers and detecting false premises. [S230] 6 Conclusion",
    "[S231] This paper proposes CRAG, a rich and comprehensive benchmark designed to advance research in\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG). [S232] With detailed empirical studies, CRAG reviewed gaps in\nexisting RAG solutions and provided valuable insights for future improvement. [S233] We plan to continue\nimproving and expanding the benchmark for multi-lingual questions, multi-modal questions, multi-\nturn conversations, etc., to ensure CRAG stays at the forefront to push RAG research, adapts to\nemerging challenges, and evolves for new research needs.

[S703] In\n\nNeurIPS, 2024. [S704] 12\n\n\fA Appendix\n\nA.1 Dataset\n\nA.1.1 Constructing QA pairs from KGs\n\nWe first collected a set of entities based on publicly available data. [S705] Then we created question-answer\npairs in three steps for Simple static and dynamic questions. [S706] Step 1. [S707] For each domain, we first selected an entity type and a meaningful relation pe, rq and created\na question template. [S708] For example, for (music artist, first album), we create a template \u201cwhat is the\nfirst album of [music artist]?\u201d. [S709] Step 2. [S710] We then sampled entities from the KGs to fill in the templates and generate the full question. [S711] We adopted the method described in [29] and sampled entities of top, middle, and bottom popularity. [S712] We defined popularity based on heuristics for each entity type and created an equal number of\nquestions for each bucket. [S713] Step 3. [S714] Last, we took the associated attribute values as the answer to the question to create question-\nanswer pairs.",
    "[S715] We created the Comparison, Aggregation, Set, Post-processing, and False-premise questions in a\nsimilar way but 1) made sure the template allows for crisp and deterministic answers and 2) sampled\nthe subject entities that fit the question. [S716] We used heuristics to select entity types for these question\ncategories. [S717] Finally, we created multi-hop questions in three steps, similar to those described in [31]. [S718] We first\nsampled an entity e1 from the KG and selected two relation triplets following a two-hop path:\npe1, r1, e2q and pe1, r2, e3q. [S719] We then created a question template describing the path. [S720] For example,\nfor path (company1, is_parent, company2) followed by (company1, ceo, person), we created the\ntemplate \"who is the CEO of the parent company of [company2]?\". [S721] The answer to the new question\nwill be e3 in the second triplet. [S722] A.1.2 Definition of dynamism categories\n\nTable 7: Definition of dynamism categories. [S723] Dynamism\n\nDefinition\n\nReal-time\n\nThe answer to the question changes over seconds\n(e.g., \u201cWhat\u2019s Costco\u2019s stock price today?\u201d). [S724] Fast-changing\n\nThe answer to the question changes no more than daily\n(e.g., \u201cWhen is Laker\u2019s game tonight?\u201d). [S725] Slow-changing\n\nThe answer to the question changes no more than yearly\n(e.g., \u201cWho won the Grammy award last year?\u201d). [S726] Static\n\nThe answer to the question does not change over time,\nsuch as the birth date of a person. [S727] A.1.3 Constructing QA pairs from web contents\n\nStep 1. [S728] Ask annotators to write down a list of questions that could possibly be answered by web\nsearch based on a general guideline (e.g., \u201cwhat is the most popular action movie in 2023?\u201d). [S729] Step 2. [S730] Generate the web search results to answer the question. [S731] Step 3. [S732] Finally, annotators reviewed the web search results to determine the ground truth answers to\nthe questions: 1) If the search results successfully provided the necessary information, annotators\nrecorded the ground truth answer text and the URL associated with it based on the retrieved content. [S733] Note that the answer is determined by the query_time at which the web search happened, especially\nfor the Fast-changing and Real-time questions. [S734] 2) Otherwise, annotators conducted further web\nsearches to document the correct answers. [S735] 13\n\n\fBesides the QA pairs, the annotators will also provide labels for the domain, dynamism, question\ntypes, and an answer URL (a URL that contains the answer to the question) for Web Questions. [S736] A.1.4 Validation for the QA pairs\n\nWe conducted two phases of dataset validation with our in-house Linguist team. [S737] Phase 1. [S738] Question and meta-label validation. [S739] After the initial round of QA pair generation, an\naudit session was conducted, where expert annotators reviewed the question template, questions,\nand meta-labels (domain, question type, etc), applying edits as necessary with 2x human review\n(agreement rate 90%`). [S740] All problematic questions (e.g., a wrong false-premise question) were\nrevised, and all conflicting labels were resolved by a third more experienced auditor. [S741] Phase 2. [S742] Answer validation. [S743] To ensure the answers in the benchmark are correct, we further\nconducted an auditing process for all the answers. [S744] For the web questions, an annotation team\nreviewed each question and conducted an extensive search to make sure the answer is factually\ncorrect and includes comprehensive information (such as for set questions) with 2x human review\n(agreement rate 90%`). [S745] A third more experienced auditor then reviewed all conflicting answers and\nprovided a resolution. [S746] For the KG questions, a team of five engineers carefully checked the questions\nand queried the mock APIs manually to validate the answers. [S747] This step resulted in a 5% answer\ncorrection. [S748] In both phases, we paid special attention to examples where the straightforward solutions output\ndifferent answers from the ground truth answers and asked the auditing team to double-check those\nexamples.

[S753] CRAG provides both structured (through mock KGs) and unstructured (web search results) informa-\ntion to test the effectiveness of RAG systems in leveraging a diverse range of available information. [S754] First, for each question in the benchmark, CRAG provides up to 50 web search results from a real-\nworld search engine\u2014the Brave Search API [5]. [S755] Different from existing benchmarks that use snippets\nor selected text chunks [4, 6], CRAG provides full HTML pages, containing more information and\npotentially more noises as in a realistic setting. [S756] Second, CRAG provides mock KG search APIs to test\nstructured search for RAG. [S757] The mock KGs, though much smaller in size, contain both information\nnecessary to answer a subset of questions in the benchmark and noises that have similar entity or\nattribute names, again simulating real settings. [S758] Our mock KGs contain about 2.6M entities and have\na signal-to-noise ratio of less than 1/30. [S759] 14\n\n\fTable 9: Mock APIs and Descriptions.

[S798] A.2 Evaluation\n\nA.2.1 Human evaluation\n\nWe run human evaluation to score each answer with respect to the metrics defined in Section 4.1. [S799] We score each perfect, acceptable, missing, or incorrect answer with a score sp, sa, sm, and sin,\nrespectively and define truthfulnessh as the score of the answer by setting sp \u201c 1, sa \u201c 0.5, sm \u201c 0,\nand sin \u201c \u00b41. [S800] We then compute the average truthfulness for all examples in the evaluation set as the\ntruthfulness score for the RAG solution. [S801] Human-eval instructions. [S802] The human-eval instructions are as follows. [S803] Given a query, a query day and time at which the query was made, the chatbot\u2019s response, grade the\naccuracy for the response according to the criteria below:\nUsing an external search engine, please evaluate the factual accuracy of the response based on the\ngrading rubric below. [S804] An accurate answer should be factually correct and provide useful information\nto answer the user\u2019s question. [S805] \u2022 Accuracy = 0 (Missing). [S806] It covers the following situations. [S807] There is no response. [S808] There is a\nfailure to provide a response to the request (e.g. [S809] \u201cI\u2019m sorry . [S810] . [S811] . [S812] . [S813] . [S814] . [S815] , I can\u2019t do . [S816] . [S817] . [S818] \u201d) due to\ninability. [S819] E.g., Query: \u201cLatest news about the Nobel prize today.\u201d Response: \u201cI can\u2019t find\nspecific information regarding the Nobel prize . [S820] . [S821] . [S822] \u201d The response fails to answer and asks\nfollow-up questions. [S823] \u2022 Accuracy = 1 (Incorrect). [S824] It covers the following situations. [S825] The answer is unintelligible. [S826] The answer is poorly formed. [S827] The answer contains a major hallucination (e.g. [S828] wrong date,\n\n15\n\n\fTable 10: Accuracy and F1 for the ChatGPT and Llama 3 auto-evaluation models.

[S830] The answer is irrelevant to the user\u2019s\nrequest. [S831] Answers in a category, location, or time window that is significantly different from\nthe user\u2019s request, if any. [S832] There is a significant structural/formatting error. [S833] The response is\notherwise a total structural/functional failure and does not contain sufficient well-formed\ncontent that can be used to determine accuracy",
    "[S834] \u2022 Accuracy = 2 (Acceptable). [S835] It covers the following situations. [S836] The answer is acceptably\ncorrect and relevant to the user\u2019s request, but may miss some information, i.e. [S837] accurate but\nnot complete, or mostly accurate with minor issues. [S838] The answer may contain some minor\nhallucination that doesn\u2019t significantly alter the overall meaning. [S839] \u201cMinor hallucination\u201d\nmeans the answer addressed the user\u2019s question but might be off on some additional details. [S840] The rule of thumb is to see if the answer serves the purpose of the user\u2019s question, and\nwhether the hallucination could mislead the users on what they were asking. [S841] \u2022 Accuracy = 3 (Accurate). [S842] The answer is factually correct, contains all the relevant informa-\ntion requested, responds appropriately to the query, and does not contain any hallucination. [S843] We requested two human graders to grade each question (agreement rate 94%), and when there is a\nconflict, a third more experienced grader will resolve it. [S844] A.2.2 Automatic evaluation\n\nIn auto-eval, we merge perfect and acceptable as accurate and consider only three scores: 1 for\naccurate, 0 for missing, and -1 for incorrect. [S845] The truthfulnessa is calculated by the average\ntruthfulness for all the examples in the evaluation set, and is effectively\n\naccuracy \u00b4 hallucination,\n\nwhere accuracy, hallucination, and missing are the percentage of accurate, incorrect, and missing\nanswers in the test set. [S846] These score choices penalize incorrect answers, award correct, and assign a\nvalue of 0 to missing answers. [S847] Auto-evaluators. [S848] We computed the accuracy and F1 for the two auto-evaluators for the accurate,\nincorrect, and missing examples in the public test set, respectively. [S849] Here, we considered human-eval\nlabels as the ground truth. [S850] Table 10 shows both models attain reasonable accuracy and F1 scores as\nan evaluator compared to human evaluation. [S851] If the model prediction matches any provided answers from the Ground Truth Answer list,\n\nAuto-eval prompt. [S852] The prompt we used in the auto-eval is similar to the following. [S853] We did not\nrelease the exact prompt used in the challenge to avoid prompt attack. [S854] PROMPT = \"\"\"# Task: You are given a Question, a model Prediction, and a list of Ground Truth\nanswers, judge whether the model Prediction matches any answer from the list of Ground Truth\nanswers. [S855] Follow the instructions step by step to make a judgement. [S856] 1. [S857] \"Accuracy\" should be \"True\"; otherwise, \"Accuracy\" should be \"False\". [S858] 2. [S859] If the model prediction says that it couldn\u2019t answer the question or it doesn\u2019t have enough\ninformation, \"Accuracy\" should always be \"False\". [S860] 3. [S861] If the Ground Truth is \"invalid question\", \"Accuracy\" is \"True\" only if the model prediction is\nexactly \"invalid question\". [S862] # Output:\nRespond with only a single JSON string with an \"Accuracy\" field which is \"True\" or \"False\". [S863] # Examples:\nQuestion: how many seconds is 3 minutes 15 seconds?

    "[S870] The KDD Cup 2024 Meta CRAG challenge has two stages. [S871] Stage 1 is designed for the participants to\ndevelop their RAG solutions by submitting their systems against the leaderboard, whereas Stage 2\ndetermines the final winners. [S872] We split our benchmark data into three sets with similar distributions:\nvalidation, public test, and private test at 30%, 30%, and 40%, respectively. [S873] We shared the validation\nand public test sets, in total, 2,706 examples in Stage 1, and held out the private test set to select the\nfinal winners in Stage 2. [S874] We used auto-eval for Stage 1, and selected top teams with auto-eval in\nStage 2 to conduct manual evaluation. [S875] A.3 Evaluating straightforward RAG solutions\n\nWe send each CRAG question in a prompt shown below.

    "[S936] We send the CRAG public test set question as input to each of the SOTA RAG systems and collect\nthe responses for human grading. [S937] Note that the original Query Time and the provided retrieval results\nin CRAG are not used in this setting. [S938] We simply test the questions and ask human graders to grade\nthe responses based on when the query was made to the SOTA system. [S939] We called Copilot Pro,\nGemini Advanced, and ChatGPT Plus through their web interfaces and Perplexity.ai through its API. [S940] Meta SG, designed as a smart glasses (SG) assistant, includes default on-device components such as\nAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS), which are not typically enabled\nby default in other systems. [S941] To ensure a fair comparison, we excluded these on-device components,\n\n19\n\n\fensuring that answer quality was not affected. [S942] We called each system on the following dates in\nPacific Time: 05/12/2024\u201e05/16/2024 (Copilot Pro), 05/20/2024\u201e05/28/2024 (Gemini Advanced),\n05/27/2024\u201e06/02/2024 (ChatGPT Plus), 05/15/2024\u201e05/16/2024 (Perplexity.ai), and 07/02/2024\n(Meta SG). [S943] We set the conversation style to \u201cPrecise\u201d when calling Copilot Pro and the temperature\nto 0 when calling Perplexity.ai. [S944] We select GPT-4o and llama-3-sonar-large-32k-online as the\nbase LLM when calling ChatGPT Plus and Perplexity.ai, respectively. [S945] A.4.2 Latency\n\nWe quantified the latency by calculating the time difference between the timestamp of the query\nsubmission to the system and the timestamp when the complete response was received. [S946] The latency of Perplexity.ai measured via API call is 2,455ms. [S947] Since latency measured by API call\nand web interface interactions are not directly comparable, we further called Perplexity.ai through\nits web interface and reported the latency under this setting in Table 6. [S948] Note that this latency may\nnot correspond to the accuracy numbers from the API calls. [S949] For Meta SG, we estimated a latency\ncomparable to other web interface interactions by excluding on-device components such as ASR and\nTTS from the overall end-to-end latency measurement. [S950] A.5 Limitations\n\nThe three tasks in our benchmark do not directly evaluate the construction of a first-stage retrieval\ncandidate pool, a demanding retrieval task in its own right. [S951] This design decision ensures that the\ncompetition remains both challenging and achievable within the KDD Cup\u2019s required three-month\ntimeframe. [S952] Despite the limitation, users of our dataset have the option to use the union of all 220K\nweb pages as a corpus to build a retriever. [S953] While this corpus does not match the entire web, it allows\nfor fair comparisons and manageable costs. [S954] 20"
