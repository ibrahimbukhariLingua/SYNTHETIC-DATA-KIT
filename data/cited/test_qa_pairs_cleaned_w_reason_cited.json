[S4] Existing RAG datasets, however, do not adequately represent the diverse and dy-\nnamic nature of real-world Question Answering (QA) tasks. [S5] To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce the Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG), a factual question an-\nswering benchmark of 4,409 question-answer pairs and mock APIs to simulate web\nand Knowledge Graph (KG) search.

[S8] Whereas most advanced LLMs achieve \u010f 34% accuracy\non CRAG, adding RAG in a straightforward manner improves the accuracy only\nto 44%. [S9] State-of-the-art industry RAG solutions only answer 63% of questions\nwithout any hallucination. [S10] CRAG also reveals much lower accuracy in answer-\ning questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower popularity, or higher\ncomplexity, suggesting future research directions. [S11] The CRAG benchmark laid the\ngroundwork for a KDD Cup 2024 challenge and attracted thousands of participants\nand submissions. [S12] We commit to maintaining CRAG to serve research communities\nin advancing RAG solutions and general QA solutions. [S13] CRAG is available at\nhttps://github.com/facebookresearch/CRAG/. [S14] 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of Natural Language Processing\n(NLP) tasks, especially in Question Answering (QA) [20, 22, 38, 39]. [S15] Despite the advancements,\nthe issue of hallucination persists as a significant challenge; LLMs may generate answers that lack\nfactual accuracy or grounding [14,27,30,32]. [S16] Studies have shown that GPT-4\u2019s accuracy in answering\nquestions referring to slow-changing or fast-changing facts is below 15% [36]; even for stable (never-\nchanging) facts, GPT-4\u2019s accuracy in answering questions referring to torso-to-tail (less popular)\nentities is below 35% [29]. [S17] Overcoming hallucinations thus becomes a priority in building reliable\nQA systems [13, 14]. [S18] Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [6, 8, 12, 19] has recently emerged as a promising solution to\nalleviate LLM\u2019s deficiency in lack of knowledge and attracted a lot of attention from both academia\nresearch and industry. [S19] Given a question, a RAG system searches external sources to retrieve relevant\ninformation and then provides grounded answers [7, 12, 19] (see Figure 1 for an illustration). [S20] Despite\n\n\u02daEqual contribution. [S21] Correspondence to: Xiao Yang (xiaoyangfb@meta.com). [S22] 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024) Track on Datasets and Benchmarks. [S23] Figure 1: QA using LLMs (a) without RAG vs. [S24] (b) with RAG. [S25] its potential, RAG still faces many challenges, such as selecting the most relevant information,\nreducing question answering latency, and synthesizing information to answer complex questions. [S26] A comprehensive benchmark is currently missing to advance continued research efforts in this field. [S27] Our goal is to build a benchmark that can provide a holistic view of the important capabilities and\nfast but reliable evaluation for RAG to propel the area forward. [S28] What is a good benchmark for QA\nover LLMs? [S29] We consider five critical features. [S30] 1. [S31] Realism: First and foremost, a good benchmark shall best reflect real use cases. [S32] In other\nwords, a solution that achieves high metrics in the benchmark shall also perform very well in\nreal scenarios. [S33] For example, the questions in a RAG benchmark shall be similar to questions\npeople ask in real-world QA scenarios. [S34] 2. [S35] Richness: The benchmark shall contain a diverse set of instance types, covering both\ncommon use cases and some complex and advanced use cases, to represent real-world\nchallenges and reveal possible limitations of existing solutions. [S36] 3. [S37] Insightfulness: The benchmark shall allow for an easy understanding of performance on\ndifferent slices of the data, reflecting the capability of the solution in addressing different\ntypes of challenges. [S38] 4. [S39] Reliability: The benchmark shall allow reliable assessment of metrics: the ground truths\nshall be accurate; the metrics shall well capture the performance of the model; the evaluation\nshall be easy and reliable, and the computed metrics shall hold statistical significance. [S40] 5. [S41] Longevity: Finally, to enable research and experimental comparison in a long term, the\nscenarios and the data in the benchmark shall not quickly expire and ideally shall be refreshed\nand improved over time. [S42] We strive to create a benchmark that have all of the aforementioned features, and we call it CRAG \u2013\nComprehensive benchmark for RAG. [S43] Our work makes three contributions."

      "chunk": "Chunk:\n\n[S1] Longevity: Finally, to enable research and experimental comparison in a long term, the\nscenarios and the data in the benchmark shall not quickly expire and ideally shall be refreshed\nand improved over time. [S2] We strive to create a benchmark that have all of the aforementioned features, and we call it CRAG \u2013\nComprehensive benchmark for RAG. [S3] Our work makes three contributions. [S4] Our first contribution is the dataset itself (Section 3). [S5] CRAG contains a rich set of 4,409 QA pairs\nfrom five domains: Finance, Sports, Music, Movie, and Open domain. [S6] In addition to simple-fact\nquestions (asking for an attribute of an entity), CRAG contains seven types of complex questions to\ncover real user queries: questions with Conditions, Comparison questions, Aggregation questions,\nMulti-hop questions, Set queries, Post-processing-heavy questions, and False-premise questions. [S7] CRAG reflects varied entity popularity from popular to long-tail and temporal spans ranging from\nseconds to years, allowing easy deep dives for insights. [S8] As we generated the questions, we referred\nto smart assistant use cases to make sure the questions are realistic, paraphrased the questions to\nincrease the diversity of expressions, and manually verified ground truths to ensure reliability. [S9] In addition to QA pairs, CRAG provides mock APIs to simulate retrieval from a diverse range of\navailable information. [S10] This includes up to 50 full HTML pages for each question returned from a\nreal-world search engine\u2014the Brave Search API [5], and mock KGs with 2.6 million entities. [S11] For the\nmock KGs, we deliberately make sure that the retrieval candidates reflect noises in a realistic setting. [S12] Our second contribution is the evaluation mechanism to allow for reliable comparisons. [S13] We designed\n3 tasks to test different components in RAG solutions: retrieval summarization, knowledge graph\nand web retrieval, and end-to-end retrieval-augmented generation (Section 2). [S14] Instead of computing\nthe percentage of correctly answered questions, our score system distinguishes hallucinated answers\nand missing answers, and gives the former a higher penalty as it can be more harmful to ruin user\n\n2\n\nLLMWhat is the gold price today?Gold price is at $1626.81 per ounce today Oct 21 2022.Gold price is at $2020.8 per ounce today Jan 28 2024.DocumentsWeb SearchReal-time APIsKnowledge GraphRetrieved relevantknowledgeQuestion (a) LLM Direct Generation(b) RAG: Retrieved-Augmented Generation with LLM\fTable 1: Comparing CRAG to existing benchmarks for factual question answering.

[S16] We also design an effective automatic evaluation mechanism to allow for fast evaluations and\niterations (Section 4). [S17] Our third contribution is a comprehensive evaluation of straightforward RAG solutions and industry\nstate-of-the-art solutions on RAG (Section 5). [S18] Whereas most advanced LLMs achieve \u010f 34%\naccuracy on CRAG, adding RAG in a straightforward manner improves the accuracy only to 44%. [S19] State-of-the-art industry RAG solutions answer only 63% questions without any hallucination, still\nhaving much lower accuracy in answering questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower\npopularity, or higher complexity. [S20] These evaluations serve two roles: first, they demonstrate that\nCRAG has appropriate level of difficulty and allows insights drawn from different dimensions of\ndiversities the benchmark has incorporated; second, they highlight the gaps and research directions to\na fully trustworthy QA system. [S21] The CRAG benchmark laid the groundwork for a KDD Cup 2024 challenge2, has attracted thousands\nof participants and submissions within the first 50 days of the competition. [S22] We commit to maintaining\nCRAG to serve research communities in advancing RAG solutions and general QA solutions. [S23] Comparison with existing benchmarks. [S24] Table 1 compares CRAG with existing benchmarks for\nfactual question answering. [S25] Traditional QA benchmarks such as Natural Questions (NQ) [18],\nTriviaQA [16], MS MARCO [4], and QALD-10 [35] have advanced QA in the past decade but\nconsider only web retrieved or KG retrieved contents, and do not adequately represent the diverse\nand dynamic challenges that RAG is facing. [S26] New benchmarks for LLM or RAG usually target certain\ncapabilities of the QA system. [S27] Researchers created benchmarks to evaluate how well the systems\ncan answer simple knowledge questions [23, 29, 30] and handle more advanced scenarios. [S28] These\ninclude answering questions with changing answers [36], integrating information from multiple\ndocuments [6], addressing multi-hop questions [33], and answering questions with long texts [26]. [S29] Moreover, traditional QA benchmarks usually adopt matching-based metrics such as ROUGE [21]\nor F1 to evaluate the quality of the responses [16, 18]. [S30] These metrics, although working well for\nextractive methods, are known to not perform very effectively for LLMs that generate free-form\nresponses [11]. [S31] Despite CRAG being smaller than MS MARCO and NQ, it offers several distinctive advantages:\ncomprehensive coverage, realistic testing with mock APIs, dynamic question handling, diverse fact\npopularity, extensive content beyond Wikipedia, and fast yet reliable evaluation. [S32] These features make\nCRAG a robust and versatile benchmark for testing RAG systems and broadly QA systems, providing\na shared testbed to evaluate how these systems handle real-world, dynamic, and diverse information\nretrieval and synthesis challenges for reliable LLM-based question answering.

[S2] The question types are listed in Table 2. [S3] We constructed the question-answer\npairs both from underlying KGs and web contents. [S4] QA pairs constructed from KGs. [S5] We constructed QA pairs from KGs by collecting a set of entities\nbased on publicly available data and then creating 600+ question templates based on selected entity\ntypes and relations. [S6] Next, we sampled entities with different popularities (head, torso and tail)\nfollowing [29] from the KGs to fill in the templates and generate the full question and answer. [S7] QA pairs constructed from web contents. [S8] We asked annotators to write down possible questions\nthat users may ask (e.g., \u201cmost popular action movies in 2023\u201d) and created QA pairs from the\ncorresponding web search results. [S9] Using the above methods, we collected 2,425 Web Questions and 1,984 KG Questions, with 661, 658,\nand 665 KG Questions containing head, torso, and tail entities respectively. [S10] Tables 3 and 4 summarize\nthe distribution of the questions across different dimensions. [S11] The size of each dimension slice (e.g.,\nfast-changing facts) allows us to get metrics with \u0103 5% margin-of-error (with 95% confidence level)\nfor most of the cases. [S12] The dynamism distribution roughly reflects the nature of the domain (e.g.,\nmuch more real-time questions for Finance than for other domains). [S13] See Appendix A.1.2 for the\ndefinition of the dynamism categories. [S14] 3.2 Contents for retrieval\n\nWe included two types of contents for retrieval to simulate the practical scenario for RAG: web search\nand KG search. [S15] Web search results. [S16] For each question, we used the question text as the search query and stored up\nto 50 HTML pages from the Brave search API [5]. [S17] See Table 8 in Appendix A.1.5 for an example. [S18] We estimated the web search recall with a heuristic-based method: first check whether the ground\ntruth answer URL was found among the pages; if not, decide whether the fact in the ground truths is\ncontained in the page snippet or content with an LLM. [S19] In particular, we pass the question, ground\ntruth, and the pages to Llama 3 70B Instruct and ask it to judge if the context is sufficient to answer\nthe question. [S20] 5\n\n\fFigure 2: For 85% of CRAG questions, the web search results are estimated to contain the ground\ntruth facts. [S21] The curve shows that the retrieval recall grows sharply at the beginning and flattens out\nlater on. [S22] Figure 2 shows the estimated web search recall curve for all CRAG questions, with an overall recall\nof 85% when using all 50 pages. [S23] It reflects multiple advantages of the benchmark by design. [S24] First,\nthe recall curves are sharp at the beginning and flatten out later, and the recall for the top 5 pages is\nabout 69%. [S25] This is comparable to what we observe in practice when developing a RAG system. [S26] The\nnon-perfect coverage, especially for Task 1, allows us to test whether the RAG solutions admit \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know\u201d when the retrieval results do not contain the necessary information. [S27] Second, compared\nto the recall from web snippets, full web pages increase the recall by about 20%, emphasizing the\nimportance of extracting and understanding HTML contents. [S28] Moreover, the estimated web search\nrecall (50 web pages) is 93% for Web Questions and 74% for KG Questions, indicating significantly\nlower recall for KG questions than web questions. [S29] This aligns with our observations that web search\nrecall for torso and tail entities is typically lower, underlining the crucial role of leveraging KGs in\nTask 2 and 3. [S30] Mock KGs. [S31] We created mock KGs that contain publicly available KG data used to generate the\nquestions, randomly selected entities of the same type, and also \u201chard negative\u201d entities with similar\nnames (e.g., \u201cphantom\u201d for \u201cphantom of the opera\u201d). [S32] Mock APIs. [S33] We created mock APIs with pre-defined parameters to support structured search in the\nmock KGs. [S34] For example, for queries asking for stock prices, an example mock API is in the form of\nget_price_history(ticker). [S35] We collected snapshots of the KG and web search data concurrently while posing real-time and\nfast-changing questions. [S36] This approach ensures that we capture the \u201csnapshot\u201d of the information\nworld at the time of question answering. [S37] A RAG solution that performs well on the benchmark should\nalso be capable of reasoning over time and generalizing to evolving questions. [S38] In total, the resulting data contains 220K webpages, a KG of 2.6M entities, and 38 mock APIs. [S39] See\nTable 9 in the Appendix for a complete list of the mock APIs. [S40] 4 Metrics and Evaluation\n\nIn this section, we present the metrics for evaluating the RAG systems and briefly describe the 2024\nMeta KDD Cup challenge in Appendix A.2.3. [S41] 4.1 Metrics\n\nWe use a scoring method to assess the performance of RAG systems. [S42] For each question in the\nevaluation set, we first label the answer with perfect, acceptable, missing, or incorrect, according to\nthe following criteria. [S43] Perfect. [S44] The response correctly answers the user\u2019s question and contains no hallucinated content.

[S3] The response provides a useful answer to the user\u2019s question but may contain minor\nerrors that do not harm the usefulness of the answer. [S4] Missing. [S5] The response is \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t find ...\u201d, a system error such as an empty\nresponse, or a request from the system to clarify the original question. [S6] Incorrect. [S7] The response provides wrong or irrelevant information to answer the user\u2019s question. [S8] We use a scoring method with score 1, 0.5, 0, and \u00b41 for each perfect, acceptable, missing, and\nincorrect answer, respectively, where we penalize hallucinated answers and prefer missing answers to\nincorrect ones. [S9] We then define truthfulness as the average score from all examples in the evaluation\nset for a given RAG system. [S10] 4.2 Evaluation\n\nSimilar to previous work [37], we employ both human evaluation (human-eval) and model-based\nautomatic evaluation (auto-eval). [S11] In the former, we use manual grading to judge perfect, acceptable,\nmissing, and incorrect for each answer. [S12] In the latter, we merge perfect and acceptable, call it accurate,\nand use a three-way scoring system with 1, \u00b41, 0 for accurate, incorrect, and missing answers. [S13] We design a two-step method for automatic evaluation: if the answer matches the ground truth exactly,\nit is considered accurate; otherwise, we use LLMs to determine whether the response is accurate,\nincorrect, or missing. [S14] To avoid the self-preference problem [25], we use two LLM evaluators:\nChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-0125) [24] and Llama 3 (llama-3-70B-instruct) [2] and report the\naverage accurate, hallucination, missing rates, and truthfulness scores from the two models for each\nRAG system. [S15] Our offline experiment shows that this two-step method yields an average F1 score of\n94.7% for ChatGPT and 98.9% for Llama 3 compared to human-eval. [S16] See Appendix A.2.2 for more\ndetails. [S17] Test data split. [S18] We split the data randomly into validation (30%), public test (30%), and private\n(40%), and released the validation and public test sets (Appendix A.2.3). [S19] Participants of the KDD\nCup challenge can use the validation and public test sets to develop and test their models, and the\nsubmitted solutions were evaluated on the private test set. [S20] Future offline users of CRAG can use\nthe validation set for development, fine-tuning, and validation, and the public test set for testing and\nresult reporting. [S21] 5 Benchmarking\n\nIn this section, we present the performance of LLMs and RAG systems on CRAG, demonstrating\nthat CRAG has a reasonable level of difficulty and can help draw insights and show directions in\ndeveloping RAG techniques. [S22] 5.1 Straightforward RAG solutions\n\nExperiment setup: We started with running LLM-only solutions on the CRAG public test\nset with 1, 335 questions, using simple prompts that encourage brief answers and \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow\u201d answers when the confidence is low (Appendix A.3.1). [S23] We employed Llama 2 Chat\n(llama-2-7b-chat and llama-2-70b-chat) [34], Llama 3 Instruct (llama-3-8B-instruct and\nllama-3-70B-instruct) [2], Mixtral (Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) [15], Falcon (40B) [3],\nFLAN-T5 (FLAN-T5-XXL) [9], and GPT-4 Turbo (gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09) [1]. [S24] The web-only\nRAG solutions we evaluated (Task 1) used a fixed-length web context window (1K tokens for Falcon\nand FLAN-T5, 2K for Llama 2 Chat, and 4K for Llama 3 Instruct and GPT-4 Turbo); we concatenated\nwebpage snippets using the original order from the data as the reference text, until filling up the\nwindow (similar to [17, 23, 36]). [S25] Our KG-based solutions (Tasks 2, 3) additionally used a fixed-length\nKG context window (0.5K tokens for Falcon and FLAN-T5, 1K for Llama 2 Chat, and 2K for Llama\n3 Instruct and GPT-4 Turbo) to include the results from the mock APIs; we extracted the relevant\nquery entities using llama-3-8B-instruct with in-context learning (similar to [28]) detailed in\nAppendix A.3.1 and concatenated the results returned from all applicable mock APIs (based on the\nextracted entities), until filling up the window. [S26] We provide an extensive comparison of all LLMs\nin Appendix A.3.2 and focus on the best-performing LLMs (i.e., Llama 3 70B Instruct and GPT-4\nTurbo) in this section.

[S4] Table 5 shows the average evaluation results from the two auto-evaluators (ChatGPT and Llama 3) and\nillustrates that the CRAG benchmark is non-trivial. [S5] First, the best LLM-only solutions (GPT-4 Turbo)\nobtained an accuracy of only 34%, with truthfulness of 20%, showing a big room for improvement. [S6] Second, straightforward RAG solutions obtained up to 44% accuracy, showing that extra information\ndoes help answer more questions reliably. [S7] Interestingly, none of the RAG solutions obtain truthfulness\nhigher than 20%; this is because all RAG solutions introduce more hallucinations generated from\nirrelevant retrieval results, showing a big challenge in RAG\u2014How to judiciously use retrieval results\nwithout being distracted by retrieval noises? [S8] Third, we found that Task 2 truthfulness scores are\nhigher than Task 1, showing that the KG knowledge helps improve accuracy, with a similar or even\nlower hallucination rate, because the KG knowledge is typically brief but precise. [S9] Unfortunately, the\nimprovement is mediocre, showing a second challenge in RAG\u2014How to best leverage the power of\nKG data? [S10] Finally, the truthfulness for Task 3 are also higher than Task 2, because of better search\nranking (recall that Task 1 and 2 provide five pages randomly selected from the top-10 search results)\nand better search recall. [S11] In particular, we found that the ground truths of over 30% of questions are\navailable in the web retrieval results but are not included in the prompt due to the context window\nlimitation. [S12] This shows the importance of search ranking in RAG. [S13] Figure 3 shows the auto-eval results across the domain, dynamism, popularity, and question type\ndimension. [S14] The results reveal a lot of interesting observations and show that the CRAG benchmark\nallows more insightful conclusions. [S15] First, it shows which slices of the benchmark are harder. [S16] For\nexample, we found much lower RAG truthfulness on the Finance and Sports domains, for real-\n\n8\n\nFinanceSportsMusicMovieOpen10010203040-4-131338-13619194040192623-109303135(a) DomainReal-timeFast-changingSlow-changingStatic100102030-1-7-148-15-149250-1524-5-81528(b) DynamismWebHeadTorsoTail05101520-16-101612110152111818171814(c) PopularitySimpleSimple w.

[S24] Second, it shows where it is harder to leverage retrieval\nresults. [S25] Take the popularity slices as an example, we observed that GPT-4 Turbo\u2019s truthfulness\ndropped from head (21%) to torso (11%) to tail (8%), consistent with past observations [29]; however,\nthe straightforward RAG solution based on GPT-4 Turbo improved QA quality regarding torso\n(+7%) and tail entities (+6%) but lowered the quality regarding head (-4%). [S26] Finally, although\nour goal is not to compare different LLMs, the different dimensions allow us to understand the\nstrengths and weaknesses of each method. [S27] For example, although the RAG system based on Llama\n3 70B Instruct has a lower overall truthfulness score than the one based on GPT-4 Turbo, it has a\nsimilar or slightly higher truthfulness in answering simple and comparison questions, whereas much\nlower truthfulness in answering set and post-processing questions, suggesting investigations on the\nreasoning capabilities. [S28] 5.2 State-of-the-art industry solutions\n\nNext, we evaluated industry state-of-the-art (SOTA) RAG solutions on CRAG public test set. [S29] We\nselected five RAG systems built upon SOTA LLMs and search engines, queried them with CRAG\nquestions, collected the responses, and applied manual grading (details in Appendix A.4). [S30] In addition, we applied traffic weights to the questions to understand the solutions in real-world use\ncases. [S31] The traffic weights reflect the frequency of each question type, as defined in Table 2, in real\nQA traffic. [S32] We gave the same weights to all domains and reported the macro average across domains. [S33] This is because we have observed quite different domain-level distributions in different use cases, but\nhave been observing similar distributions at the query-type level."

[S2] We gave the same weights to all domains and reported the macro average across domains. [S3] This is because we have observed quite different domain-level distributions in different use cases, but\nhave been observing similar distributions at the query-type level. [S4] Table 6 and Figure 4 show the overall performance of the SOTA systems and their performance\nacross different dimensions. [S5] The evaluation results confirm our belief that the CRAG benchmark\nreveals interesting insights and shows room for improvement for existing RAG solutions. [S6] First,\nthe results from SOTA solutions achieve much better truthfulness (highest 51%) compared to the\nstraightforward solutions. [S7] However, the hallucination rate ranges from 16% to 25%, so the answers\nare still not trustworthy. [S8] Note that the truthfulness scores between the SOTA solutions and the\nstraightforward solutions are not completely comparable, as they have different accesses to retrieval\ncontents (Appendix A.3 and A.4.1), and the former used auto-eval, while the latter used human-eval;\nhowever, the trend is valid. [S9] Second, we observed very different latency, ranging from 3.4s to 11.6s,\nreflecting the different design options in trading off latency and quality; for example, Copilot Pro\nhas the highest truthfulness, but meanwhile highest latency, whereas Meta SG [10] has mid-tier\ntruthfulness but lowest latency. [S10] (See Appendix A.4.2 for additional results and how we measured\nlatency.) Third, most difficult slices we see in the straightforward solutions remain to be difficult for\nSOTA solutions: real-time and fast-changing queries, and questions regarding torso and tail entities,\nshowing the improvement needed for handling retrieval noises when the system relies on retrieval\nresults to answer the question; as another example, we see lower truthfulness for queries requiring\naggregation, multi-hop reasoning or post-processing, showing the improvement space for reasoning\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 4: SOTA systems human-eval truthfulness scores (in percentage) across different dimensions. [S11] in question answering. [S12] Last, truthfulness on set and false premise questions improved significantly\nin the SOTA solutions compared to the straightforward solutions, showing advancement in RAG\nsystems in providing accurate and complete set answers and detecting false premises. [S13] 6 Conclusion\n\nThis paper proposes CRAG, a rich and comprehensive benchmark designed to advance research in\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG). [S14] With detailed empirical studies, CRAG reviewed gaps in\nexisting RAG solutions and provided valuable insights for future improvement. [S15] We plan to continue\nimproving and expanding the benchmark for multi-lingual questions, multi-modal questions, multi-\nturn conversations, etc., to ensure CRAG stays at the forefront to push RAG research, adapts to\nemerging challenges, and evolves for new research needs.

[S127] In\n\nNeurIPS, 2024. [S128] 12\n\n\fA Appendix\n\nA.1 Dataset\n\nA.1.1 Constructing QA pairs from KGs\n\nWe first collected a set of entities based on publicly available data. [S129] Then we created question-answer\npairs in three steps for Simple static and dynamic questions. [S130] Step 1. [S131] For each domain, we first selected an entity type and a meaningful relation pe, rq and created\na question template. [S132] For example, for (music artist, first album), we create a template \u201cwhat is the\nfirst album of [music artist]?\u201d. [S133] Step 2. [S134] We then sampled entities from the KGs to fill in the templates and generate the full question. [S135] We adopted the method described in [29] and sampled entities of top, middle, and bottom popularity. [S136] We defined popularity based on heuristics for each entity type and created an equal number of\nquestions for each bucket. [S137] Step 3. [S138] Last, we took the associated attribute values as the answer to the question to create question-\nanswer pairs. [S139] We created the Comparison, Aggregation, Set, Post-processing, and False-premise questions in a\nsimilar way but 1) made sure the template allows for crisp and deterministic answers and 2) sampled\nthe subject entities that fit the question. [S140] We used heuristics to select entity types for these question\ncategories. [S141] Finally, we created multi-hop questions in three steps, similar to those described in [31]. [S142] We first\nsampled an entity e1 from the KG and selected two relation triplets following a two-hop path:\npe1, r1, e2q and pe1, r2, e3q. [S143] We then created a question template describing the path. [S144] For example,\nfor path (company1, is_parent, company2) followed by (company1, ceo, person), we created the\ntemplate \"who is the CEO of the parent company of [company2]?\". [S145] The answer to the new question\nwill be e3 in the second triplet. [S146] A.1.2 Definition of dynamism categories\n\nTable 7: Definition of dynamism categories.

[S152] Ask annotators to write down a list of questions that could possibly be answered by web\nsearch based on a general guideline (e.g., \u201cwhat is the most popular action movie in 2023?\u201d). [S153] Step 2. [S154] Generate the web search results to answer the question. [S155] Step 3. [S156] Finally, annotators reviewed the web search results to determine the ground truth answers to\nthe questions: 1) If the search results successfully provided the necessary information, annotators\nrecorded the ground truth answer text and the URL associated with it based on the retrieved content. [S157] Note that the answer is determined by the query_time at which the web search happened, especially\nfor the Fast-changing and Real-time questions. [S158] 2) Otherwise, annotators conducted further web\nsearches to document the correct answers. [S159] 13\n\n\fBesides the QA pairs, the annotators will also provide labels for the domain, dynamism, question\ntypes, and an answer URL (a URL that contains the answer to the question) for Web Questions. [S160] A.1.4 Validation for the QA pairs\n\nWe conducted two phases of dataset validation with our in-house Linguist team. [S161] Phase 1. [S162] Question and meta-label validation. [S163] After the initial round of QA pair generation, an\naudit session was conducted, where expert annotators reviewed the question template, questions,\nand meta-labels (domain, question type, etc), applying edits as necessary with 2x human review\n(agreement rate 90%`). [S164] All problematic questions (e.g., a wrong false-premise question) were\nrevised, and all conflicting labels were resolved by a third more experienced auditor."

[S5] Answer validation. [S6] To ensure the answers in the benchmark are correct, we further\nconducted an auditing process for all the answers. [S7] For the web questions, an annotation team\nreviewed each question and conducted an extensive search to make sure the answer is factually\ncorrect and includes comprehensive information (such as for set questions) with 2x human review\n(agreement rate 90%`). [S8] A third more experienced auditor then reviewed all conflicting answers and\nprovided a resolution. [S9] For the KG questions, a team of five engineers carefully checked the questions\nand queried the mock APIs manually to validate the answers. [S10] This step resulted in a 5% answer\ncorrection. [S11] In both phases, we paid special attention to examples where the straightforward solutions output\ndifferent answers from the ground truth answers and asked the auditing team to double-check those\nexamples.

[S15] CRAG provides both structured (through mock KGs) and unstructured (web search results) informa-\ntion to test the effectiveness of RAG systems in leveraging a diverse range of available information. [S16] First, for each question in the benchmark, CRAG provides up to 50 web search results from a real-\nworld search engine\u2014the Brave Search API [5]. [S17] Different from existing benchmarks that use snippets\nor selected text chunks [4, 6], CRAG provides full HTML pages, containing more information and\npotentially more noises as in a realistic setting. [S18] Second, CRAG provides mock KG search APIs to test\nstructured search for RAG. [S19] The mock KGs, though much smaller in size, contain both information\nnecessary to answer a subset of questions in the benchmark and noises that have similar entity or\nattribute names, again simulating real settings. [S20] Our mock KGs contain about 2.6M entities and have\na signal-to-noise ratio of less than 1/30. [S21] 14\n\n\fTable 9: Mock APIs and Descriptions.

[S26] A.2 Evaluation\n\nA.2.1 Human evaluation\n\nWe run human evaluation to score each answer with respect to the metrics defined in Section 4.1. [S27] We score each perfect, acceptable, missing, or incorrect answer with a score sp, sa, sm, and sin,\nrespectively and define truthfulnessh as the score of the answer by setting sp \u201c 1, sa \u201c 0.5, sm \u201c 0,\nand sin \u201c \u00b41. [S28] We then compute the average truthfulness for all examples in the evaluation set as the\ntruthfulness score for the RAG solution. [S29] Human-eval instructions. [S30] The human-eval instructions are as follows. [S31] Given a query, a query day and time at which the query was made, the chatbot\u2019s response, grade the\naccuracy for the response according to the criteria below:\nUsing an external search engine, please evaluate the factual accuracy of the response based on the\ngrading rubric below. [S32] An accurate answer should be factually correct and provide useful information\nto answer the user\u2019s question. [S33] \u2022 Accuracy = 0 (Missing). [S34] It covers the following situations. [S35] There is no response. [S36] There is a\nfailure to provide a response to the request (e.g. [S37] \u201cI\u2019m sorry . [S38] . [S39] . [S40] . [S41] . [S42] . [S43] , I can\u2019t do . [S44] .

[S48] . [S49] . [S50] \u201d The response fails to answer and asks\nfollow-up questions. [S51] \u2022 Accuracy = 1 (Incorrect). [S52] It covers the following situations.

[S61] The response is\notherwise a total structural/functional failure and does not contain sufficient well-formed\ncontent that can be used to determine accuracy\n\n\u2022 Accuracy = 2 (Acceptable). [S62] It covers the following situations. [S63] The answer is acceptably\ncorrect and relevant to the user\u2019s request, but may miss some information, i.e. [S64] accurate but\nnot complete, or mostly accurate with minor issues. [S65] The answer may contain some minor\nhallucination that doesn\u2019t significantly alter the overall meaning. [S66] \u201cMinor hallucination\u201d\nmeans the answer addressed the user\u2019s question but might be off on some additional details. [S67] The rule of thumb is to see if the answer serves the purpose of the user\u2019s question, and\nwhether the hallucination could mislead the users on what they were asking. [S68] \u2022 Accuracy = 3 (Accurate). [S69] The answer is factually correct, contains all the relevant informa-\ntion requested, responds appropriately to the query, and does not contain any hallucination. [S70] We requested two human graders to grade each question (agreement rate 94%), and when there is a\nconflict, a third more experienced grader will resolve it. [S71] A.2.2 Automatic evaluation\n\nIn auto-eval, we merge perfect and acceptable as accurate and consider only three scores: 1 for\naccurate, 0 for missing, and -1 for incorrect. [S72] The truthfulnessa is calculated by the average\ntruthfulness for all the examples in the evaluation set, and is effectively\n\naccuracy \u00b4 hallucination,\n\nwhere accuracy, hallucination, and missing are the percentage of accurate, incorrect, and missing\nanswers in the test set. [S73] These score choices penalize incorrect answers, award correct, and assign a\nvalue of 0 to missing answers. [S74] Auto-evaluators. [S75] We computed the accuracy and F1 for the two auto-evaluators for the accurate,\nincorrect, and missing examples in the public test set, respectively. [S76] Here, we considered human-eval\nlabels as the ground truth. [S77] Table 10 shows both models attain reasonable accuracy and F1 scores as\nan evaluator compared to human evaluation.

[S20] Note that the original Query Time and the provided retrieval results\nin CRAG are not used in this setting. [S21] We simply test the questions and ask human graders to grade\nthe responses based on when the query was made to the SOTA system. [S22] We called Copilot Pro,\nGemini Advanced, and ChatGPT Plus through their web interfaces and Perplexity.ai through its API. [S23] Meta SG, designed as a smart glasses (SG) assistant, includes default on-device components such as\nAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS), which are not typically enabled\nby default in other systems. [S24] To ensure a fair comparison, we excluded these on-device components,\n\n19\n\n\fensuring that answer quality was not affected. [S25] We called each system on the following dates in\nPacific Time: 05/12/2024\u201e05/16/2024 (Copilot Pro), 05/20/2024\u201e05/28/2024 (Gemini Advanced),\n05/27/2024\u201e06/02/2024 (ChatGPT Plus), 05/15/2024\u201e05/16/2024 (Perplexity.ai), and 07/02/2024\n(Meta SG). [S26] We set the conversation style to \u201cPrecise\u201d when calling Copilot Pro and the temperature\nto 0 when calling Perplexity.ai. [S27] We select GPT-4o and llama-3-sonar-large-32k-online as the\nbase LLM when calling ChatGPT Plus and Perplexity.ai, respectively. [S28] A.4.2 Latency\n\nWe quantified the latency by calculating the time difference between the timestamp of the query\nsubmission to the system and the timestamp when the complete response was received. [S29] The latency of Perplexity.ai measured via API call is 2,455ms. [S30] Since latency measured by API call\nand web interface interactions are not directly comparable, we further called Perplexity.ai through\nits web interface and reported the latency under this setting in Table 6. [S31] Note that this latency may\nnot correspond to the accuracy numbers from the API calls. [S32] For Meta SG, we estimated a latency\ncomparable to other web interface interactions by excluding on-device components such as ASR and\nTTS from the overall end-to-end latency measurement.

[S3] A.5 Limitations\n\nThe three tasks in our benchmark do not directly evaluate the construction of a first-stage retrieval\ncandidate pool, a demanding retrieval task in its own right. [S4] This design decision ensures that the\ncompetition remains both challenging and achievable within the KDD Cup\u2019s required three-month\ntimeframe. [S5] Despite the limitation, users of our dataset have the option to use the union of all 220K\nweb pages as a corpus to build a retriever.
