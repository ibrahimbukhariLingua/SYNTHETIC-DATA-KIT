  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Ekart in 3-5 sentences. Let me read through the content again to make sure I get the main points.\n\nThe document starts by introducing Ekart as an Indian courier service under Flipkart, based in Bangalore. It mentions that it's a subsidiary of Flipkart and run by Instakart. Then there's data about 10 million shipments a month and 85% of Flipkart's products being shipped by Ekart as of 2015. There's also a mention of Klick2Shop investing a large amount in 2017. The background section says Ekart was taken over by Flipkart from WS Retail Services and that they introduced 24/7 locker services in stores and supermarkets.\n\nSo the main topics are: Ekart's role as a Flipkart subsidiary, its logistics operations, key statistics, investment, and innovations like locker services. I need to condense this into a concise summary. Make sure to include the parent company, headquarters, shipment numbers, investment details, and the locker service innovation. Avoid minor details like the exact investment amount unless it's crucial. Also, check if the key concepts are covered: logistics services, partnership with Flipkart, growth metrics, and unique services. Let me structure that into a few sentences without being too wordy.\n</think>\n\nEkart is an Indian logistics and courier company, headquartered in Bangalore and operated by Instakart services as a subsidiary of Flipkart Pvt. Ltd. It handles approximately 10 million shipments monthly, having delivered 85% of Flipkart's products as of 2015. The company received a significant investment of Rs.1641 crore from Singapore-based Klick2Shop Logistics in 2017. Ekart pioneered 24/7 locker services in stores and supermarkets, enhancing delivery convenience, and was acquired by Flipkart from WS Retail Services. Its role underscores its critical support for Flipkart's e-commerce operations through efficient logistics solutions.",
