  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Wefunder in 3-5 sentences. Let me read through the provided text again.\n\nThe main points are: Wefunder is an online service for individual investors to crowdfund startups. It uses a provision from the 2012 JOBS Act allowing unaccredited investors to buy equity in early-stage private companies. Founded in 2012 by Nick Tommarello, Mike Norman, and Greg Belote, with Y Combinator's backing. The foundation is that anyone should be able to invest regardless of wealth.\n\nSo the key concepts are the service's purpose, the JOBS Act provision, the founders, Y Combinator, and the mission of inclusive investing. I need to make sure each sentence covers these elements without getting too detailed. Let me check if there's any other info. The citation note is there, but maybe not necessary in the summary. Also, the term \"unaccredited investors\" is important. I should mention that. Let me structure it: first sentence introduces Wefunder and its purpose. Second sentence about the JOBS Act. Third about the founders and Y Combinator. Fourth about the mission. Maybe combine some parts to keep it concise. Avoid repetition. Make sure it's 3-5 sentences. Let me try a draft.\n</think>\n\nWefunder is an online platform enabling individual investors to crowdfund early-stage startups by purchasing equity, leveraging a 2012 JOBS Act provision that allows unaccredited investors to participate. Founded in 2012 by Nick Tommarello, Mike Norman, and Greg Belote, the company was supported by Y Combinator and aims to democratize investment opportunities. Its core mission is to make startup investing accessible to all, regardless of wealth, by breaking down traditional barriers to entry. The platform emphasizes inclusivity, enabling broader public participation in private company growth.",
