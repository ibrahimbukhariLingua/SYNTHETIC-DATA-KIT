  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Lendico in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document mentions that Lendico is a multinational peer-to-peer lending platform founded in 2013 by Rocket Internet. It was acquired by ING in 2018 and operates as a subsidiary. The company expanded to several countries like Germany, Spain, Poland, etc. Their business model connects borrowers and investors, offering personal and SME loans with interest rates based on credit scores. They use online technology, have a low approval rate, and were recognized as a top credit marketplace.\n\nI should highlight the main points: founding, acquisition, expansion, business model, and key features like online operations and credit-based interest rates. Also note the subsidiary status after ING's takeover and the Brazil branch being independent. Need to keep it concise, making sure each sentence covers a distinct aspect without too much detail.\n</think>\n\nLendico is a multinational peer-to-peer lending platform founded in 2013 by Rocket Internet, operating as a subsidiary of Dutch bank ING Groep after its 2018 acquisition. It connects borrowers and investors globally, offering personal and SME loans with interest rates determined by creditworthiness, and expanded to markets like Germany, Spain, Brazil, and others. The company relies on proprietary online technology to streamline lending, with a low approval rate (10% of applications) and a focus on credit scoring and risk assessment. Lendico Brazil remains independent from Lendico Global Services, and the platform has been recognized as a leading credit marketplace.",

[S9] Inspired by the business model of the US peer-to-peer lending platform Lending Club and UK based company Zopa, Lendico is a marketplace that enables the link between borrowers and investors. [S10] During the first 20 months, the company established itself in Austria, Brazil, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and South Africa, replicating the expansion plan usually used by its creator, Rocket Internet. [S11] ## Business Model\n\nThe loans are personal loans or SME loans and range between €1,000 - €150,000 in Germany. [S12] The interest fee is calculated on the basis of the borrower’s credit score, credit history, desired loan amount and the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio. [S13] Lendico determines whether the borrower is creditworthy and assigns to its approved loans a credit grade that determines the payable interest rate and the fees. [S14] The loan period can range between 1 and 5 years and be repaid at any time. [S15] Only 10% of applications are received on the platform. [S16] Lendico operates completely online with no branch network and relies on proprietary technology to reduce costs and optimize the handling of loan applications. [S17] Lendico has repeatedly been nominated as best credit marketplace.

      "reasoning": "The passage states in [S13] that Lendico assigns a credit grade to approved loans, which 'determines the payable interest rate and the fees.'
