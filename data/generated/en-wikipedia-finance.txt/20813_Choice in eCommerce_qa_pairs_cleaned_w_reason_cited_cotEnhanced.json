  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about \"Choice in eCommerce\" in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main topic is the initiative called \"Choice in eCommerce,\" which is led by European online retailers. Their goal is to promote unrestricted trade and innovation. The founder is Oliver Prothmann, who also runs a tool called chartixx. \n\nThe history section mentions it was founded in 2013 in Berlin by online retailers. They were upset about sales bans and restrictions from manufacturers, which they felt limited their ability to compete on platforms like Amazon, eBay, and Rakuten. The document also notes that online sales in Europe in 2012 were 311.6 billion Euros, and online trade created up to two million jobs. \n\nIn 2013, they started a petition for free trade, collected 14,341 signatures, and presented it to Olli Rehn, a European Commission official. \n\nSo the key points are: the initiative's purpose, its origin, the problem they faced (sales bans), the impact of online trade, and their actions (petition). I need to condense this into a concise summary, making sure to include the main topic, key concepts like the initiative's goals, the problem they addressed, and their actions. I should avoid minor details like the exact date of the petition submission unless it's crucial. Also, mention the founder and the platforms they're involved with. Let me check if I have all the essential elements. Yes, that should cover it.\n</think>\n\nThe **Choice in eCommerce** initiative, launched in 2013 by European online retailers, advocates for unrestricted trade and innovation by challenging sales restrictions imposed by manufacturers. Founded in Berlin by retailers feeling marginalized by platform limitations on Amazon, eBay, and Rakuten, the group aimed to ensure fair competition and consumer choice. The initiative highlighted the economic impact of online trade, noting 2012 sales of â‚¬311.6 billion and up to two million jobs created in Europe. In 2013, it collected 14,341 signatures through a petition to the European Commission, urging policy reforms to support open digital markets. Led by Oliver Prothmann, the effort emphasizes the importance of multi-channel retailing and regulatory fairness for e-commerce growth.",
