  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Bruce S. Raynor in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.\n\nThe document starts by introducing Raynor as an American labor union executive with various roles in different unions like SEIU, Workers United, UNITE HERE, and his involvement with the Change to Win Federation. He's also part of the Cornell Board and other organizations. Then it mentions his resignation in 2011 and current roles. \n\nNext, there's a section on his work as a union organizer, starting in 1973, his involvement in organizing J.P. Stevens, which was in the movie \"Norma Rae.\" He organized many workers in the South, worked with several companies, and his education at Cornell. \n\nThen there's info about his resignation from UNITE HERE, moving to Workers United, and later resigning from SEIU. The family section mentions his parents, brother, and personal life.\n\nThe main topic here is Bruce Raynor's career in labor unions, his key roles, and his contributions. The key concepts are his leadership in various unions, his organizing efforts, significant campaigns, and his transition to consulting. I need to highlight his positions, the unions he was part of, his notable campaigns, and his later career moves. Also, mention his education and family briefly if needed, but focus on the main points. Avoid minor details like the exact number of workers unless they're significant. Make sure to keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Let me check if I missed any important points. The summary should capture his roles, the impact of his organizing, and his current status. Okay, time to put it all together.\n</think>\n\nBruce S. Raynor is a prominent American labor union leader who held key roles in organizations like the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), UNITE HERE, and Workers United, as well as leadership positions in union-affiliated financial institutions. He gained recognition for his grassroots organizing efforts in the 1970s, including the successful campaign to unionize J.P. Stevens, dramatized in the film *Norma Rae*, and for organizing thousands of Southern textile workers. Raynor later navigated union mergers and disputes, eventually transitioning to a consulting career while remaining involved in labor advocacy through the Sidney Hillman Foundation. His career reflects a lifelong commitment to labor rights, community-based organizing, and institutional leadership in the U.S. labor movement.",
