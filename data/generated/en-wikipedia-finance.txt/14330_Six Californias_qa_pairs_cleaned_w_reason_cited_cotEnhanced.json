  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Six Californias initiative in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the document to understand the main points.\n\nThe document explains that Six Californias was a 2013 proposal by Tim Draper to split California into six states. It failed to get enough signatures for the 2016 ballot. The key points are the reasons behind the proposal, the process, the opposition, and the outcome. \n\nDraper's reasoning was that California is too large and ungovernable, leading to inefficiency. The proposal would have required approval from the state legislature and Congress, as per the Constitution. The states were named Jefferson, North California, etc., each with different populations. \n\nOpponents argued it was a waste of resources and a political move to separate wealthy areas. The ballot process had issues with signature validation, leading to its failure. There was also a subsequent attempt in 2017 called Cal 3, which was blocked by the court.\n\nI need to make sure the summary includes the main topic (the proposal to split California), key concepts like the failure due to signatures, Draper's motivations, the constitutional requirements, opposition arguments, and the subsequent attempt. Keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Avoid too many details but hit the essentials.\n</think>\n\nThe **Six Californias** initiative, proposed by Tim Draper in 2013, aimed to split California into six smaller states to address perceived governance inefficiencies, but it failed to qualify for the 2016 ballot due to insufficient valid signatures. The plan, which outlined states like Silicon Valley and Jefferson, required congressional and state legislative approval under the U.S. Constitution, but opponents criticized it as a costly, politically motivated effort to segregate wealthier regions. Despite Draper's claims of improving governance, critics argued it would destabilize the state's economy, create bureaucratic challenges, and dilute Democratic influence. A subsequent 2017 attempt, **Cal 3**, also faced legal hurdles, highlighting the proposal's ongoing controversy and constitutional complexities.",

[S3] It failed to qualify as a California ballot measure for the 2016 state elections due to receiving insufficient signatures. [S4] Venture capitalist Tim Draper launched the measure in December 2013. [S5] He spent in excess of $5 million trying to qualify the proposition for the ballot, with nearly $450,000 for political consultants. [S6] Had the measure passed, it would not have legally split California immediately; consent would eventually need to be given by both the California State Legislature and the U.S. [S7] Congress to admit the new states to the union per Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. [S8] Constitution. [S9] Rather, the measure would have established several procedures within the state government and its 58 counties to prepare California for the proposed split, and instructed the Governor of California to submit the state-splitting proposal to Congress. [S10] The proposed states would have been named Jefferson, North California, Silicon Valley, Central California, West California, and South California. [S11] Draper's stated reasoning for the proposal was that the state is too large and ungovernable, and he therefore wanted to split California to produce six smaller and more efficient state governments. [S12] Opponents argued that it would have been a waste of money and resources to split California and create these new governments. [S13] Critics also charged that this was a money and political power grab designed to separate California's higher-income communities from lower-income areas, and to diminish the state's reliability as a predominantly Democratic Party-supporting \"blue state\". [S14] ## Background\n\nArticle IV, Section 3 of the U.S. [S15] Constitution outlines the procedure for the admission of new U.S. [S16] states. [S17] It reads:\n\n> New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress. [S18] There are several precedents for the partition of states:\n\n* Vermont, admitted in 1791, was created from territory to which a disputed claim was asserted by New York. [S19] (It had formerly also been claimed by New Hampshire, but that claim had been given up in 1782. [S20] Vermont had already been under a de facto separate government for over a decade.) New York's legislature consented in 1790. [S21] * Kentucky split from Virginia in 1792. [S22] Virginia's legislature consented to the partition when the Articles of Confederation were still in effect, but then the new Constitution of the United States superseded the Articles and the legislature's consent was passed again. [S23] * North Carolina ceded territory to the federal government which became the Southwest Territory and five years later in 1796 became the state of Tennessee;\n* Georgia ceded land that later became part of Alabama. [S24] Two instances were a result of slavery:\n\n* The 1820 Missouri Compromise balanced the number of free and slave states by splitting Maine from Massachusetts in 1820 and admitting Missouri in 1821. [S25] However, the partition of Maine from Massachusetts had been proposed well over three decades earlier for reasons other than slavery. [S26] * West Virginia was admitted to the U.S. [S27] as a separate state in 1863 when the Union-loyal Restored Government of Virginia broke from Virginia after Virginia joined the Confederate States of America in 1861, though most of the new state's counties had in fact supported secession. [S28] California has been the subject of more than 220 proposals to divide it into multiple states, including at least 27 serious proposals. [S29] Several of these attempts proposed the creation of a State of Jefferson that would span the contiguous, mostly rural area of southern Oregon and northern California.

[S4] California Secretary of State Debra Bowen approved Draper to begin collecting petition signatures in February 2014. [S5] The petition needed to submit sufficient valid signatures of registered California voters by July 18, 2014, to qualify as a November election ballot proposition. [S6] As the petition deadline drew closer, Draper suggested that the initiative would be postponed to 2016, since that would allow more time to educate the public on the initiative. [S7] On July 14, Draper announced that the proposal received 1.3 million signatures, enough to qualify for the ballot, and began submitting them to elections officials. [S8] Had sufficient signatures been verified, per California law, it would have qualified for the November 2016 state ballot. [S9] On September 12, 2014, California state election officials announced that based on random sampling of the submitted signatures, only an estimated 752,685 signatures were valid, which was insufficient not only to qualify the initiative for the ballot, but also to trigger a complete verification of all submitted signatures. [S10] These estimated valid signatures were 66.15% of the 1,137,844 submitted signatures. [S11] At least 807,615 signatures, 70.98% of the submitted signatures, had to be valid for the measure to qualify for the ballot. [S12] At least 767,235 signatures, 67.43% of the submitted signatures, had to be estimated to be valid in order for the petition to qualify for a second mandatory phase to review all of the submitted signatures, not just random samples. [S13] Also on September 12, 2014, the campaign announced its intent to \"... [S14] conduct a review of the signatures determined to be invalid by the registrars in several counties to determine if they were in fact valid signatures.\" To qualify for a full check of all signatures in all fifty-eight counties, the review must find about 450 wrongly invalidated signatures among those submitted in the fifteen counties that sampled 3% of the total signatures submitted in each of those fifteen counties. [S15] As of November 17, 2014, the campaign has not updated its web site with information about the results of their review of the supposedly invalid signatures. [S16] Opponents of the initiative filed a complaint with Secretary of State Debra Bowen on July 17, 2014, asking her office to investigate allegations of voter fraud. [S17] The complaint, filed on behalf of the OneCalifornia committee formally opposing the Six Californias initiative, follows reports that signature gatherers for Six Californias claimed that those who signed \"would be opposing the Attorney General of California's intention to split the state into six states\" – the exact opposite of the petitions intentions. [S18] Signature gathering for Six Californias was carried out by Arno Political Consultants. [S19] The campaign for Six Californias also paid $51,000 to Crowds on Demand, a service that sends paid actors to form crowds at gatherings such as political rallies. [S20] Organizers for Six Californias stated Crowds on Demand provided personnel for signature gathering. [S21] ## Measure details\n\nThe measure outlined the proposed new states, then established several procedures within the state government and all the counties to prepare California for the proposed split.

[S11] At least 807,615 signatures, 70.98% of the submitted signatures, had to be valid for the measure to qualify for the ballot. [S12] At least 767,235 signatures, 67.43% of the submitted signatures, had to be estimated to be valid in order for the petition to qualify for a second mandatory phase to review all of the submitted signatures, not just random samples. [S13] Also on September 12, 2014, the campaign announced its intent to \"... [S14] conduct a review of the signatures determined to be invalid by the registrars in several counties to determine if they were in fact valid signatures.\" To qualify for a full check of all signatures in all fifty-eight counties, the review must find about 450 wrongly invalidated signatures among those submitted in the fifteen counties that sampled 3% of the total signatures submitted in each of those fifteen counties. [S15] As of November 17, 2014, the campaign has not updated its web site with information about the results of their review of the supposedly invalid signatures. [S16] Opponents of the initiative filed a complaint with Secretary of State Debra Bowen on July 17, 2014, asking her office to investigate allegations of voter fraud. [S17] The complaint, filed on behalf of the OneCalifornia committee formally opposing the Six Californias initiative, follows reports that signature gatherers for Six Californias claimed that those who signed \"would be opposing the Attorney General of California's intention to split the state into six states\" – the exact opposite of the petitions intentions. [S18] Signature gathering for Six Californias was carried out by Arno Political Consultants. [S19] The campaign for Six Californias also paid $51,000 to Crowds on Demand, a service that sends paid actors to form crowds at gatherings such as political rallies.

[S2] Several of these attempts proposed the creation of a State of Jefferson that would span the contiguous, mostly rural area of southern Oregon and northern California. [S3] ## Ballot qualification process\n\nSix Californias was introduced in December 2013 by Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper. [S4] California Secretary of State Debra Bowen approved Draper to begin collecting petition signatures in February 2014. [S5] The petition needed to submit sufficient valid signatures of registered California voters by July 18, 2014, to qualify as a November election ballot proposition. [S6] As the petition deadline drew closer, Draper suggested that the initiative would be postponed to 2016, since that would allow more time to educate the public on the initiative. [S7] On July 14, Draper announced that the proposal received 1.3 million signatures, enough to qualify for the ballot, and began submitting them to elections officials. [S8] Had sufficient signatures been verified, per California law, it would have qualified for the November 2016 state ballot.

[S7] North California would have consisted of thirteen counties: Amador, El Dorado, Marin, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Sacramento, Sierra, Solano, Sonoma, Sutter, Yolo, and Yuba. [S8] #### Silicon Valley\n\nThe state of Silicon Valley would have spanned the coastline from San Francisco to Monterey. [S9] It would have consisted of eight counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Monterey, San Benito, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz. [S10] #### Central California\n\nThe state of Central California would have been between Silicon Valley and Nevada. [S11] It would have consisted of the fourteen counties north of Los Angeles and south of Sacramento: Alpine, Calaveras, Fresno, Inyo, Kern, Kings, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Mono, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Tulare, and Tuolumne. [S12] #### West California\n\nThe state of West California would have been south of Silicon Valley and Central California, and west of the current San Bernardino County. [S13] It would have consisted of four counties: Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. [S14] #### South California\n\nThe state of South California would have been made up of the southernmost part of the state, bordering Mexico and Arizona. [S15] It would have consisted of five counties: Imperial, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego. [S16] ### State-splitting process and other procedures\n\nThe above division was not set in stone.

[S6] ### Opposition\n\nOneCalifornia, a bi-partisan committee to oppose the Six Californias ballot proposal, was formed in April 2014. [S7] It is co-chaired by Joe Rodota, former Cabinet Secretary for Governor Pete Wilson; and Steven Maviglio, former Press Secretary to Governor Gray Davis. [S8] The committee suggested that the initiative was damaging the state's image in the world economy. [S9] Rodota stated: \"Every day this measure marches its way toward the ballot it damages the California brand as the nation's economic powerhouse. [S10] It has negative implications that could cost California's businesses and taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.\" In an opinion piece in the *U-T San Diego*, Maviglio and Rodota wrote that if the measure passes, it \"will set in motion the most bureaucratic, costly, paper-pushing process in our history ... [S11] we'd spend years doing nothing more than rewriting laws, duplicating government offices, and spending billions of dollars unnecessarily.\" Furthermore, that it could increase the lobbying industry sixfold in California \"to deal with the flood of open questions\", and would be a burden on California businesses due to the increase of federal regulations regarding interstate commerce. [S12] The segregation of the incomes and tax bases led to criticism that the proposal is merely a money and political power grab for Silicon Valley and California's other wealthy areas. [S13] Phillip Bump of the *Washington Post* wrote that \"this entire plan is really about creating Silicon Valley as its own state. [S14] Therefore Silicon Valley gets to be a state called 'Silicon Valley,' and it gets to make its politics and its money more dense, and everyone in the idyllic dream of Silicon Valley gets to be happy.\"\n\nBrendan Nyhan said that the idea would be unlikely to pass Congress due to disruption it would cause in the political balance of the U.S. [S15] Senate, as well as other sticking points. [S16] Opponents said that the initiative was a thinly disguised Republican power play aimed at diminishing the electoral votes that have historically gone to Democrats in California. [S17] In a survey of the California congressional delegation, *The Hill* found that the Democrats opposed the proposition, while the Republicans were generally divided. [S18] Thus, a couple of political experts countered that the measure would not get the approval of all the parties needed; the voters would not necessarily wish to break up the state with the cost of setting up six new state governments and five new capitals, and Congress may not want five more states in the mix.

[S7] It is co-chaired by Joe Rodota, former Cabinet Secretary for Governor Pete Wilson; and Steven Maviglio, former Press Secretary to Governor Gray Davis. [S8] The committee suggested that the initiative was damaging the state's image in the world economy. [S9] Rodota stated: \"Every day this measure marches its way toward the ballot it damages the California brand as the nation's economic powerhouse. [S10] It has negative implications that could cost California's businesses and taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.\" In an opinion piece in the *U-T San Diego*, Maviglio and Rodota wrote that if the measure passes, it \"will set in motion the most bureaucratic, costly, paper-pushing process in our history ... [S11] we'd spend years doing nothing more than rewriting laws, duplicating government offices, and spending billions of dollars unnecessarily.\" Furthermore, that it could increase the lobbying industry sixfold in California \"to deal with the flood of open questions\", and would be a burden on California businesses due to the increase of federal regulations regarding interstate commerce. [S12] The segregation of the incomes and tax bases led to criticism that the proposal is merely a money and political power grab for Silicon Valley and California's other wealthy areas. [S13] Phillip Bump of the *Washington Post* wrote that \"this entire plan is really about creating Silicon Valley as its own state. [S14] Therefore Silicon Valley gets to be a state called 'Silicon Valley,' and it gets to make its politics and its money more dense, and everyone in the idyllic dream of Silicon Valley gets to be happy.\"\n\nBrendan Nyhan said that the idea would be unlikely to pass Congress due to disruption it would cause in the political balance of the U.S. [S15] Senate, as well as other sticking points. [S16] Opponents said that the initiative was a thinly disguised Republican power play aimed at diminishing the electoral votes that have historically gone to Democrats in California. [S17] In a survey of the California congressional delegation, *The Hill* found that the Democrats opposed the proposition, while the Republicans were generally divided. [S18] Thus, a couple of political experts countered that the measure would not get the approval of all the parties needed; the voters would not necessarily wish to break up the state with the cost of setting up six new state governments and five new capitals, and Congress may not want five more states in the mix.
