  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC) in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main topic is the CNMC, which is Spain's competition regulator. It was established in 2007 by the Competition Act, replacing the previous Competition Defense Court. The structure includes a president, council members, and directors for investigations. Then there are notable cases: fines on companies for bid rigging in 2021 and 2022, and actions during the energy crisis.\n\nI should focus on the main points: what the CNMC is, when it was created, its role, key structure, and the significant cases. Need to mention the fines and the energy crisis response. Keep it concise, avoiding too many names and dates. Make sure each sentence covers a distinct aspect. Check for key concepts like enforcement of competition law, notable cases, and the impact of their actions. Avoid minor details like specific directors unless necessary. Ensure clarity and flow.\n</think>\n\nThe **Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC)** is Spain's independent competition regulator, established in 2007 under the Competition Act to enforce competition law and ensure fair market practices. It succeeded the Competition Defense Court and oversees investigations, with key leadership including a president and council members. The CNMC has notably penalized companies for bid-rigging, such as fining firms like Siemens and construction giants over 300 million euros for colluding on public contracts, and addressed the 2021–2022 energy crisis by easing collateral requirements for smaller electricity traders. Its actions aim to promote fair competition, protect consumers, and mitigate anti-competitive practices in critical sectors.",

The answer cites [S6], which explicitly states that the collusion involved 'submitting bids for public projects, such as roads and airports.'
