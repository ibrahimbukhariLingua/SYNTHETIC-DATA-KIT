  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the document carefully.\n\nThe ECI is a measure of the productive capabilities of economic systems, looking at the knowledge accumulated in a population through economic activities. It's developed by Hidalgo and Hausmann, using trade data and other sources. The index considers both the diversity of exports and their sophistication. Higher ECI is linked to economic development and lower income inequality. The document also provides a 2021 country ranking, showing top countries like Japan and lower ones like Angola.\n\nI should make sure to mention the main purpose of ECI, who developed it, how it's calculated (using trade data, diversity, and ubiquity), its utility in predicting growth and inequality, and the example rankings. Need to keep it concise, avoiding too many details from the table. Also, note that it's used beyond trade data now, like patents and publications. Check if the key concepts are covered: knowledge, diversity, sophistication, economic development, and the predictive power. Avoid mentioning specific countries unless necessary, but the rankings are part of the document, so maybe a brief mention of the top and bottom countries. Make sure the summary flows well and each sentence adds value without redundancy.\n</think>\n\nThe **Economic Complexity Index (ECI)** measures the productive capabilities of economies by assessing the knowledge embedded in their economic activities, reflecting both the diversity and sophistication of exports. Developed by Cesar Hidalgo and Ricardo Hausmann, the ECI uses trade data and other indicators like patents to evaluate how accumulated knowledge drives economic development, with higher ECI correlating to faster growth and reduced income inequality. Countries like Japan and Germany rank high due to their diversified, complex economies, while lower-ranked nations such as Angola and Congo face limited diversification and simpler export structures. The index serves as a predictive tool for economic prospects and highlights the importance of accumulating productive capabilities for long-term development.",

[S2] In particular, the ECI looks to explain the knowledge accumulated in a population and that is expressed in the economic activities present in a city, country, or region. [S3] To achieve this goal, the ECI defines the knowledge available in a location, as the average knowledge of the activities present in it, and the knowledge of an activity as the average knowledge of the places where that economic activity is conducted. [S4] The product equivalent of the economic complexity index is the product complexity index or PCI. [S5] Higher economic complexity as compared to country's income level drives economic development. [S6] ## Background\n\nThe ECI was developed by Cesar A. [S7] Hidalgo, from the MIT Media Lab and Ricardo Hausmann, from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. [S8] ECI data is available in The Observatory of Economic Complexity. [S9] The original formulation of the economic complexity index was published in PNAS in 2009. [S10] ## Formulation\n\nIn its strict mathematical definition, the ECI is defined in terms of an eigenvalue of a matrix connecting countries to countries, which is a projection of the matrix connecting countries to the products they export. [S11] Since the ECI considers information on the diversity of countries and the ubiquity of products, it is able to produce a measure of economic complexity containing information about both the diversity of a country's exports and their sophistication. [S12] For example, Japan or Germany, with high ECIs, export many goods that are less common and that are produced by highly diversified countries, indicating that these are diverse and sophisticated economies. [S13] Countries with low ECI, like Angola or Botswana, export only a few products, which are of relatively high ubiquity and which are exported by countries that are not necessarily very diversified, indicating that these are countries that have little diversity and that the products that they export are not very sophisticated. [S14] ## Utility\n\nHidalgo and Hausmann propose the concept of ECI not only as a descriptive measure, but also as a predictive tool for economic growth and income inequality. [S15] According to the statistics models presented in their Atlas of Economic Complexity (2011), the ECI is a more accurate predictor of GDP per capita growth than traditional measures of governance, competitiveness (World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index) and human capital (as measured in terms of educational attainment). [S16] ECI also shows a strong negative correlation with income inequality, suggesting that more knowledge intense productive structures are more inclusive in terms of income distribution, and providing a statistically more powerful explanation of cross-national variations in income inequality than Kuznets Curve. [S17] Economic development requires the accumulation of productive knowledge and its use in both more and more complex industries. [S18] According to this metric, many low-income countries, including Bangladesh, Venezuela, and Angola have failed to diversify their knowhow and face low growth prospects while those like India, Turkey, and the Philippines have added productive capabilities to enter new sectors and are expected by some drive growth over the coming years.

[S12] For example, Japan or Germany, with high ECIs, export many goods that are less common and that are produced by highly diversified countries, indicating that these are diverse and sophisticated economies. [S13] Countries with low ECI, like Angola or Botswana, export only a few products, which are of relatively high ubiquity and which are exported by countries that are not necessarily very diversified, indicating that these are countries that have little diversity and that the products that they export are not very sophisticated. [S14] ## Utility\n\nHidalgo and Hausmann propose the concept of ECI not only as a descriptive measure, but also as a predictive tool for economic growth and income inequality. [S15] According to the statistics models presented in their Atlas of Economic Complexity (2011), the ECI is a more accurate predictor of GDP per capita growth than traditional measures of governance, competitiveness (World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index) and human capital (as measured in terms of educational attainment).
