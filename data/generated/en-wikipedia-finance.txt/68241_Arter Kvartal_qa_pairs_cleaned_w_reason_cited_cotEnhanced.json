  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Arter Kvartal in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.\n\nThe main points are that Arter Kvartal is a high-rise building complex in Tallinn, Estonia, under construction. It has three buildings: a 28-story main tower, a 15-story Tower B, and a 9-story Tower C. The main tower is the third-tallest in Estonia, 111 meters tall. The complex is set for completion in autumn 2024. The main building will be Swedbank's headquarters, Tower B has offices, a sports club, and spa, while Tower C is an apartment hotel. They're connected by a glass-roofed atrium. The developer is Kapitel, and the project costs over 150 million euros.\n\nI need to condense this. Start with the main topic: Arter Kvartal is a high-rise complex in Tallinn. Mention the three buildings, their heights, and key functions. Note the completion date, developer, cost, and the connection via the atrium. Make sure to highlight the main building's significance as the third-tallest in Estonia and the main tenant, Swedbank. Also, include the other buildings' purposes. Keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Avoid minor details like the exact cost if possible, but the user said to focus on main topics and key concepts. Maybe include the cost as a key concept. Check for any other important info. The user might want the key concepts like the developer, completion date, building details, and the atrium connection. Alright, let me structure that.\n</think>\n\nArter Kvartal is a high-rise building complex under construction in Tallinn, Estonia, comprising three structures: a 28-story, 111-meter main tower (third-tallest in Estonia), a 15-story Tower B with office spaces and recreational facilities, and a 9-story Tower C serving as an apartment hotel. The project, developed by Kapitel, will feature a glass-roofed atrium connecting the buildings and is set for completion in autumn 2024. The main tower will house Swedbank's headquarters, while Tower B includes a sports club and spa, reflecting the complex's mixed-use design. The development, costing over 150 million euros, emphasizes modern urban living and commercial integration.",
