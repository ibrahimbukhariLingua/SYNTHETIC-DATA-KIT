  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the India Business Report. Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe main points are that it's a weekly business news program by the BBC on BBC World News, presented by Yogita Limaye. The last episode was in April 2016. There's a table with presenters, including Yogita as the main one and others like Shilpa Kannan and Sameer Hashmi. Then there's a section on former presenters like Karishma Vaswani. The schedule shows times for Sunday at 05:30 GMT and 16:30 except for Europe, with corresponding Mumbai times. \n\nI need to focus on the main topic and key concepts. The main topic is the India Business Report as a BBC program. Key concepts include the presenter, the schedule, and the fact that it ended in 2016. Also, the structure of the document with presenters and schedule details. I should mention the production by BBC, the presenter, the end date, and the schedule details. Avoid minor details like the exact days unless necessary. Make sure it's 3-5 sentences. Let me check if I missed anything. The former presenters might not be as crucial unless the summary needs to note the team. But the user said focus on main topic and key concepts. So maybe just the main presenter and the schedule. Also, the program's end date is important. Alright, putting it all together concisely.\n</think>\n\nThe **India Business Report** was a weekly business news program produced by the BBC and aired on BBC World News, hosted by Yogita Limaye, with Shilpa Kannan and Sameer Hashmi as presenters. The show, which concluded its run on 3 April 2016, provided business insights and updates, targeting audiences in London and Mumbai with scheduled broadcasts on Sundays. It featured a team of presenters, including former contributors like Karishma Vaswani and Rajini Vaidyanathan, and operated on a specific timetable adjusted for time zones. The program highlighted India's economic landscape through journalistic coverage, though it is no longer active.",
