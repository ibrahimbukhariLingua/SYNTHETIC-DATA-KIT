  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Yahoo! Inc. from 1995 to 2017 in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content to identify the main points.\n\nThe document starts by introducing Yahoo as a tech company founded in 1994 by Jerry Yang and David Filo. It mentions their early success as a web portal and search engine, with key services like Yahoo Mail, News, and Finance. The company's peak in the 90s and early 2000s is highlighted, followed by a decline in the late 2000s. Marissa Mayer became CEO in 2012, but despite some moves like acquiring Tumblr, Yahoo struggled with competition, security breaches, and a loss of market share. The company was eventually acquired by Verizon in 2017 for $4.48 billion, leading to its rebranding as Altaba Inc. and later part of Verizon Media.\n\nI should note the key events: founding, rise as a major internet player, decline, key leadership changes, acquisitions, security issues, and the Verizon acquisition. Also, mention the main services and the impact of the data breaches. Need to keep it concise, focusing on the main topic and key concepts without too many details. Make sure to include the timeline and the outcome of the acquisition. Avoid specific numbers unless they're crucial, like the acquisition price. Check for any other important points like the name changes and the role of Marissa Mayer. Okay, that should cover the main aspects.\n</think>\n\nYahoo! Inc. (1995–2017) was a pioneering American tech company founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in 1994, known for its web portal, search engine, and services like Yahoo Mail, News, and Finance. It dominated the early internet era but declined in the late 2000s due to competition, poor leadership transitions, and failed innovations, culminating in a $4.48 billion acquisition by Verizon in 2017. The company faced significant challenges, including massive data breaches, failed acquisitions (e.g., Tumblr), and a loss of market relevance, leading to its rebranding as Altaba Inc. and eventual integration into Verizon Media. Its legacy includes shaping early internet infrastructure and navigating the shift from a centralized portal to a fragmented digital landscape.",

[S6] Inc.** was an American multinational technology company headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. [S7] Yahoo was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was incorporated on March 2, 1995. [S8] Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early internet era in the 1990s. [S9] Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, was CEO and president of Yahoo from July 2012 until June 2017. [S10] It was globally known for its Web portal, search engine Yahoo! [S11] Search, and related services, including Yahoo! [S12] Directory, Yahoo! [S13] Mail, Yahoo! [S14] News, Yahoo! [S15] Finance, Yahoo! [S16] Groups, Yahoo! [S17] Answers, advertising, online mapping, video sharing, fantasy sports, and its social media website. [S18] At its height, it was one of the most popular sites in the United States. [S19] According to third-party web analytics providers, Alexa and SimilarWeb, Yahoo! [S20] was the highest-read news and media website, with over seven billion views per month, being the sixth most visited website globally in 2016 According to news sources, roughly 700 million people visited Yahoo websites every month. [S21] Yahoo itself claimed it attracted \"more than half a billion consumers every month in more than 30 languages\". [S22] Once the most popular website in the U.S., Yahoo slowly started to decline since the late 2000s, and on February 21, 2017, Verizon Communications announced its intent to acquire old Yahoo's internet business (excluding its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo! [S23] Japan) for $4.48 billion—the company was once valued at over $100 billion. [S24] Before the transaction was completed, the company expected to change its name to **Altaba Inc.** Verizon completed its acquisition of the old iteration of Yahoo! [S25] Inc's internet business on June 13, 2017. [S26] Verizon announced that the old Yahoo! [S27] Inc's internet assets would be combined under a new subsidiary, Oath, which later became known as Verizon Media in 2019 and eventually renamed to the current iteration of Yahoo! [S28] Inc. [S29] in 2021. [S30] ## History\n\n\n### Founding\n\nIn January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University, when they created a website named \"Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web\". [S31] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. [S32] In March 1994, \"Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web\" was renamed \"Yahoo!\", the human-edited Yahoo! [S33] Directory, provided for users to surf through the internet, being their first product and original purpose. [S34] The \"yahoo.com\" domain was created on January 18, 1995. [S35] The word \"yahoo\" is a backronym for \"Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle\" or \"Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle\". [S36] The term \"hierarchical\" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. [S37] The term \"oracle\" was intended to mean \"source of truth and wisdom\", and the term \"officious\", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work. [S38] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a \"yahoo\" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): \"rude, unsophisticated, uncouth.\" This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from *Gulliver's Travels*. [S39] ### Expansion\n\nYahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. [S40] Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal. [S41] By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the most popular search engine. [S42] It also made many high-profile acquisitions.",

[S4] The following services were in a column under \"Sunset\": Yahoo Picks, AltaVista, MyM, AlltheWeb, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Buzz, del.icio.us, and MyBlogLog. [S5] Under the \"Merge\" column were: Upcoming, FoxyTunes, Yahoo Events, Yahoo People Search, Sideline, and FireEagle. [S6] 11 other properties were listed that Yahoo was interested in developing into feature sites within the portal to take the place of the \"Sunset\" and \"Merge\" vacancies, including the prior feature services (before the new Yahoo Mail was launched), were Yahoo Address Book, Calendar, and Notepad. [S7] Despite Notepad being listed as a feature service instead of sunset or merge in 2010, Yahoo has since taken steps to de-emphasize Notepad. [S8] For example, in January 2013, Notepad was no longer linked within the new Yahoo mail service, although it continued to be linked in the older Classic version. [S9] Also, starting in mid- to late January 2013, Notepad was no longer searchable.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ\n\nThe blog on the *del.icio.us* website released a post by Chris Yeh after the slide was leaked in which Yeh stated that \"Sunset\" doesn't necessarily mean that Yahoo is closing down the site. [S10] Yeh further explained that other possibilities—including del.icio.us leaving Yahoo (through sale or spinoff)—were still being considered: \"We can only imagine how upsetting the news coverage over the past 24 hours has been to many of you.

[S22] Yahoo retains search requests for a period of 13 months. [S23] However, in response to European regulators, Yahoo obfuscates the IP address of users after three months by deleting its last eight bits. [S24] On March 29, 2012, Yahoo announced that it would introduce a \"Do Not Track\" feature that summer, allowing users to opt out of Web-visit tracking and customized advertisements.

[S14] ## Logos and themes\n\nThe first logo appeared when the company was founded in 1994—it was red with three icons on each side. [S15] The logo used on the Yahoo home page formerly consisted of the color red with a black outline and shadow; however, in May 2009, together with a theme redesign, the logo was changed to purple without an outline or shadow. [S16] This change also applied to several international Yahoo home pages. [S17] In some countries, most notably Yahoo!7 (of Australia), the logo remained red until 2014. [S18] On occasion the logo is abbreviated: \"Y!\"\n\nOn August 7, 2013, at around midnight EDT, Yahoo announced that the final version of the new logo would be revealed on September 5, 2013, at 4:00 a.m. [S19] UTC.

[S21] The new logo was eventually launched with an accompanying video that showed its digital construction, and Mayer published a personalized description of the design process on her Tumblr page. [S22] Mayer explains:\n\n> So, one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our logo design team ... [S23] We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail. [S24] We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo – whimsical, yet sophisticated. [S25] Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history. [S26] Having a human touch, personal. [S27] Proud. [S28] On September 19, 2013, Yahoo launched a new version of the \"My Yahoo\" personalized homepage. [S29] The redesign allows users to tailor a homepage with widgets that access features such as email accounts, calendars, Flickr and other Yahoo content, and Internet content. [S30] Users can also select \"theme packs\" that represent artists such as Polly Apfelbaum and Alec Monopoly, and bands such as Empire of the Sun.

The message on its domain is directly quoted from [S7], which states 'Starting from December 31, 2012, Yahoo! Korea has ended.'

[S4] Yahoo officially entered the MENA region when it acquired Maktoob, a pan-regional, Arabic-language hosting and social services online portal, on August 25, 2009.
