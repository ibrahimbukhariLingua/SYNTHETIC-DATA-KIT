  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document on risk-seeking in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document begins by defining a risk-seeker as someone who prefers risk, contrasting them with risk-averse individuals. It uses an example of choosing between a sure $50 and a 50% chance of $100 or nothing. Then it explains the utility function, noting that risk-seekers have a convex utility curve, while risk-averse have concave. The expected utility theory is mentioned, along with prospect theory's value functions, which are convex in the negative domain and concave in the positive.\n\nNext, the psychology section discusses factors contributing to risk-seeking. There's a study linking low childhood conscientiousness to higher risk-seeking and mortality. Zuckerman's sensation-seeking theory connects risk behaviors like gambling and drug use. Impulsivity is tied to risk-seeking, and the neuropsychological perspective focuses on cognitive processes rather than just impulsivity. Lastly, it mentions gender differences, with men generally seeking more risks due to higher testosterone levels.\n\nSo the main points are: definition of risk-seekers, utility functions and expected utility theory, psychological factors like personality traits and gender differences. I need to condense this into a concise summary, making sure to cover the key concepts from both the economic and psychological aspects. Avoid too much detail on the examples but highlight the main theories and findings.\n</think>\n\nThe document defines a **risk-seeker** as an individual who prefers uncertain outcomes over guaranteed ones, illustrated by choosing a 50% chance of $100 or nothing over a sure $50, despite equal expected values. It explains that risk-seeking behavior is modeled through **convex utility functions** in expected utility theory, contrasting with risk-averse (concave) and risk-neutral (linear) preferences, and notes that prospect theory shows convexity in the negative domain. Psychologically, risk-seeking is linked to traits like low childhood conscientiousness, impulsivity, and sensation-seeking, with gender differences influenced by biological factors like testosterone levels. The text integrates economic theory, behavioral psychology, and neuropsychological perspectives to explain how personality, cognition, and biology shape risk preferences.",

[S2] While most investors are considered risk averse, one could view casino-goers as risk-seeking. [S3] A common example to explain risk-seeking behaviour is; If offered two choices; either $50 as a sure thing, or a 50% chance each of either $100 or nothing, a risk-seeking person would prefer the gamble. [S4] Even though the gamble and the \"sure thing\" have the same expected value, the preference for risk makes the gamble's expected utility for the individual much higher. [S5] ## The Utility Function and Risk-Seekers\n\nChoice under uncertainty is when a person facing a choice is not certain of the possible outcomes or their probability of occurring. [S6] The standard way to model how people choose under uncertain condition, is by using expected utility. [S7] In order to calculate expected utility, a utility function 'u' is developed in order to translate money into Utility. [S8] Therefore, if a person has '{\\displaystyle x}' money, their utility would be {\\displaystyle u(x)}. [S9] This is explored further when investigating potential \"prospects\". [S10] A prospect, in this context, is a list of expected payoffs and their probabilities of occurring. [S11] A prospect is summarised using the form;\n\n{\\displaystyle ProspectA=(p\\_{1},x\\_{1};p\\_{2},x\\_{2};...;p\\_{n},x\\_{n})}\n\nThe overall expected value of the prospect (A) is subsequently expressed as;\n\n{\\displaystyle V(A)=\\sum \\_{n=1}^{n}p\\_{i}x\\_{i}}\n\nThe expected utility, U(A), of the prospect is then determined using the below formula;\n\n{\\displaystyle U(A)=\\sum \\_{n=1}^{n}p\\_{i}u(x\\_{i})}\n\nThe utility function is convex for a risk-lover and concave for a risk-averse person (and subsequently linear for a risk-neutral person). [S12] Subsequently, it can be understood that the utility function curves in this way depending on the individual's personal preference towards risk. [S13] Below is an example of a convex utility function, with wealth, '{\\displaystyle x}' along the x-axis and utility, '{\\displaystyle u(x)}' along the y-axis. [S14] The below graph shows how greater payoffs result in larger utility values at an increasing rate. [S15] Showing that the person with this utility function is \"risk-loving\". [S16] Alternatively, below is an example of a concave utility function, with wealth, '{\\displaystyle x}' along the x-axis and utility, '{\\displaystyle u(x)}' along the y-axis. [S17] The below graph again display's an individual's utility function, however this time lower payoffs have a larger utility with respect to the original payoff (or \"wealth\") value. [S18] The utility values, although still increasing, do so as a decreasing rate. [S19] Showing that this person is \"risk-averse\". [S20] It is important to note that for prospect theory value functions, risk-seeking behaviour can be observed in the negative domain {\\displaystyle x<0}, where the functions are convex for {\\displaystyle x<0} but concave for {\\displaystyle x>0}.

[S23] (1995), they found significant evidence to support that low childhood conscientiousness contributed heavily to adulthood mortality. [S24] Those who were high in conscientiousness as a child were 30% less likely to die in their adulthood. [S25] Ultimately, their findings solidified that low levels of childhood conscientiousness predict risk seeking, and risk-seeking increases the chance of accidental death. [S26] Though risk-seeking deteriorates with age, risky exposure to abusive substances in adolescence can lead to lifetime risk factors due to addiction. [S27] Conscientious individuals are subject to greater internal impulse control which lets them think out risky decisions more carefully, while those low on conscientiousness are more likely to endanger themselves and others by risky, or sometimes even criminal behaviour.

[S2] While most investors are considered risk averse, one could view casino-goers as risk-seeking. [S3] A common example to explain risk-seeking behaviour is; If offered two choices; either $50 as a sure thing, or a 50% chance each of either $100 or nothing, a risk-seeking person would prefer the gamble. [S4] Even though the gamble and the \"sure thing\" have the same expected value, the preference for risk makes the gamble's expected utility for the individual much higher. [S5] ## The Utility Function and Risk-Seekers\n\nChoice under uncertainty is when a person facing a choice is not certain of the possible outcomes or their probability of occurring. [S6] The standard way to model how people choose under uncertain condition, is by using expected utility. [S7] In order to calculate expected utility, a utility function 'u' is developed in order to translate money into Utility. [S8] Therefore, if a person has '{\\displaystyle x}' money, their utility would be {\\displaystyle u(x)}. [S9] This is explored further when investigating potential \"prospects\". [S10] A prospect, in this context, is a list of expected payoffs and their probabilities of occurring.

[S12] Subsequently, it can be understood that the utility function curves in this way depending on the individual's personal preference towards risk. [S13] Below is an example of a convex utility function, with wealth, '{\\displaystyle x}' along the x-axis and utility, '{\\displaystyle u(x)}' along the y-axis.
