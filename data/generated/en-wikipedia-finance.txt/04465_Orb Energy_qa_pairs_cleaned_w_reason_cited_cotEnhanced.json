  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Orb Energy in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.\n\nThe main points are that Orb Energy is a solar energy company based in Bangalore, founded in 2006 by Damian Miller and NP Ramesh. They started with a branch in Kumta and expanded to 100 branches in Karnataka by 2015. Then they expanded to Africa in 2014, setting up a subsidiary in Kenya to replicate their Indian business model.\n\nSo the key elements are the company's origin, founders, location, expansion in India, and then international expansion into Africa. I should make sure to mention the years and the key milestones. Also, the fact that they have a subsidiary in Kenya is important. I need to keep it concise, so maybe combine the expansion details into a couple of sentences. Avoid any extra details not mentioned. Check for clarity and that all main topics are covered.\n</think>\n\nOrb Energy is a solar energy company based in Bangalore, India, founded in 2006 by Damian Miller and NP Ramesh. It expanded rapidly in India, reaching 100 branches in Karnataka by 2015, starting with its first branch in Kumta. The company later extended its operations to Africa in 2014, establishing a subsidiary in Kenya to replicate its successful Indian business model. Its focus on solar energy and regional expansion highlights its growth strategy and commitment to renewable energy solutions.",
