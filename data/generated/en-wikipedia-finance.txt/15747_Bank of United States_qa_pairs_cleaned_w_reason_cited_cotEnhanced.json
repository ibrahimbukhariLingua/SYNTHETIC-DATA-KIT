  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Bank of United States in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main points seem to be the founding of the bank by Joseph S. Marcus in 1913, its growth under his son Bernard, the failure in 1930 leading to a bank run, and the impact on the Great Depression. The key concepts include the bank's formation, the role of the founder and his son, the mergers that expanded the bank, the specific event of the Bronx branch run, and the subsequent effects on the banking system.\n\nI should mention the founder, the growth through mergers, the failure triggered by the bank run, and the broader economic impact. Also, note the factors like the false rumor, the inability to get a loan, and the aftermath with other bank failures. Need to keep it concise, making sure each sentence covers a main topic without too much detail. Check for any specific numbers or names that are crucial, like the date of failure, the number of branches, and the role in the Great Depression. Avoid minor details like the exact dates of mergers unless they're critical. Make sure the summary flows logically from formation to failure to aftermath.\n</think>\n\nThe **Bank of United States**, founded in 1913 by Joseph S. Marcus, grew rapidly through mergers under his son Bernard, becoming one of New York's largest banks by 1930. Its collapse in 1930, triggered by a panic-driven bank run at its Bronx branch following a false rumor, marked a pivotal moment in the Great Depression, exacerbating widespread banking crises. The bank's failure highlighted systemic vulnerabilities, including speculative practices, legal challenges, and resistance from Wall Street banks to rescue it, leading to a loss of $550 million in deposits and sparking further bank failures across the U.S. The event underscored the fragility of the financial system and contributed to the deepening economic downturn.",

[S2] Marcus in 1913 at 77 Delancey Street in New York City, was a New York City bank that failed in 1931. [S3] The bank run on its Bronx branch is said to have started the collapse of banking during the Great Depression. [S4] ## Formation\n\nThe Bank of United States was chartered on June 23, 1913 with a capital of $100,000 and a surplus of $50,000. [S5] The bank was founded by Joseph S. [S6] Marcus, a former president of the Public Bank, also of Delancey Street. [S7] Marcus, who was responsible for the building up of Public Bank, started the new bank, with the backing of several well-known financiers, because of a disagreement with other members of the management. [S8] Though the directors of Public Bank objected to the choice of name, arguing that \"ignorant foreigners would believe that the United States government was interested in this bank and that it was a branch of the United States Treasury in Washington\", the name was approved and the bank came into being. [S9] The use of such an appellation was outlawed in 1926 but did not apply retroactively. [S10] The founder, Joseph S. [S11] Marcus, was a Jewish immigrant to the United States. [S12] Born in Telz, Brandenburg, Germany in 1862, Marcus went to school in Essen and immigrated to the United States at the age of 17. [S13] He worked his way up from being a tailor to a garment industry business to being a banker. [S14] He founded the Public Bank in 1906 and the Bank of United States in 1913. [S15] He died on July 3, 1927. [S16] He was also a philanthropist known for his donations to the Beth Israel Hospital and for the Hebrew Association for the Blind. [S17] His son, Bernard K. [S18] Marcus, a graduate of Worcester Academy and Columbia University, joined the bank as cashier in 1913 and became vice president in 1918. [S19] ## Growth\n\nThe bank grew slowly, with only five branches by 1925. [S20] However, after the death of the founder, his son Bernard, who had been running the bank since 1919, grew the bank rapidly through a series of mergers until it had 62 branches by 1930. [S21] In April 1928, it merged with the Central Mercantile Bank and Trust Company with Bernard Marcus as the president. [S22] In August 1928, it absorbed the Cosmopolitan Bank. [S23] In April 1929, it absorbed the Colonial Bank and the Bank of the Rockaways. [S24] In May 1929, it merged with the Municipal Bank and Trust Company, making the combined Bank of United States the third largest bank in New York City, and twenty-eighth in the United States. [S25] With a book value of $60 and a dividend payment of $2 for 1929, the president of the bank declared the bank to be on a sound footing in a letter to shareholders following the stock market failure on Black Tuesday. [S26] In mid-1930, four leading New York banks-Manufacturers Trust Company, Public National Bank and Trust Company, International Bank and Trust Company, and the Bank of United States-began talks to merge, and on November 24 announced that they had agreed to form a mega-bank headed by J. [S27] Herbert Case, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. [S28] On December 8, 1930, unable to agree on merger terms, the plan was dropped because, it later emerged, of difficulties in guaranteeing the deposits of Bank of United States, due to complications arising from the legal difficulties of the bank, and because of real estate mortgages and loans held by subsidiaries of the bank. [S29] Two days later, there was a run on a Bronx branch of the bank. [S30] ## Failure\n\nOn December 10, 1930, a large crowd gathered at the Southern Boulevard branch in the Bronx seeking to withdraw their money, and started what is usually considered the bank run that started the Great Depression (though there had already been a wave of bank runs in the southeastern part of the U.S., at least as early as November 1930).
