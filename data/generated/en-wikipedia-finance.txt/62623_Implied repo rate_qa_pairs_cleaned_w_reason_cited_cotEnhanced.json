  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Implied Repo Rate (IRR) in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document explains that the IRR is the return from borrowing money to buy an asset in the spot market and delivering it in the futures market. The formula given is IRR = [(InvoicePrice/PurchasePriceOfBond) - 1] * (dayBase/daysToDelivery), using 365 or 360 days. \n\nThen there's a section on usage, specifically determining the cheapest to deliver (CTD) asset. It says that IRR is calculated for each bond in a basket, and the one with the highest repo rate is the CTD. The reasoning is that a higher IRR means a lower initial value, leading to a higher return when delivered. The document also mentions that the net basis method is less accurate because it doesn't account for the actual running costs of the bonds.\n\nSo the main points are: definition of IRR, its formula, how it's used to find the CTD bond by comparing IRRs, and a comparison with the net basis method. I need to condense this into a concise summary. Make sure to mention the formula, the purpose in determining CTD, and the advantage of IRR over net basis. Avoid too much detail but hit the key concepts.\n</think>\n\nThe **Implied Repo Rate (IRR)** calculates the return from borrowing funds to purchase an asset in the spot market and delivering it in the futures market, using the formula: $ IRR = \\left(\\frac{\\text{InvoicePrice}}{\\text{PurchasePriceOfBond}} - 1\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{dayBase}}{\\text{daysToDelivery}}\\right) $. It is primarily used to identify the **cheapest-to-deliver (CTD)** bond in a futures contract by comparing IRRs across bonds, with the highest IRR indicating the CTD due to its lower initial value and higher return potential. Unlike the net basis method, IRR accounts for actual costs, making it a more accurate measure for CTD ranking. The concept highlights the relationship between spot and futures prices, emphasizing cost efficiency in bond delivery.",
