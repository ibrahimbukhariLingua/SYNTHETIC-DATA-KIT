  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Axa Equitable Center in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content to identify the main points.\n\nThe document provides a detailed overview of the Axa Equitable Center, originally called Equitable Tower. It's a skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, completed in 1986. The building has 54 stories, 752 feet tall, with a distinctive granite facade featuring red and white bands. It's part of a complex with another building, 1285 Sixth Avenue, and includes public spaces, art collections, and a galleria. The building was developed by Equitable Life Assurance Society, later part of Axa, and was sold to CalPERS in 2016. The history includes its construction challenges, artistic elements, and changes in tenants over the years. There's also mention of its architectural style, which was postmodern, and mixed critical reception.\n\nKey concepts: location, architect, design features, art collection, construction history, ownership changes, and impact on the area. I need to condense this into a concise summary focusing on the main topic and key points. Make sure to mention the main details like the building's specs, design, art, and ownership. Also, note the critical reception and its influence on the neighborhood. Avoid minor details like specific tenants unless they're significant. Check for the most important elements and structure them into a few sentences.\n</think>\n\nThe Axa Equitable Center, originally known as Equitable Tower, is a 54-story, 752-foot postmodern skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes and completed in 1986. It features a granite and limestone facade with distinctive red vertical and white horizontal bands, a public galleria, and an extensive art collection spanning works by artists like Sol LeWitt and Roy Lichtenstein, integrating art into its public and corporate spaces. Developed by Equitable Life Assurance Society (later Axa), the building faced mixed architectural criticism but influenced Midtown's office development, later sold to CalPERS in 2016 and housing major tenants like BNP Paribas and Citigroup. Its design and art program aimed to blend corporate identity with urban culture, though its reception highlighted debates over postmodern architecture's efficacy.",

[S2] Completed in 1986 and designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, the building measures 752 feet (229 m) tall with 54 stories. [S3] Equitable Center West was developed by the Equitable Life Assurance Society (later renamed Equitable Holdings, part of Axa) adjacent to Equitable's existing skyscraper at 1285 Avenue of the Americas. [S4] The facade is clad in granite, applied in a two-tone pattern of white horizontal and red vertical bands. [S5] The building has three setbacks, as well as a penthouse at the top with arched windows. [S6] Equitable acquired an extensive collection of artwork to display in the building's public spaces. [S7] There is a public galleria from 51st to 52nd Street, which forms part of 6½ Avenue, as well as an arched entrance atrium from Seventh Avenue. [S8] The complex also includes an underground concourse, several restaurants, and a corporate auditorium. [S9] The building was proposed in the early 1980s and, after the site was acquired, Equitable's board approved the plans for the tower in 1983. [S10] When the tower opened, the company's corporate offices occupied about a third of the space, and the ground story had commercial concerns such as the Le Bernardin restaurant and a branch of the Whitney Museum. [S11] Equitable only used the tower as its headquarters until the late 1990s, and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) acquired Axa Equitable Center in 2016. [S12] ## Site\n\n787 Seventh (formerly known as the AXA Equitable Building) is at 787 Seventh Avenue in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. [S13] The building's rectangular land lot occupies the western half of the city block bounded by Seventh Avenue to the west, 51st Street to the south, Sixth Avenue (Avenue of the Americas) to the east, and 52nd Street to the north. [S14] The site covers 80,333 square feet (7,463.2 m²), with a frontage of 200 feet (61 m) on Seventh Avenue and 400 feet (120 m) along the side streets. [S15] Adjacent is 1285 Avenue of the Americas (1285 Sixth Avenue; Equitable Center East), designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and constructed from 1959 to 1961. [S16] The Sixth Avenue building occupies the eastern half of the city block. [S17] The sidewalk in front of the building is made of pink granite, extending eastward in front of 1285 Sixth Avenue. [S18] The sidewalks adjacent to 1285 Sixth Avenue comprise Urban Plaza North and South, designed by Scott Burton. [S19] Axa Equitable Center is also near 810 Seventh Avenue to the northwest, the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel and Flatotel New York City to the north, Credit Lyonnais Building to the northeast, 1271 Avenue of the Americas to the southeast, The Michelangelo to the south, and the Winter Garden Theatre to the southwest.

[S20] The Indiana limestone and Brazilian granite on the facade is applied in a two-tone pattern. [S21] The vertical pilasters are clad with reddish-brown granite, which is also used for some horizontal bands just below each setback. [S22] The pilasters divide the facades into horizontal spandrel bands of buff-colored limestone, which alternate with glass windows on each floor. [S23] Barnes had used these materials because they harmonized with the colors and materials used on the neighboring buildings. [S24] Axa Equitable Center uses 5,800 panes of glass on its facade. [S25] The main entrance on Seventh Avenue is set within a semicircular-headed arch measuring 72 feet (22 m) tall. [S26] There is a loading dock at the eastern end of the 52nd Street elevation.

[S28] These double-height floors contain recessed windows to give the impression that the red pilasters are massive piers; the recessed windows were inspired by those in Art Deco buildings. [S29] The recessed windows on the double-height floors also wrap around to the west and east elevations. [S30] The topmost penthouse is embellished with large triumphal-arched windows on its west and east elevations, which illuminate the Equitable boardrooms. [S31] The boardroom windows measure 42 feet (13 m) in diameter and 53 feet (16 m) tall.

[S3] ### Galleria and concourse\n\nAt the middle of the city block is the galleria from 51st to 52nd Street. [S4] It is one of six passageways that form 6½ Avenue, a set of full-block passageways from 51st to 57th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. [S5] The passageway was built as a \"through-block connection\" under the Special Midtown District, created in 1982. [S6] The space measures 45 feet (14 m) wide and 91 feet (28 m) tall underneath the north and south ends, where the seventh and eighth floors cross the galleria. [S7] The center of the space, beneath the skylights, is 124 feet (38 m) tall. [S8] Burton designed outdoor seating for the galleria. [S9] On the galleria's eastern wall is a passageway to 1285 Sixth Avenue's lobby, which originally connected with the Paine Webber Art Gallery in that building. [S10] The lobbies of 1285 Sixth Avenue and Equitable Center measured a combined 800 feet (240 m) long. [S11] An elevator lobby for the First National Bank of Chicago, just east of the galleria, contained Agnes Denes's artwork *Hypersphere: The Earth in the Shape of the Universe*, a set of 144 glass panels. [S12] LeWitt commissioned a set of six geometric artworks for the walls of the galleria entitled *Wall Drawing: Bands of Lines in Four Colors and Four Directions, Separated by Gray Bands*. [S13] As the name indicates, LeWitt's artwork consists of vertical, horizontal, and diagonal bands in four colors, created in acrylic paint on limestone. [S14] These works, which are up to 106 feet (32 m) high, are illuminated by natural light coming through the rooftop skylights. [S15] In addition, Flanagan designed two bronze sculptures at the galleria's north and south ends, each depicting animals in whimsical scenes. [S16] The north end contains *Young Elephant* (1986), while the south end contains *Hare on Bell* (1985). [S17] Two escalators lead from the galleria to Axa Center's public basement concourse. [S18] The escalators are placed within a glass enclosure containing a gold-colored frame. [S19] The basement concourse is connected to Rockefeller Center's underground concourse, which in turn provides a connection to the New York City Subway's 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center station. [S20] Axa Center's basement concourse also contains the Athletic & Swim Club, which has a fitness center and a small swimming pool. [S21] Valerie Jaudon had created a mural for the swimming pool's wall, measuring 72 by 12 feet (21.9 by 3.7 m). [S22] ### Interior\n\nAxa Center contains 1,740,000 square feet (162,000 m²) of interior space. [S23] According to the New York City Department of City Planning, the building has a gross floor area of 1,633,544 square feet (151,761.2 m²). [S24] Equitable was allowed to include an additional 49,161 square feet (4,567.2 m²) in exchange for providing privately owned public space. [S25] The steel superstructure contains two-story outrigger trusses wrapping around the 11th and 36th stories, which transfer the structural loads and absorb the wind loads at each of the setbacks. [S26] Belt trusses connect the outrigger trusses to the building's structural core. [S27] The roof is surrounded by a hat truss, behind which is mechanical equipment. [S28] From the beginning, 787 Seventh Avenue contained several \"smart\" building systems, such as high-capacity fiber optic cables and conduits, as well as a computerized display to monitor energy use, security, and elevators. [S29] The \"smart\" systems cost $2 to $4 million, though that cost also included a retrofit of 1285 Sixth Avenue. [S30] The building is internally connected to 1285 Sixth Avenue at the ground floor, concourse, and first eight stories. [S31] The 787 Seventh Avenue building was known as Equitable Center West or Equitable Tower, while the 1285 Sixth Avenue building was known as Equitable Center East.

[S23] During construction that July, a construction hoist fell from Equitable Tower and killed two workers. [S24] ### Opening and early years\n\nBy early 1986, Equitable had finished the atrium, galleria, plazas, and lobby, as well as a branch of the Whitney Museum. [S25] The company had taken the top third of the building and expected to rent out the remaining stories at a rate of $40 to $50 per square foot ($430 to $540/m²), a higher rate than at nearby office buildings.

[S4] Within a year of Equitable Tower's opening, eighty percent of the space had been leased. [S5] Among the tenants were arts organizations American Council for the Arts, Center for Arts Information, and Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts, which were offered below-market-rate rents. [S6] In addition, accounting firm Ernst & Whinney (later Ernst & Young) took space in the tower. [S7] By October 1987, when Black Monday occurred, Equitable Tower was fully leased despite charging higher rents per square foot than other buildings in the area. [S8] The American grill Sam's Restaurant opened at ground level at the end of that year. [S9] ### 1990s and 2000s\n\nBy 1990, Equitable was in the process of being acquired by the French company Axa. [S10] Within two years, Equitable had gone public and downsized most of its employees, leaving only 2,200 working at 787 Seventh Avenue. [S11] The company was considering leaving for the suburbs, given the high costs of occupying office space in midtown, but ultimately decided against it. [S12] The Whitney branch in Equitable Tower closed in 1992, when its original agreement expired, and it was replaced by an art gallery called the Equitable Gallery. [S13] Sam's Restaurant closed the next year, being replaced by another American grill, Judson Grill, in early 1994. [S14] Equitable only occupied ten percent of 787 Seventh Avenue by early 1995, when it placed 300,000 square feet (28,000 m²) of space for lease. [S15] That year, Equitable announced it would be moving one block east to 1290 Sixth Avenue, with only the highest-ranking executives remaining at 787 Seventh Avenue. [S16] Much of Equitable's space at 787 Seventh Avenue was taken by law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, and the floor just below the penthouse was occupied by Paramount Capital. [S17] With Equitable's relocation, the *America Today* murals were moved to 1290 Sixth Avenue.

[S10] At the time of its completion, the building was the only major office structure on Seventh Avenue. [S11] This led *Architectural Record* to say: \"Equitable Life Assurance Society has heeded Horace Greeley's dictum, 'Go West', though not, to be sure, very far west.\" According to Reynolds, the building's construction encouraged office development to move west from Sixth to Seventh Avenue, just as the construction of Rockefeller Center had encouraged a similar westward movement from Fifth to Sixth Avenue. [S12] *Architectural Record* described the building as having been proposed \"amidst a swirl of controversy over what some see as an over-concentration of new skyscraper construction in Manhattan's crowded midtown\". [S13] Nonetheless, the development of Equitable Tower directly improved the character of the surrounding area, particularly the Midtown portion of Seventh Avenue, in the mid-1980s. [S14] Following the tower's construction, William Zeckendorf developed the nearby One Worldwide Plaza to improve the character of Eighth Avenue.

      "reasoning": "The answer cites [S11], which explicitly states that the construction of Equitable Tower encouraged office development to move west from Sixth to Seventh Avenue. This is supported by the passage's mention of Reynolds' assertion that the building's construction led to this westward shift, mirroring the impact of Rockefeller Center on Fifth to Sixth Avenue. The reasoning connects the cited sentence directly to the answer by highlighting the specific influence described in [S11].",
