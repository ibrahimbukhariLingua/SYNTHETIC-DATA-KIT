  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Indian Super League club owners. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document lists current and former club owners. The current clubs section has a table with club names, owners, their net worth, and sources of wealth. For example, Bengaluru is owned by JSW Group with a net worth of $2.7B from steel and energy. Chennaiyin has Abhishek Bachchan and MS Dhoni as owners. There's also info on former clubs like Pune City and ATK, which have been dissolved.\n\nThe main topic here is the ownership structure of ISL clubs. Key concepts include the various owners, their net worth, and how they've acquired their wealth. The summary should mention both current and former clubs, highlighting the notable owners and their sources of wealth. I need to keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Let me check if I missed any important details. The former clubs section is also important to mention, even though they're no longer active. I should note that some clubs have dissolved. Also, the current clubs have a mix of individuals, groups, and companies. Maybe mention the range of net worths and the different industries they come from, like steel, entertainment, investments, etc. Avoid getting too detailed with each club but capture the overall picture. Make sure to include the key points: current owners, their net worth, sources, and the status of former clubs. Alright, time to put it all together.\n</think>\n\nThe document provides a list of current and former owners of Indian Super League (ISL) football clubs, highlighting their net worth, sources of wealth, and ownership structures. Current clubs are owned by a mix of prominent individuals (e.g., Abhishek Bachchan, Virat Kohli), groups (e.g., JSW Group, Tata Steel), and companies, with net worths ranging from $131 million to $3 billion, often tied to industries like steel, entertainment, and investments. Former clubs like Pune City and ATK have dissolved, with their owners including celebrities and business groups. The summary underscores the diverse ownership landscape and financial backing of ISL teams.",
