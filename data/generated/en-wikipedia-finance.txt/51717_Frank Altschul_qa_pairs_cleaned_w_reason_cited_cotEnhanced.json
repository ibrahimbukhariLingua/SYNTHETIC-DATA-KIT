[S2] ## Early life\n\nAltschul was born to a Jewish family in San Francisco, the son of Camilla (née Mandlebaum) and Charles Altschul. [S3] His father had immigrated to the United States from London in 1877 and was the eighth employee of the San Francisco bank Lazard Freres. [S4] In 1901, the Altschul family moved to New York City. [S5] In 1908, Altschul graduated from Yale University. [S6] ## Career\n\nHe joined Lazard Freres in 1908 and served in France as an Army captain during World War I. [S7] In 1916, his father retired as partner at Lazard and Altschul took his place in the firm as one of five partners. [S8] In the 1920s, he was awarded the Legion of Honor by the government of France after giving successful advice on how to stabilize the French franc.

[S12] Later he moved on again to General American Investors Company, and maintained his position as an executive until his retirement in 1961. [S13] He founded the private family office, Overbrook Management Corporation, to manage and protect the wealth and financial well-being of the Altschul Family. [S14] In 2002, the office opened its doors to provide asset management and related services to institutional investors and high net worth individuals. [S15] Over the years, Overbrook's leadership passed to his son, Arthur Altschul, and then to his grandson, Arthur Goodhart Altschul Jr, who currently serves as Overbrook's Chairman.

[S2] ## Early life\n\nAltschul was born to a Jewish family in San Francisco, the son of Camilla (née Mandlebaum) and Charles Altschul. [S3] His father had immigrated to the United States from London in 1877 and was the eighth employee of the San Francisco bank Lazard Freres. [S4] In 1901, the Altschul family moved to New York City. [S5] In 1908, Altschul graduated from Yale University. [S6] ## Career\n\nHe joined Lazard Freres in 1908 and served in France as an Army captain during World War I. [S7] In 1916, his father retired as partner at Lazard and Altschul took his place in the firm as one of five partners. [S8] In the 1920s, he was awarded the Legion of Honor by the government of France after giving successful advice on how to stabilize the French franc. [S9] In the 1930s, he was part of the committee that governs the New York Stock Exchange before moving on to work with the Chase National Bank. [S10] In 1934, he established Overbrook Press which specialized in illustrated, limited edition books for collectors. [S11] In 1943, Altschul began working with Lazard Freres as a senior partner. [S12] Later he moved on again to General American Investors Company, and maintained his position as an executive until his retirement in 1961. [S13] He founded the private family office, Overbrook Management Corporation, to manage and protect the wealth and financial well-being of the Altschul Family. [S14] In 2002, the office opened its doors to provide asset management and related services to institutional investors and high net worth individuals. [S15] Over the years, Overbrook's leadership passed to his son, Arthur Altschul, and then to his grandson, Arthur Goodhart Altschul Jr, who currently serves as Overbrook's Chairman. [S16] ## Philanthropy\n\nIn 1924, Altschul co-founded the Yale Library Associates, which was responsible for overseeing Yale libraries. [S17] Between 1961 and 1964, he also made financial contributions to various colleges and universities to establish professorships, including his alma mater Yale University and Williams College. [S18] Altschul served as director of the English-Speaking Union, vice president of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, and as vice president and secretary of the Council on Foreign Relations. [S19] Frank Altschul also maintained a family project, the Overbrook Foundation. [S20] In the summer of 1958, when author William L. [S21] Shirer was \"flat broke\" and desperate for funds that would permit him to finish writing *The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich*, at the recommendation of Hamilton Fish Armstrong the Overbrook Foundation advanced immediately to Shirer $5,000 ($52,500 in 2024 dollars) and promised another $5,000 six months later, enabling Shirer to finish his monumental book. [S22] In the third volume of his autobiography, Shirer writes: \"This saved my life and my book . [S23] . [S24] . [S25] and I settled back to fourteen hours a day of writing.\"\n\n\n## Personal life\n\nHe was married to Helen Lehman Goodhart, granddaughter of Mayer Lehman, niece of Herbert H. [S26] Lehman, former United States Senator and Governor of New York (who his sister Edith married), and sister to Arthur Lehman Goodhart. [S27] They had three children: Margaret Lang (married to journalist Daniel Lang), Edith Graham, and Arthur G. [S28] Altschul. [S29] Altschul was a registered Republican who served twice as a Connecticut delegate to his party's national conventions; although he supported Adlai Stevenson II in his 1952 Presidential race against Dwight D.

[S2] ## Early life\n\nAltschul was born to a Jewish family in San Francisco, the son of Camilla (née Mandlebaum) and Charles Altschul. [S3] His father had immigrated to the United States from London in 1877 and was the eighth employee of the San Francisco bank Lazard Freres. [S4] In 1901, the Altschul family moved to New York City. [S5] In 1908, Altschul graduated from Yale University. [S6] ## Career\n\nHe joined Lazard Freres in 1908 and served in France as an Army captain during World War I. [S7] In 1916, his father retired as partner at Lazard and Altschul took his place in the firm as one of five partners. [S8] In the 1920s, he was awarded the Legion of Honor by the government of France after giving successful advice on how to stabilize the French franc. [S9] In the 1930s, he was part of the committee that governs the New York Stock Exchange before moving on to work with the Chase National Bank. [S10] In 1934, he established Overbrook Press which specialized in illustrated, limited edition books for collectors. [S11] In 1943, Altschul began working with Lazard Freres as a senior partner. [S12] Later he moved on again to General American Investors Company, and maintained his position as an executive until his retirement in 1961. [S13] He founded the private family office, Overbrook Management Corporation, to manage and protect the wealth and financial well-being of the Altschul Family. [S14] In 2002, the office opened its doors to provide asset management and related services to institutional investors and high net worth individuals. [S15] Over the years, Overbrook's leadership passed to his son, Arthur Altschul, and then to his grandson, Arthur Goodhart Altschul Jr, who currently serves as Overbrook's Chairman. [S16] ## Philanthropy\n\nIn 1924, Altschul co-founded the Yale Library Associates, which was responsible for overseeing Yale libraries. [S17] Between 1961 and 1964, he also made financial contributions to various colleges and universities to establish professorships, including his alma mater Yale University and Williams College. [S18] Altschul served as director of the English-Speaking Union, vice president of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, and as vice president and secretary of the Council on Foreign Relations. [S19] Frank Altschul also maintained a family project, the Overbrook Foundation. [S20] In the summer of 1958, when author William L. [S21] Shirer was \"flat broke\" and desperate for funds that would permit him to finish writing *The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich*, at the recommendation of Hamilton Fish Armstrong the Overbrook Foundation advanced immediately to Shirer $5,000 ($52,500 in 2024 dollars) and promised another $5,000 six months later, enabling Shirer to finish his monumental book.
