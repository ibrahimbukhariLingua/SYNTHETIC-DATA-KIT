  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Redmond Town Center in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main topic is Redmond Town Center, a mixed-use development in Redmond, Washington. It was built on a former golf course, opened in 1997, and has gone through various changes in ownership and tenants. The history section mentions the original plan for a mall that failed, leading to the current outdoor center. There's a lot of information about different anchors and their closures, like Macy's, REI, Borders, and others. The document also talks about recent redevelopment plans to make it more walkable with mixed-use buildings. \n\nKey points to include: location, ownership changes, history of the site, major anchors over time, recent developments, and the ongoing redevelopment. I should mention the transition from the failed Maingate project to the current Redmond Town Center, the mix of retail, offices, hotels, and the changes in tenants. Also note the 2021 Amazon office and the 2022 redevelopment plans. Need to keep it concise, avoiding too many specific details but highlighting the main transformations and current status.\n</think>\n\nRedmond Town Center is a mixed-use development in downtown Redmond, Washington, originally built on a former golf course and opened in 1997 after a failed mall project, Maingate. It features retail, office spaces (occupied by Microsoft and AT&T), hotels, and entertainment, with major anchors like Macy's (now an Amazon office) and REI (now a Volkswagen office), alongside evolving tenants such as H Mart and Daiso. The site has undergone significant changes, including store closures, redevelopments, and plans to transform into a walkable urban center with more residential and retail spaces. Recent years have seen shifts in ownership, including its 2019 acquisition by Fairbourne Properties, and ongoing adaptations to market trends and community needs.",

      "reasoning": "The passage states in [S2] that 'Redmond Town Center is owned and managed by Fairbourne Properties.' This directly answers the question by explicitly identifying Fairbourne Properties as the owner and manager. While later sentences mention acquisitions of specific portions (e.g., [S4] and [S5]), the question asks for the current owner and manager, and [S2] provides the most direct and unambiguous citation for this information.",

[S2] Owned and managed by Fairbourne Properties, Redmond Town Center has more than 110 shops, restaurants, lodging, and entertainment venues in an outdoor environment. [S3] It opened in 1997 on the site of a defunct municipal golf course along the north side of State Route 520. [S4] DRA Advisors and JSH acquired the retail component of the Redmond Town Center in 2013, shortly after Shorenstein Properties bought the office portion, which is occupied by Microsoft and AT&T. [S5] In late 2019, the retail portion was sold to Fairbourne Properties. [S6] ## History\n\nThe site was formerly Redmond Golf Links, an 18 hole golf course that opened in 1932. [S7] In 1978, Winmar, a real estate company owned by Safeco Insurance., eventually closed the 120-acre property and planned to develop the site into a mixed-use shopping mall. [S8] The project, named Maingate, was planned to include 1,350,000 square feet (125,000 m² ) of retail space, along with office spaces, 160 residential units, and 25-30 acres of open space. [S9] This project was controversial, with some Redmond residents and city council candidates expressing concern about the proposed mall's impacts on the walkable nature of the city. [S10] In 1988, the city conditionally approved the project. [S11] Four department stores—Mervyn's, Frederick & Nelson, The Bon Marché, and JCPenney—were signed to be major tenants of Maingate and planning continued for the project, with a construction date announced. [S12] By 1992, Frederick & Nelson went out of business due to bankruptcy and the owner of Bon Marché, Federated Department Stores, briefly went bankrupt. [S13] These two events made the project go on a downward spiral that led to the demise of the project. [S14] However, also in 1992, the City of Redmond accepted another project on the same site by the same developer, Winmar. [S15] Redmond Town Center, which would've included a mixed-use town center that was similar to Maingate, but it was an outdoor center and it only had one department store. [S16] It included a decreased retail space, a walkable town center, hotels, and offices, and residential spaces This project was received more positively by residents and the City Council. [S17] Groundbreaking for the development in 1995, with historical buildings being kept intact while everything else in the site was demolished. [S18] Redmond Town Center eventually opened. [S19] The complex had two floors on the retail section, both directing to stores and dining. [S20] The development included 674,287 square feet (65,000 m² ) of retail space, numerous office buildings, two hotels being owned by Marriott, Marriott Hotels & Resorts and Residence Inn by Marriott, and The Bon Marché, Zany Brainy, REI, Larry's Market, Borders, Todai, and Cineplex Odeon as major anchors. [S21] Office spaces were leased by Microsoft, AT&T Wireless Services, and other tenants. [S22] The development was built in stages, with the town center, offices, and hotels being built before the Bon Marché, as construction was officially finished by 2003. [S23] There were three strip malls connected to the development, Creekside Crossing along Redmond Way, a different center featuring Larry's, Cost Plus World Market, and Big 5 Sporting Goods, and a center including Zany Brainy, Bed Bath & Beyond, and other retail tenants. [S24] After three year of opening, Zany Brainy shuttered from bankruptcy and FAO Schwarz dissolving the company in December 2003. [S25] Months after closing, Petco announced that they were moving into the former space in 2004 from Bear Creek Village, a shopping center nearby, to Redmond Town Center. [S26] It later opened in 2004 in its new space.",

[S9] This project was controversial, with some Redmond residents and city council candidates expressing concern about the proposed mall's impacts on the walkable nature of the city. [S10] In 1988, the city conditionally approved the project. [S11] Four department stores—Mervyn's, Frederick & Nelson, The Bon Marché, and JCPenney—were signed to be major tenants of Maingate and planning continued for the project, with a construction date announced. [S12] By 1992, Frederick & Nelson went out of business due to bankruptcy and the owner of Bon Marché, Federated Department Stores, briefly went bankrupt. [S13] These two events made the project go on a downward spiral that led to the demise of the project.
