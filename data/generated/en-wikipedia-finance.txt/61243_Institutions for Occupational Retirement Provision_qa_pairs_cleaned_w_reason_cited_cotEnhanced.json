  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2016. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main topic is the IORP Directive 2016, which replaces the 2003 version. The purpose is to create an internal market for occupational retirement provision. The key points mentioned are minimum standards for funding, investment types, and cross-border management. \n\nLooking at the 2003 Directive, there are a bunch of articles covering scope, application to social security schemes, exemptions for small schemes, legal separation of assets, registration requirements, reporting obligations, investment rules, and cross-border activities. The revision in 2014 aimed to consolidate other pension directives and add new sections on investment rules, governance, member information rights, and prudential supervision.\n\nI need to condense this into 3-5 sentences. Focus on the main topic: the 2016 Directive replacing the 2003 one, its purpose, key elements like funding, investments, cross-border, and the revision details. Also mention the new titles added in the revision. Avoid listing all the articles but highlight the main concepts. Make sure to mention the transition from 2003 to 2016 and the key changes in the revision.\n</think>\n\nThe **Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive (IORP) 2016/2341** replaces the 2003 version to establish a unified European market for occupational retirement schemes, setting minimum standards for funding, investment rules, and cross-border management. It emphasizes asset protection through legal separation of pension funds, mandatory reporting, and governance requirements, while allowing flexibility in investment strategies and international portfolio management. The 2016 revision expanded on the original framework by introducing stricter quantitative investment guidelines, enhanced member information rights, and standardized prudential supervision across member states, aiming to improve transparency, security, and efficiency in pension provision.",
