  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about NextCard in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document talks about NextCard, Inc., a company that was one of the first to issue credit cards online with instant approval. It was founded in the late 90s by Jeremy and Molly Lent. They had a business plan based on lower customer acquisition costs and better credit risks from internet users. They offered lower interest rates and co-branded cards. But then things went wrong. They had issues with bad debt because their assumptions were wrong—customers weren't as creditworthy as they thought. They tried to hide losses by classifying them as fraud, which led to investigations. The company went under, had a class-action lawsuit, and their auditors were involved in fraud. Eventually, they liquidated with huge debts.\n\nSo the main points are: founding, business model, initial success, flawed assumptions leading to downfall, accounting fraud, legal issues, and liquidation. I need to condense this into a few sentences, making sure to include the key concepts like being a pioneer in online credit cards, the business strategy, the reasons for failure, and the consequences.\n</think>\n\nNextCard, Inc., a pioneering online credit card issuer founded in 1996, aimed to disrupt the industry by leveraging the internet to reduce customer acquisition costs and target affluent, low-risk users, offering lower interest rates and co-branded cards. However, its business model faltered as internet users proved less creditworthy than anticipated, leading to high bad debt losses and aggressive accounting practices, including misclassifying credit losses as fraud. Investigations revealed financial misconduct, including audit tampering by Ernst & Young, and the company collapsed in 2002, liquidating with $470 million in liabilities after a failed takeover and legal battles. Its downfall highlighted the risks of overreliance on flawed assumptions and unethical financial reporting in the dot-com era.",
