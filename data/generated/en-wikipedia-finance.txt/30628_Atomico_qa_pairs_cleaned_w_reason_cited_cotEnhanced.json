  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Atomico in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document says Atomico is a European VC firm based in London with offices in Paris, Berlin, and Stockholm. The founder is Niklas Zennström, who co-founded Skype and Kazaa. That's the main topic: introducing Atomico, its location, and the founder.\n\nNext, the history and investments section mentions they've invested in over 130 companies through four funds. The amounts for the funds are listed: $165 million, $476 million, and $765 million. They also publish an annual report on the European tech industry. That's key info about their investment scale and activities.\n\nThen there are examples of exits or major transactions: Supercell sold to SoftBank for $3B, The Climate Corporation bought by Monsanto for $1.1B, Xobni by Yahoo, PowerReviews by Bazaarvoice, and Rovio's $1B IPO. These are important because they show the success of their investments.\n\nSo the main points are: what Atomico is, their founder, their investment funds and numbers, their annual report, and notable exits. I need to condense this into 3-5 sentences. Let me check if I missed anything. The user wants focus on main topic and key concepts. Avoid minor details. Make sure to mention the funds, the exits, and the annual report. Also, the founder's background is important for context. Alright, time to put it all together concisely.\n</think>\n\nAtomico is a European venture capital firm based in London, with offices in Paris, Berlin, and Stockholm, founded by Niklas Zennström, co-founder of Skype and Kazaa. It has invested in over 130 companies across four funds, raising $765 million in its latest fund, and publishes an annual report on the European tech industry. The firm has facilitated significant exits, including Supercell's $3 billion sale to SoftBank, The Climate Corporation's $1.1 billion acquisition by Monsanto, and Rovio's $1 billion IPO, highlighting its impact on tech innovation and growth.",
