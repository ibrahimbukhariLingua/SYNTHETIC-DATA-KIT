  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Canadian Hydro Developers. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document mentions that Canadian Hydro Developers was a Canadian company with 12 hydroelectric, 8 wind, and 1 biomass site. Founded by John and Ross Keating with Jack McCleary. They started in 1989 with $1.3 million and a contract with TransAlta. They used revenue from their plants to fund future projects. \n\nThen there are acquisitions: they bought CREC in 2005, Vector Wind Energy in 2006, and GW Power Corporation in 2007. In 2009, TransAlta acquired them for $5.25 per share. \n\nThe generating facilities section lists all their sites with details like location, fuel type, capacity, and dates. There are hydro, wind, and one biomass plant. Some wind farms have specific turbine models and capacities. \n\nThe main topic is the company's operations, growth through acquisitions, and their energy facilities. Key concepts include their expansion strategy, types of energy sources, and the acquisition by TransAlta. I need to condense this into 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main points. Make sure to mention the founders, the types of facilities, acquisitions, and the acquisition by TransAlta. Also, note the transition from hydro to including wind and biomass. Avoid too many details on each facility but highlight the key numbers like 12 hydro, 8 wind, 1 biomass. Mention the key acquisitions and the final sale to TransAlta. Keep it concise.\n</think>\n\nCanadian Hydro Developers, Inc., founded in 1989 by John and Ross Keating with Jack McCleary, operated 12 hydroelectric, 8 wind, and 1 biomass power sites in Canada, expanding through strategic acquisitions like Canadian Renewable Energy Corporation (2005), Vector Wind Energy (2006), and GW Power Corporation (2007). The company focused on renewable energy, leveraging revenue from early hydro projects to fund growth, and diversified into wind power with facilities like the 197.8 MW Wolfe Island Wind Project. In 2009, TransAlta acquired the firm for $5.25 per share, marking the end of its independent operations. Its generating facilities included run-of-river hydro plants, wind farms with turbines from brands like GE and Nordex, and a biomass site in Alberta.",
