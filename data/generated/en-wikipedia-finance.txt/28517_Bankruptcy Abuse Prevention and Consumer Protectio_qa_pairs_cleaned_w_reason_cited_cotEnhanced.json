  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA) in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the document to understand the main points.\n\nThe document explains that BAPCPA was enacted to make it harder for consumers to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, pushing them towards Chapter 13. Key provisions include the means test, which determines if a debtor's income is above the state median, leading to a presumption of abuse. There's also a waiting period between filings, credit counseling requirements, and changes to the automatic stay. The act aimed to prevent abuse and protect creditors, but faced criticism for making bankruptcy more difficult for those in financial distress. It also had impacts on business bankruptcies and financial derivatives.\n\nI need to make sure I capture the main topic, which is BAPCPA, and the key concepts like the means test, Chapter 7 vs. Chapter 13, credit counseling, and the criticisms. I should mention the intent of the law, its provisions, and the reactions to it. Let me check if I missed any major points. The document also talks about the legislative history, support from creditors, and effects on the 2008 crisis. But for a concise summary, maybe focus on the main provisions and the debate around it. Avoid too many details on specific cases or the financial crisis unless necessary. Keep it to 3-5 sentences, so I need to be concise.\n</think>\n\nThe **Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA)** aimed to curb perceived abuses in the U.S. bankruptcy system by making Chapter 7 filings more difficult, shifting debtors toward Chapter 13 repayment plans, and introducing stricter requirements like the **means test** to assess eligibility. Key provisions included a **presumption of abuse** for debtors above state median incomes, extended waiting periods between filings, mandatory credit counseling, and limitations on exemptions and the automatic stay. While intended to protect creditors and reduce fraud, BAPCPA faced criticism for disproportionately burdening low-income individuals, increasing bankruptcy costs, and failing to address systemic issues like predatory lending, with some arguing it exacerbated financial instability during crises like the 2008 recession.",

[S2] L. [S3] 109–8 (text) (PDF), 119 Stat. [S4] 23, enacted April 20, 2005) is a legislative act that made several significant changes to the United States Bankruptcy Code. [S5] Referred to colloquially as the \"New Bankruptcy Law\", the Act of Congress attempts to, among other things, make it more difficult for some consumers to file bankruptcy under Chapter 7; some of these consumers may instead utilize Chapter 13. [S6] It was passed by the 109th United States Congress on April 14, 2005, and signed into law by President George W. [S7] Bush on April 20, 2005. [S8] Provisions of the act apply to cases filed on or after October 17, 2005. [S9] ## Provisions\n\nThe Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) made changes to American bankruptcy laws, affecting both consumer and business bankruptcies. [S10] Many of the bill's provisions were explicitly designed by the bill's Congressional sponsors to make it \"more difficult for people to file for bankruptcy.\" The BAPCPA was intended to make it more difficult for debtors to file a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy—under which most debts are forgiven (or discharged)—and instead required them to file a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy—under which the debts they incurred are discharged only after the debtor has repaid some portion of these debts. [S11] Some of the bill's more significant provisions include the following:\n\n\n### Presumption of abuse\n\nPrior to the BAPCPA Amendments, debtors of all incomes could file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. [S12] BAPCPA restricted the number of debtors that could declare Chapter 7 bankruptcy. [S13] The act sets out a method to calculate a debtor's income, and compares this amount to the median income of the debtor's state. [S14] If the debtor's income is above the median income amount of the debtor's state, the debtor is subject to a \"means test.\"\n\nThe most noteworthy change brought by the 2005 BAPCPA amendments occurred within 11 U.S.C. [S15] § 707(b). [S16] Congress amended this section of the Bankruptcy Code to provide for the dismissal or conversion of a Chapter 7 case upon a finding of \"abuse\" by an individual debtor (or married couple) with \"primarily consumer debt\". [S17] The pre-BAPCPA language of § 707(b) provided for dismissal of a chapter 7 case upon a finding of \"substantial abuse\". [S18] Under the former § 707(b), only the court or the United States trustee could bring a motion to find abuse under the section. [S19] The 2005 amendments removed these restrictions. [S20] Post-BAPCPA, § 707(b) provides two definitions of \"abuse\". [S21] \"Abuse\" may be found when there is an unrebutted \"presumption of abuse\" arising under a BAPCPA-created \"means test\", [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S22] § 707(b)(2)], or through a finding of bad faith, determined by a totality of the circumstances [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S23] § 707(b)(3)]. [S24] #### Means test\n\nOnly debtors whose monthly income is higher than the median income of their state, as calculated by the Code, are subject to being found abusive under § 707(b)(2). [S25] Debtors whose income falls below the median income figure may be in violation of the means test, however no party is permitted to file a motion in order to find abuse under § 707(b)(2), [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S26] § 707(b)(7)]. [S27] This creates a means test \"safe harbor\" for debtors below the state's median income figure.",

      "reasoning": "The passage explicitly states in [S10] that 'The applicable median income figure is adjusted by family size.'

[S2] § 707(b)(7)]. [S3] This creates a means test \"safe harbor\" for debtors below the state's median income figure. [S4] Current monthly income is defined in 11 U.S.C. [S5] § 101(10A) as the monthly average of the income received by the debtor (and the debtor's spouse in a joint case) during a defined six-month time period prior to the filing of the bankruptcy case. [S6] Some narrow classes of payments, for example, social security, are excluded from these figures. [S7] Notably, the average income may be higher or lower than the debtor's actual income at the time of filing for bankruptcy. [S8] This has led some commentators to refer to the bankruptcy code's \"current monthly income\" as \"presumed income\". [S9] If the debtor's debt is not primarily consumer debt, then the means test is inapplicable. [S10] The applicable median income figure is adjusted by family size. [S11] Generally, the larger the family, the greater the applicable median income figure and the more money the debtor must earn before a presumption of abuse arises. [S12] A chart of the most recent applicable median incomes by state can be found at the US Trustee's website. [S13] This code section then requires a comparison between the debtor's \"current monthly income\" and the median income for the debtor's state. [S14] If the debtor's income exceeds the median income, then the debtor must apply the means test. [S15] For debtors subject to the means test, the test is calculated as follows. [S16] The debtor's \"current monthly income\" is reduced by a set of allowed deductions specified by the IRS. [S17] These deductions are not necessarily the actual expenses the debtor incurs on a monthly basis. [S18] Some commentators have referred to these deductions as \"presumed expenses\". [S19] The deductions applicable in the \"means test\" are defined in 11 U.S.C. [S20] § 707(b)(2)(A), (ii)-(iv) and include:\n\n* living expenses specified under the \"collection standards of the Internal Revenue Service\",\n* actual expenses not provided by the Internal Revenue Standards including \"reasonably necessary health insurance, disability insurance, and health savings account expenses\",\n* expenses for protection from family violence,\n* continued contributions to care of nondependent family members,\n* actual expenses of administering a chapter 13 plan,\n* expenses for grade and high school, up to $1,500 annually per minor child provided that the expenses are reasonable and necessary,\n* additional home energy costs in addition to those laid out in the IRS guidelines that are reasonable and necessary,\n* 1/60th of all secured debt that will become due in the five years after the filing of the bankruptcy case,\n* 1/60th of all priority debt, and\n* continued contributions to tax-exempt charities. [S21] An itemized list of the applicable IRS living standards can be found at the US Trustee's website. [S22] A \"presumption of abuse\" will arise if: (1) the debtor has at least $182.50 in current monthly income available after the allowed deductions (this equals $10,950 over five years) regardless of the amount of debt, or (2) the debtor has at least $109.59 of such income ($6,575 over five years) and this sum would be enough to pay general unsecured creditors more than 25% over five years. [S23] For example, if a debtor had exactly $109.59 of \"current monthly income\" left after deductions and owed less than $26,300 in general unsecured debt, then the presumption of abuse would arise, [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S24] § 707(b)(2)(A)(i)]. [S25] If a presumption of abuse is found under the means test, it may only be rebutted in the case of \"special circumstances\", [*see* 11 U.S.C. [S26] § 707(b)(2)(B)].

[S5] BAPCPA limited the protections the stay provides in some re-filed cases.

[S7] If the present case is a third filing within one year, the automatic stay does not go into effect at all, unless the debtor or any other party in interest files a motion to impose the stay that demonstrates that the third filing is in good faith with respect to the creditor, or creditors, being stayed. [S8] The provision presumes that the repeat filings are not in good faith and requires the party seeking to impose the stay (usually the debtor) to rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence. [S9] There are exceptions. [S10] Notably, § 362(i) provides that the presumption that the repeat filing was not in good faith would not arise in a \"subsequent\" case if a debtor's prior case was dismissed \"due to the creation of a debt repayment plan.\"\n\nBAPCPA also limited the applicability of the automatic stay in eviction proceedings. [S11] The stay does not stop an eviction proceeding if the landlord has already obtained a judgment of possession prior to the bankruptcy case being filed, § 362(b)(22). [S12] The stay also would not apply in a situation where the eviction is based on \"endangerment\" of the rented property or \"illegal use of controlled substances\" on the property, § 362(b)(23). [S13] In either situation the landlord must file with the court and serve on the debtor a certificate of non-applicability of the stay spelling out the facts giving rise to one of the exceptions. [S14] There is a process for the debtor to contest the assertions in the landlord's certificate or if state law gives the debtor an additional right to cure the default even after an order for possession is entered, § 362(l) & (m).

[S3] ### Dischargeability\n\nBAPCPA also provided more protections to creditors because it expanded the exceptions to discharge. [S4] The presumption of fraud in the use of credit cards was expanded. [S5] The amount that the debtor must charge for \"luxury goods\" to invoke the presumption is reduced from $1,225 to $500. [S6] The amount of cash advances that would give rise to a presumption of fraud has also been reduced, from $1,225 to $750. [S7] The time period was increased from 60 days to 90 days. [S8] Thus, if a debtor purchases any single item for more than $500 within 90 days of filing, the presumption that the debt was incurred fraudulently and therefore non-dischargeable in the bankruptcy arises. [S9] Prior to BAPCPA, the presumption would not have arisen unless the purchase was for more than $1,225 and was made within 60 days of filing (§ 523(a)(2)(C)).

[S11] Thus, even loans from \"for-profit\" or \"non-governmental\" entities are not dischargeable. [S12] ### Lien avoidance\n\nSome types of liens may be avoided through a chapter 7 bankruptcy case. [S13] However, BAPCPA limited the ability of debtors to avoid liens through bankruptcy. [S14] The definition of \"household goods\" was changed—for example, by limiting \"electronic equipment\" to one radio, one television, one VCR, and one personal computer with related equipment. [S15] The definition now excludes certain items such as works of art not created by the debtor or a relative of the debtor, jewelry worth more than $500, with adjustment for inflation (except wedding rings), and motor vehicles. [S16] Prior to BAPCPA, the definition of household goods was broader so that more items could have been included, including more than one television, VCR, radio, etc. [S17] ### Limits to the homestead exemption\n\nUnder the new law, the homestead exemption, which allows bankruptcy filers in some states to exempt the value of their homes from creditors, is limited in various ways. [S18] If a filer acquired their home less than 1,215 days (40 months) before filing, or if they have been convicted of security law violations or been found guilty of certain crimes, they may only exempt up to $125,000 (adjusted periodically), regardless of a state's exemption allowance.(§ 522(p)(1)). [S19] Filers must also wait 730 days before they are allowed to use their state's exemptions. [S20] (§ 522(b)(3)(A)). [S21] There is an exception if the property is \"reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and any dependent of the debtor.\"\n\nThese provisions were largely intended to prevent filers from forum shopping, i.e. [S22] moving assets and domiciles to a state with more favorable exemptions and filing. [S23] ### Exemptions\n\nBAPCPA attempted to eliminate the perceived \"forum shopping\" by changing the rules on claiming exemptions. [S24] Exemptions define the amount of property debtors may protect from liquidation to pay creditors. [S25] Typically, every state has exemption laws that define the amount of property that can be protected from creditor collection action within the state. [S26] There is also a federal statute that defines exemptions in federal cases. [S27] In bankruptcy, Congress allowed states to opt out of the federal exemption scheme.

[S5] * The law improves the ability of the bankruptcy estate to reclaim assets placed in asset protection trusts within ten years of filing or paid as employment bonuses to insiders within two years prior to filing. [S6] * The law makes Chapter 12 bankruptcy (farm reorganization) permanent while adding family fishermen, overhauls the treatment of complex financial contracts including many derivative contracts used by hedge funds, and overhauls the treatment of ancillary foreign bankruptcy proceedings.

[S10] ## Legislative history\n\nThe 2005 bankruptcy bill was actually first drafted in 1997 and first introduced in 1998. [S11] The United States House of Representatives approved a version titled the \"Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999\" and the Senate approved a slightly different version in 2000. [S12] After the differences in the bills were reconciled, Congress passed the \"Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2000\". [S13] President Clinton, however, employed what is known as a \"pocket veto\" by waiting for the lame duck congressional session to adjourn without signing the bill, a legislative maneuver tantamount to a veto. [S14] Professor Elizabeth Warren, a member of the National Bankruptcy Review Commission at that time, briefed First Lady Clinton on negative effects of the bill; according to Warren, after the briefing:\n\n> President Clinton had been showing that this is another way that he could be helpful to business. [S15] It wasn't a very high visibility bill. [S16] And when Mrs. [S17] Clinton came back with a little better understanding of how it all worked, they reversed course, and they reversed course fast. [S18] And indeed, the proof is in the pudding. [S19] > The last bill that came before President Clinton was that bankruptcy bill that was passed by the House and the Senate in 2000 and he vetoed it. [S20] And in her autobiography, Mrs. [S21] Clinton took credit for that veto and she rightly should. [S22] She turned around a whole administration on the subject of bankruptcy. [S23] She got it. [S24] In the years since 2000, the bill was introduced in each Congress, but was repeatedly shelved due to threats of a filibuster from its opponents and because of disagreements over various amendments, including one backed by Senate Democrats that would have made it harder for anti-abortion groups to discharge court fines related to legal debts incurred from lawsuits filed by pro-abortion groups.",

      "chunk": "[S1] * *Increased amount of debt repayment under Chapter 13*. [S2] The new law made several changes that effectively increased the amount of debt that Chapter 13 filers will have to repay. [S3] ### Other changes\n\n* The new law allows creditors to pursue collection remedies without court permission in various circumstances such as offsetting tax refunds, pursuing tax and domestic relations litigation in all respects except the final turnover of assets from the estate, establishing wage assignments in domestic relations actions, repossessing vehicles and personal property subject to loans or leases 45 days after the first meeting of creditors in cases where no court action has been taken regarding that property, and allowing evictions that completed the court process prior to the filing of the petition or involve endangerment to property or drug use to proceed. [S4] The law also makes it easier for creditors who received preferential payments of less than $5,000 from the debtor before bankruptcy to avoid repaying such payments for the benefit of all creditors. [S5] * The law improves the ability of the bankruptcy estate to reclaim assets placed in asset protection trusts within ten years of filing or paid as employment bonuses to insiders within two years prior to filing. [S6] * The law makes Chapter 12 bankruptcy (farm reorganization) permanent while adding family fishermen, overhauls the treatment of complex financial contracts including many derivative contracts used by hedge funds, and overhauls the treatment of ancillary foreign bankruptcy proceedings. [S7] * The law extends protection to non-ERISA pension plans like private sector 403(b)s and some Individual Retirement Account that ERISA plans had enjoyed thereby making these plans more similar to ERISA plans. [S8] * The law raises the priority status for payment of domestic support obligations (such as alimony and child support) from seventh place to first, only behind the administrative expenses of the trustee. [S9] This means that domestic support claimants get paid before all other unsecured creditors. [S10] ## Legislative history\n\nThe 2005 bankruptcy bill was actually first drafted in 1997 and first introduced in 1998. [S11] The United States House of Representatives approved a version titled the \"Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999\" and the Senate approved a slightly different version in 2000. [S12] After the differences in the bills were reconciled, Congress passed the \"Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2000\". [S13] President Clinton, however, employed what is known as a \"pocket veto\" by waiting for the lame duck congressional session to adjourn without signing the bill, a legislative maneuver tantamount to a veto. [S14] Professor Elizabeth Warren, a member of the National Bankruptcy Review Commission at that time, briefed First Lady Clinton on negative effects of the bill; according to Warren, after the briefing:\n\n> President Clinton had been showing that this is another way that he could be helpful to business. [S15] It wasn't a very high visibility bill. [S16] And when Mrs. [S17] Clinton came back with a little better understanding of how it all worked, they reversed course, and they reversed course fast. [S18] And indeed, the proof is in the pudding. [S19] > The last bill that came before President Clinton was that bankruptcy bill that was passed by the House and the Senate in 2000 and he vetoed it. [S20] And in her autobiography, Mrs. [S21] Clinton took credit for that veto and she rightly should. [S22] She turned around a whole administration on the subject of bankruptcy. [S23] She got it. [S24] In the years since 2000, the bill was introduced in each Congress, but was repeatedly shelved due to threats of a filibuster from its opponents and because of disagreements over various amendments, including one backed by Senate Democrats that would have made it harder for anti-abortion groups to discharge court fines related to legal debts incurred from lawsuits filed by pro-abortion groups.",

[S10] The United States Trustee program has since said it would not attempt to enforce the means test rules for disaster victims, including those affected by Hurricane Katrina.

[S12] Despite these assurances, bankruptcy judges are still able to enforce these rules *sua sponte*. [S13] The Department of Justice also indicated it would not oppose a debtor's eligibility to file bankruptcy because the debtor did not fulfill the credit counseling requirements before filing.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ U.S. [S14] Trustees have the discretion to grant waivers of the credit counseling requirements to debtors.

[S18] Some observers have argued that this contributed to the financial crisis of 2008 by removing the incentive that creditors would normally have to keep a borrower out of bankruptcy. [S19] Institutions who provided short-term funding to financial firms such as Bear Stearns and Lehman through repo lending could abruptly withdraw that funding even if it risked pushing the firms into bankruptcy, because they did not have to worry about tying up their claims in bankruptcy court, due to the new safe harbor provisions of BAPCPA.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ\n\n\n## Case law interpreting the Act\n\n* *Ransom v.

[S2] These criticisms were partly borne out in the months following the new law, as lawyers have reported that the bankruptcy process has become significantly more arduous, forcing them to charge higher fees and take fewer clients. [S3] One criticism of the law was that the law made the discharge of liability for medical bills more difficult. [S4] A major target of the bill's opponents were provisions they described as beneficial to credit card companies. [S5] In particular, critics objected to the extension to eight years from six to the time before which debtors could liquidate their debts through bankruptcy, and requirements that those who file for multiple bankruptcies pay previous credit card debt that would have been forgiven under the old law. [S6] The bill's opponents were especially critical of provisions that expanded exemptions to the discharge of credit card debt, forcing spouses owed alimony to compete more often with credit card companies and other lenders for their unpaid child support. [S7] More broadly the bill's critics argued that the legislation did nothing to curtail what they characterize as predatory practices of credit card companies, such as exorbitant interest rates, rising and often hidden fees, and targeting minors and the recently bankrupt for new cards. [S8] The bill's critics argue that these practices are themselves significant contributors to the growth of consumer bankruptcies. [S9] ## Hurricane Katrina bankruptcies\n\nJim Sensenbrenner, Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee claimed: \"If someone in Katrina is down and out, and has no possibility of being able to repay 40 percent or more of their debts, then the new bankruptcy law doesn't apply. [S10] The United States Trustee program has since said it would not attempt to enforce the means test rules for disaster victims, including those affected by Hurricane Katrina. [S11] The Justice Department Trustees oversee the administration of bankruptcy law and are able to file the motions necessary to enforce the means test. [S12] Despite these assurances, bankruptcy judges are still able to enforce these rules *sua sponte*. [S13] The Department of Justice also indicated it would not oppose a debtor's eligibility to file bankruptcy because the debtor did not fulfill the credit counseling requirements before filing.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ U.S. [S14] Trustees have the discretion to grant waivers of the credit counseling requirements to debtors. [S15] *See* 11 U.S.C. [S16] § 109(h)(2). [S17] ## 2007–2008 financial crisis\n\nAs the *Financial Times* noted during the fall of 2008, \"the 2005 changes made clear that certain derivatives and financial transactions were exempt from provisions in the bankruptcy code that freeze a failed company's assets until a court decides how to apportion them among creditors.\" This radically altered the historic process of paying off creditors and did so just a few years prior to trillions of dollars in assets going into liquidation as a consequence of bankruptcies following the 2007–2008 financial crisis. [S18] Some observers have argued that this contributed to the financial crisis of 2008 by removing the incentive that creditors would normally have to keep a borrower out of bankruptcy. [S19] Institutions who provided short-term funding to financial firms such as Bear Stearns and Lehman through repo lending could abruptly withdraw that funding even if it risked pushing the firms into bankruptcy, because they did not have to worry about tying up their claims in bankruptcy court, due to the new safe harbor provisions of BAPCPA.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ\n\n\n## Case law interpreting the Act\n\n* *Ransom v. [S20] FIA Card Services, N. [S21] A.*, 562 U.S. [S22] \\_\\_\\_ (2011), involving the Chapter 13 means test",
