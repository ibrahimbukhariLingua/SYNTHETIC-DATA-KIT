  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the franga in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main topic is the franga, an obsolete Albanian currency unit. It was equal to 5 lek and used from 1926 to 1939 under the Albanian Republic and Kingdom. The document mentions coins and banknotes. \n\nCoins: 1, 2, 5 franga in silver, and 10, 20, 50, 100 in gold. Also, fractional coins in lek and qindarka. \n\nBanknotes: 1, 5, 20, 100 franga issued in 1926, with the 1-franga note recalled. In 1939, during the Italian occupation, 100 franga notes were overprinted to remove King Zog's image.\n\nKey points: the franga's usage period, denominations of coins and banknotes, the overprinting during occupation. Need to make sure the summary includes the main topic, key concepts like the time frame, denominations, and the historical context of the overprinting. Avoid minor details like the exact silver purity unless necessary. Keep it concise.\n</think>\n\nThe **franga** was an obsolete Albanian currency unit, equivalent to 5 lek, used from 1926 to 1939 during the Albanian Republic and Kingdom under Zogu. It featured silver coins (1, 2, 5 franga) and gold coins (10, 20, 50, 100 franga), alongside fractional lek and qindarka denominations. Banknotes issued by the National Bank of Albania in 1926 included 1, 5, 20, and 100 franga, with the 1-franga note later recalled. During the 1939 Italian occupation, 100-franga notes were overprinted to remove King Zog I's image, marking the currency's historical transition.",
