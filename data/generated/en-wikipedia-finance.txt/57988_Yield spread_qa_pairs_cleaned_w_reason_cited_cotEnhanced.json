  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document on yield spread in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document explains that a yield spread, or credit spread, is the difference in yields between two investments, usually with different credit qualities but similar maturities. It mentions that this spread indicates the risk premium. There are different types like I-spread, Z-spread, and OAS. Also, it talks about comparing bonds of different maturities and the term premium. \n\nThen there's a section on yield spread analysis, where comparing yields, maturities, liquidity, and creditworthiness helps track market perceptions of risk. Examples like the TED spread and Baa-rated corporate bonds vs. Treasuries are given. The document also mentions consumer loans, where yield spread is the difference between the rate a borrower pays and the rate they qualify for, affecting lender profitability.\n\nI need to capture the main points: definition, types of spreads, analysis, examples, and application in consumer loans. Make sure to mention the key concepts like risk premium, benchmark comparisons, and the different types of spreads. Also, note the examples like TED spread and how it's used in both corporate and consumer contexts. Keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Avoid jargon where possible, but since it's a summary, some terms are necessary. Check that each sentence covers a distinct aspect without overlapping too much.\n</think>\n\nThe **yield spread** (or credit spread) measures the difference in yields between two financial instruments, typically reflecting the risk premium for lower-credit-quality investments relative to higher-quality benchmarks like government bonds. It is calculated as the yield to maturity (YTM) of one instrument minus another, with variations like interpolated spread (I-spread), zero-volatility spread (Z-spread), and option-adjusted spread (OAS) used for different analytical purposes. Yield spread analysis tracks how these differences evolve, signaling market perceptions of credit risk—wider spreads indicate higher default risk, while narrower spreads suggest improved economic outlooks. Additionally, in consumer lending, yield spread reflects the profit margin for lenders when borrowers pay higher interest rates than their credit profile would justify, influencing strategies like yield spread premiums for brokers.",

      "reasoning": "The answer cites [S2], which states 'It is often an indication of the risk premium for one investment product over another.' However, the definition of yield spread is provided in the passage's main text, not in [S2]. The cited sentence [S2] explains the purpose of yield spread (risk premium) rather than defining it. Since the answer's statement matches the definition in the passage but the citation [S2] does not directly support it, the reasoning is invalid. Therefore, the citation does not align with the answer.",

[S2] It is often an indication of the risk premium for one investment product over another. [S3] The phrase is a compound of yield and spread. [S4] The \"yield spread of X over Y\" is generally the annualized percentage yield to maturity (YTM) of financial instrument X minus the YTM of financial instrument Y. [S5] There are several measures of yield spread relative to a benchmark yield curve, including interpolated spread (I-spread), zero-volatility spread (Z-spread), and option-adjusted spread (OAS). [S6] It is also possible to define a yield spread between two different maturities of otherwise comparable bonds. [S7] For example, if a certain bond with a 10-year maturity yields 8% and a comparable bond from the same issuer with a 5-year maturity yields 5%, then the term premium between them may be quoted as 8% – 5% = 3%. [S8] A \"credit spread curve\" (usually, positively sloped) depicts the relationship between credit spread and maturity, i.e. [S9] term structure; curves may also be constructed for credit structure. [S10] ## Yield spread analysis\n\nYield spread analysis involves comparing the yield, maturity, liquidity and creditworthiness of two instruments, or of one security relative to a benchmark, and tracking how particular patterns vary over time. [S11] When yield spreads widen between bond categories with different credit ratings, all else equal, it implies that the market is factoring more risk of default on the lower-grade bonds. [S12] For example, if a risk-free 10-year Treasury note is currently yielding 5% while junk bonds with the same duration are averaging 7%, then the spread between Treasuries and junk bonds is 2%. [S13] If that spread widens to 4% (increasing the junk bond yield to 9%), then the market is forecasting a greater risk of default, probably because of weaker economic prospects for the borrowers. [S14] A narrowing of yield spreads (between bonds of different risk ratings) implies that the market is factoring in less risk, probably due to an improving economic outlook.

Sentence [S2] explicitly states that yield spread 'is often an indication of the risk premium for one investment product over another.' This directly supports the answer by linking the concept of yield spread to the risk premium, as the difference in returns compensates investors for assuming higher risk.

      "reasoning": "The passage explains that when a borrower accepts a higher interest rate than their credit quality would typically allow, the difference between the actual rate paid and the lower rate they could have received is termed a 'yield spread' (S4). This is illustrated in S5, where a borrower paying 6% instead of a 5% rate (due to their creditworthiness) creates a 1% yield spread. This extra 1% directly translates to additional profit for the lender, as the lender receives more interest income than the risk-adjusted rate they could have charged. Thus, the cited sentences support the answer by defining the yield spread and demonstrating its financial impact on the lender.",
