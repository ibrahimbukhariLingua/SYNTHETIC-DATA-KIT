  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Eugene Zimmerman in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document begins by introducing Eugene Zimmerman as an American industrialist and railroad owner. He made his wealth through Standard Oil shares and invested in railroads. His early life includes his birth in Mississippi, family background, and education. Then there's his career, both in the Civil War and his business ventures. He was involved in various railroads, including the Cincinnati and Green River Railroad, and had a partnership with Collis P. Huntington. Later, he was involved in several railway companies and had a significant estate. His personal life includes his marriage, daughter, and family details. The summary needs to focus on the main topic and key concepts.\n\nKey points: Industrialist, railroad owner, Standard Oil stockholder, Civil War service, railroad investments, business ventures, partnerships, estate, personal life. I should mention his role in Standard Oil, his railroad empire, and his legacy. Also, note his death and estate. Avoid minor details like specific dates of marriages or descendants unless crucial. Make sure to highlight his contributions to railroads and his financial dealings. Check for any other important aspects like the Interstate Commerce Commission testimony. But maybe that's too detailed. Keep it concise. Let me structure the sentences to cover his main achievements and impact.\n</think>\n\nEugene Zimmerman was an American industrialist and railroad magnate who accumulated wealth through strategic investments in John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil and later expanded his influence by acquiring and managing multiple railroads, including the Cincinnati and Green River Railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. A Civil War veteran, he leveraged his post-war business acumen to build a vast transportation network, forming key partnerships and navigating complex financial dealings, such as his involvement in the Père Marquette system and testimony before the Interstate Commerce Commission. His legacy includes a substantial estate and a lasting impact on mid-19th-century infrastructure, though his personal life, marked by familial ties and financial entanglements, also reflected the complexities of his era. Zimmerman's career exemplifies the intersection of industrial growth, railroad expansion, and corporate finance in 19th-century America.",

[S2] He amassed great wealth as a stockholder or shareholder in John D. [S3] Rockefeller's Standard Oil. [S4] He used the income from his Standard Oil holdings to invest in railroads. [S5] ## Early life\n\nZimmerman was born in Vicksburg, Warren County, Mississippi, on December 17, 1845. [S6] He was son of Solomon Zimmerman (Kingston, Ross County, Ohio, 1807 – Clifton, Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio, 13 May 1859) and wife (Vicksburg, Warren County, Mississippi, 27 February 1845) Hannah J. [S7] Biggs (Pennsylvania, 1824 – Clifton, Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio, 14 July 1861) and paternal grandson of Martin Zimmerman and wife Barbara Pontius. [S8] His younger brother was Martin Zimmerman and his younger sister was Ellen (née Zimmerman) Laird. [S9] After his father's death, his mother remarried to Andrew Jackson LaBoiteaux in November 1859 in Hamilton County, Ohio, before her death in 1861. [S10] His grandfather was an officer in the Dutch Army. [S11] His father had moved to Mississippi from Ohio to inherit a foundry and several slaves. [S12] Eugene grew up at the family's business and was sent to Cincinnati in 1859 to attend Farmer's College. [S13] In the spring of 1861, he began attending the preparatory school Gambier Academy with the intention of attending Kenyon College. [S14] ## Career\n\nUpon the outbreak of the Civil War, Zimmerman left the academy and tried to join the Union Navy, but was refused because he was too young. [S15] After some modifications, he was accepted, becoming a Master's mate and was assigned to the Mississippi River Squadron. [S16] While in the Navy, his ship was struck by torpedo which killed several seamen and threw him into the Yazoo River. [S17] He participated in the Battle of Saint Charles and Duvall's Bluffs and served with distinction during the capture of Arkansas Post in 1863, after which he was promoted to Ensign. [S18] During the Vicksburg campaign in his hometown, Zimmerman was placed in charge of a mortar boat and sent up the Yazoo River, making a successful run against the Confederate blockade at Vicksburg in April 1863. [S19] During the campaign, he was involved in several missions and was promoted to acting Master and Officer of the side wheel steamer USS Ouachita after the surrender of Vicksburg which he held until the end of the War. [S20] During the siege, his former home and his father's business were destroyed. [S21] During the remainder of the war, he was eventually made a Lieutenant and a ship commander at the age of nineteen (the youngest officer at his rank in the entire U.S. [S22] Navy). [S23] After the War, he resigned his commission, was honorably discharged, and returned to Ohio. [S24] ### Business career\n\nAfter the war, he went into the oil business, acquiring extensive holdings which he sold to John D. [S25] Rockefeller in exchange for shares in Standard Oil where he became a substantial stockholder and gained seat on the company's board. [S26] In 1875, Zimmerman purchased more than 13,000 acres of timberland in what is now Yosemite in Casey County, Kentucky. [S27] He ran a lumber mill there and built a wooden train track from Kings Mountain to Staffordsville in 1884, later organizing the Green River Railway Co. [S28] He used his income to invest in railroads and was president of the Cincinnati and Green River Railroad, and the Kentucky and South Atlantic Railroad, which later became a part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway after he sold it to Collis P. [S29] Huntington which led to a long partnership with Huntington, including looking after his interests in the Midwest. [S30] In 1882, he became president of the Chesapeake and Nashville Railway (and constructed the Chesapeake and Ohio Bridge at Cincinnati for Huntington), and in 1888 he was elected president of Dayton, Forth Wayne and Chicago Railway.",

      "chunk": "[S1] Eugene Zimmerman (industrialist)\n\n\n# Eugene Zimmerman (industrialist)\n\n\n\n**Eugene Zimmerman** (December 17, 1845 – December 20, 1914) was an American industrialist and railroad owner. [S2] He amassed great wealth as a stockholder or shareholder in John D. [S3] Rockefeller's Standard Oil. [S4] He used the income from his Standard Oil holdings to invest in railroads. [S5] ## Early life\n\nZimmerman was born in Vicksburg, Warren County, Mississippi, on December 17, 1845. [S6] He was son of Solomon Zimmerman (Kingston, Ross County, Ohio, 1807 – Clifton, Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio, 13 May 1859) and wife (Vicksburg, Warren County, Mississippi, 27 February 1845) Hannah J. [S7] Biggs (Pennsylvania, 1824 – Clifton, Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio, 14 July 1861) and paternal grandson of Martin Zimmerman and wife Barbara Pontius. [S8] His younger brother was Martin Zimmerman and his younger sister was Ellen (née Zimmerman) Laird. [S9] After his father's death, his mother remarried to Andrew Jackson LaBoiteaux in November 1859 in Hamilton County, Ohio, before her death in 1861. [S10] His grandfather was an officer in the Dutch Army. [S11] His father had moved to Mississippi from Ohio to inherit a foundry and several slaves. [S12] Eugene grew up at the family's business and was sent to Cincinnati in 1859 to attend Farmer's College. [S13] In the spring of 1861, he began attending the preparatory school Gambier Academy with the intention of attending Kenyon College. [S14] ## Career\n\nUpon the outbreak of the Civil War, Zimmerman left the academy and tried to join the Union Navy, but was refused because he was too young. [S15] After some modifications, he was accepted, becoming a Master's mate and was assigned to the Mississippi River Squadron. [S16] While in the Navy, his ship was struck by torpedo which killed several seamen and threw him into the Yazoo River. [S17] He participated in the Battle of Saint Charles and Duvall's Bluffs and served with distinction during the capture of Arkansas Post in 1863, after which he was promoted to Ensign. [S18] During the Vicksburg campaign in his hometown, Zimmerman was placed in charge of a mortar boat and sent up the Yazoo River, making a successful run against the Confederate blockade at Vicksburg in April 1863. [S19] During the campaign, he was involved in several missions and was promoted to acting Master and Officer of the side wheel steamer USS Ouachita after the surrender of Vicksburg which he held until the end of the War. [S20] During the siege, his former home and his father's business were destroyed. [S21] During the remainder of the war, he was eventually made a Lieutenant and a ship commander at the age of nineteen (the youngest officer at his rank in the entire U.S. [S22] Navy). [S23] After the War, he resigned his commission, was honorably discharged, and returned to Ohio. [S24] ### Business career\n\nAfter the war, he went into the oil business, acquiring extensive holdings which he sold to John D. [S25] Rockefeller in exchange for shares in Standard Oil where he became a substantial stockholder and gained seat on the company's board. [S26] In 1875, Zimmerman purchased more than 13,000 acres of timberland in what is now Yosemite in Casey County, Kentucky. [S27] He ran a lumber mill there and built a wooden train track from Kings Mountain to Staffordsville in 1884, later organizing the Green River Railway Co. [S28] He used his income to invest in railroads and was president of the Cincinnati and Green River Railroad, and the Kentucky and South Atlantic Railroad, which later became a part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway after he sold it to Collis P. [S29] Huntington which led to a long partnership with Huntington, including looking after his interests in the Midwest. [S30] In 1882, he became president of the Chesapeake and Nashville Railway (and constructed the Chesapeake and Ohio Bridge at Cincinnati for Huntington), and in 1888 he was elected president of Dayton, Forth Wayne and Chicago Railway.",

[S3] In 1882, he became president of the Chesapeake and Nashville Railway (and constructed the Chesapeake and Ohio Bridge at Cincinnati for Huntington), and in 1888 he was elected president of Dayton, Forth Wayne and Chicago Railway. [S4] In 1904, he was made president of the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway, and succeeded in getting the Queen and Crescent as its tributary and gaining control of the Père Marquette system, and the Chicago, Cincinnati and St. [S5] Louis Railroad. [S6] George M. [S7] Cumming, a lawyer with the United States Mortgage and Trust Company of New York, was elected vice president to represent the interest of New York capital. [S8] In 1906, along with his son-in-law, he toured the route of the proposed Newry, Keady Tynan Railway in Ireland to see whether to build a railway there. [S9] In June 1905, Cumming was elected president of the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad and served for one month; he was succeeded by F. [S10] A.

[S12] The Detroit, Toledo & Ironton Railway had taken control of the Ann Arbor Railroad from Rudolph Kleybolte & Co. [S13] in June 1905. [S14] The acquisition connected Toledo with Frankfort, Michigan, and essentially doubled the DT&I system.

[S17] He continued to be a director of Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Western Railway, the Birmingham and Atlantic Railway and the North Alabama Coal and Iron Company. [S18] Henry Ford later bought DT&I in 1920. [S19] At the time of his death, he was preparing to testify before Commissioner Henry Clay Hall of the Interstate Commerce Commission regarding the sale of the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad and the Père Marquette to J.P. [S20] Morgan & Co., for which Zimmerman made a profit of more than $1,000,000. [S21] Testimony given before the Commission told how J. [S22] Pierpont Morgan suffered a $12,00,000 loss when he acquired the Zimmerman's Great Central system, then failed to sell it to the Erie Railroad, and \"was forced to throw the system into the hands of a receiver.\" Frederick W. [S23] Stevens testified that Zimmerman and his associates loaded $24,000,000 worth of obligations on the railroad and took a 999-year lease on the Père Marquette system and guaranteed the road's bonds. [S24] In his later years, he traveled through Europe and Africa. [S25] In 1901, he sailed aboard the Cunard *Umbria* with Miss B. [S26] Evans, his late wife's sister, for a month in Ireland with his daughter at Tandragee Castle in Northern Ireland. [S27] ## Personal life\n\nIn 1878, Zimmerman was married to Marietta A.

[S29] Before her death in December 1882 from peritonitis, they were the parents of one child together: Helena Zimmerman (1878–1971), who married William Montagu, 9th Duke of Manchester in 1900.
