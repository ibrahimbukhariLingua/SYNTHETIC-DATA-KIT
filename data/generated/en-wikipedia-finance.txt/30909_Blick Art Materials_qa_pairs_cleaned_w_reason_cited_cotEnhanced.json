  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Blick Art Materials in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main points seem to be that Blick is a family-owned business established in 1911, originally as a mail-order company. It's now one of the largest art supply suppliers in the US. They have a lot of products, both under their own brand and Utrecht. They have many retail stores, distribution centers, and employ a lot of artists. The history mentions Dick Blick starting it, then Robert Metzenberg taking over in 1947, expanding the business, and the current CEO being Buchsbaum, who got an award. \n\nI should focus on the main topic, which is the company's background, its growth, and key facts. Need to mention the establishment, expansion, product range, retail presence, and maybe the leadership. Avoid too many numbers unless they're key. Also, note that it's family-owned and the significance of their role in the art supply industry. Let me check if I missed anything. The parent company, distribution centers, and the award to Buchsbaum are important. Okay, time to condense this into concise sentences.\n</think>\n\nBlick Art Materials is a family-owned, long-standing U.S. art supply retailer and catalog business, established in 1911 by Dick Blick and later expanded by Robert Metzenberg, becoming one of the largest art material suppliers in the country. The company offers over 90,000 products, including its own brand and Utrecht line, with a network of 65 retail stores, three distribution centers, and a focus on employing artists. It has grown through strategic acquisitions and retail expansion, with a legacy rooted in mail-order sales and a commitment to supporting the arts, recognized by awards like the 2016 Leadership Award to CEO Robert Buchsbaum.",
