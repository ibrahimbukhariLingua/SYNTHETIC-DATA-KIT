  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Kiler (company) in 3-5 sentences. Let me read through the content again to make sure I get the main points.\n\nThe document starts by stating that Kiler is a Turkish company group with a flagship supermarket chain. The history section mentions that the Kiler family started opening supermarkets in Istanbul from 1984, incorporated as a company in 1994. By 2004, they had 33 stores in Istanbul and expanded to other parts of Turkey. By 2010, they had 172 shops across 26 cities, with store sizes ranging from 600 to 2,500 m². \n\nThen, the company is part of Kiler Holding, which has 22 companies with over 5,000 employees. Their sectors include retail, real estate, tourism, and health. Since 2000, real estate is managed by Kiler Gayrimenkul, focusing on residential buildings and shopping centers. The Istanbul Sapphire skyscraper is their flagship project under Kiler GYO.\n\nSo the main topic is Kiler as a Turkish company group with a supermarket chain. Key concepts are their expansion from 1984, growth in stores, diversification into other sectors, and specific projects like the Istanbul Sapphire. I need to condense this into 3-5 sentences, making sure to include the history, expansion, structure (Holding company, subsidiaries), and key projects. Avoid minor details like exact numbers unless they're crucial. Maybe start with the company's main business, then history, expansion, structure, and mention the flagship project. Check for clarity and conciseness.\n</think>\n\nKiler is a Turkish company group primarily known for its supermarket chain, Kiler Supermarket, which began as family-owned stores in Istanbul in 1984 and expanded to 172 locations across 26 cities by 2010. The company is part of Kiler Holding, a diversified entity with 22 subsidiaries operating in retail, real estate, tourism, and healthcare, employing over 5,000 people. Kiler Gayrimenkul, a separate subsidiary, manages real estate development, including residential and commercial projects like the Istanbul Sapphire skyscraper. The group's growth reflects its strategic expansion and diversification beyond retail into key sectors of the Turkish economy.",
