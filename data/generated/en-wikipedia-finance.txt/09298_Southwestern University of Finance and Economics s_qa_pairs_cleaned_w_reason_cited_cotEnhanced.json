  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics station. Let me read through it again.\n\nThe main points are that it's a Chengdu Metro Line 4 station serving the university. The station layout has different levels: G for entrances A, B, D; B1 is the concourse with faregates and a station agent; B2 has the platforms for westbound and eastbound trains. The platforms are island type, with doors on the left. The directions are towards Wansheng and Xihe.\n\nI should focus on the main topic, which is the station's location and its role. Key concepts include the line it's on, the university it serves, the layout details, and the platform directions. Need to keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Avoid too much detail on the layout but mention the entrances, concourse, and platforms. Also note the directions of the trains. Make sure to mention the university's name in Chinese as well. Check for any other important info. I think that's it. Now structure it into a few sentences.\n</think>\n\nSouthwestern University of Finance and Economics station is a Chengdu Metro Line 4 stop serving the nearby Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (Chinese: 西南财大). The station features entrances A, B, and D on the ground level, a concourse (B1) with faregates and a station agent, and an island platform (B2) for westbound and eastbound trains. Trains on Line 4 operate toward Wansheng (Culture Palace) and Xihe (Caotang North Road) from the station. The layout emphasizes accessibility and efficient passenger flow between exits, the concourse, and platforms.",
