Let me make sure to mention the privatization, its role as a leading European telecom, subsidiaries, financials, and recent ventures like 5G and blockchain.

[S11] ## History\n\nThe Deutsche Bundespost was the German federal government postal administration created in 1947 as a successor to the Reichspost. [S12] It was also the major telephone company in West Germany. [S13] On 1 July 1989, as part of a post office reform, Deutsche Bundespost was split into three entities, one being Deutsche Telekom. [S14] On 1 January 1995, as part of another reform, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom became Deutsche Telekom AG, and was privatized in 1996. [S15] As such, it shares a common heritage with the other privatized Deutsche Bundespost companies, Deutsche Post (DHL) and Deutsche Postbank. [S16] Deutsche Telekom was the monopoly Internet service provider (ISP) for Germany until its privatization in 1995, and the dominant ISP thereafter. [S17] Until the early 21st century, Deutsche Telekom controlled almost all Internet access by individuals and small businesses in Germany, as they were one of the first German telecom units. [S18] On 6 December 2001, Deutsche Telekom became the first official partner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. [S19] On 1 January 2005, Deutsche Telekom implemented a new company structure. [S20] The two organizational business units of T-Com and T-Online were merged into the Broadband/Fixed Network (BBFN) strategic business unit (T-Online merged with parent Deutsche Telekom in 2006). [S21] It provides around 40 million narrowband lines, over 9 million broadband lines, and has 14 million registered Internet customers. [S22] In 2008, the structure was changed again. [S23] T-Online was separated from Deutsche Telekom and merged with T-Com to form the new unit T-Home. [S24] In September 2010, Orange parent France Télécom and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom merged their operations in the United Kingdom to create the largest mobile network in Britain, EE. [S25] In April 2010, T-Mobile was merged with T-Home to form Telekom Deutschland GmbH. [S26] This unit now handles all products and services aimed at private customers. [S27] In October 2012, Deutsche Telekom and Orange created a 50-50% joint venture named BuyIn for regrouping their procurement operations and benefiting from economies of scale. [S28] In April 2013, T-Mobile US and MetroPCS merged their operations in the United States. [S29] In February 2014, Deutsche Telekom acquired the remaining parts of its T-Mobile Czech Republic division for around €800 million. [S30] The size of the remaining stake was numbered at 40 percent. [S31] In December 2014, it was announced that Deutsche Telekom were in talks with BT Group on the acquisition of EE, and part of the deal was to provide Deutsche Telekom a 12% stake and a seat on the board in the BT Group upon completion.
