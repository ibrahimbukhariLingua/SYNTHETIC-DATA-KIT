  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about David Foot in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document introduces David K. Foot as a Canadian economist and demographer. He studied at the University of Western Australia and Harvard, then joined the University of Toronto. His work shifted from macroeconometrics to economic demography, focusing on how demographics affect the economy, especially with the aging baby boomers. He emphasizes that demographic changes have significant social and economic impacts, like crime, leisure, and school enrollment. His book \"Boom Bust & Echo\" became a bestseller and influenced policy debates.\n\nNow, the main topic is his contributions to economic demography. Key concepts include the impact of demographics on the economy, the aging population, and his influential book. I should mention his academic background, his shift in research focus, the main ideas from his work, and the significance of his book. Also, note his role in policy discussions. Need to keep it concise, avoiding specific examples unless they're crucial. Let me check the selected readings, but maybe they're not necessary for the summary unless they highlight his key works. The user wants 3-5 sentences, so I need to be concise. Make sure to include his argument about demographics explaining \"two-thirds of everything\" and the impact of his book. Avoid too much detail on the books' content. Alright, time to put it all together.\n</think>\n\nDavid K. Foot is a Canadian economist and demographer known for his work on the economic impacts of demographic shifts, particularly the aging of the baby boomer generation. His research highlights how population changes influence social and economic factors like crime, leisure, and education, arguing that demographics shape \"two-thirds of everything.\" He co-authored the influential 1996 book *Boom Bust & Echo*, which became a national bestseller and spurred policy debates in Canada. Foot's work emphasizes the need for policymakers to address demographic trends, such as aging populations and shifting age structures, to manage economic and social challenges effectively. His contributions span academic publications and public discourse, blending economic theory with practical policy insights.",
