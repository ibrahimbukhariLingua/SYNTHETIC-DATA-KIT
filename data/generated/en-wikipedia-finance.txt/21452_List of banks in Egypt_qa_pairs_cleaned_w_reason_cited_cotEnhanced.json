  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the list of banks in Egypt. Let me start by reading through the content carefully. The document provides a list of banks in Egypt as of 2024, categorized by their control (state-controlled or part of international groups). There are 37 banks listed, with some details on their ownership and groups. The user wants a 3-5 sentence summary focusing on the main topic and key concepts.\n\nFirst, the main topic is the list of banks in Egypt. The key concepts would include the number of banks, their types (state-controlled vs. international), the largest banks by assets, and some banks that have ceased operations. Also, there's a mention of banks under special legislation. \n\nI should note that the list is based on the Central Bank of Egypt's registration. The six largest banks are highlighted with their asset values. Then, there's a section on banks under special legislation and those that have stopped operating. \n\nI need to make sure the summary is concise. Start with the purpose of the document, mention the number of banks, the types (state vs. international), the largest ones, and the additional sections about special legislation and ceased operations. Avoid listing all the banks but highlight the key points. Check for any specific terms or groups mentioned, like the Central Bank of Egypt, and ensure the summary flows well without unnecessary details.\n</think>\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive list of banks in Egypt as of 2024, registered with the Central Bank of Egypt, including 37 institutions categorized by ownership (state-controlled, international groups, or branches). Key highlights include the six largest banks by total assets: National Bank of Egypt (NBE), Banque Misr, Commercial International Bank (CIB), QNB Al Ahli, Arab African International Bank (AAIB), and Banque du Caire. The list features both domestic state-owned banks and international subsidiaries, alongside sections on banks under special legislation and those that have ceased operations, reflecting Egypt's dynamic banking sector and mergers.",
