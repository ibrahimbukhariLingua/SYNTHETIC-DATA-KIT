  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Herzog, Fox & Ne'eman in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main points are that it's a full-service commercial law firm in Tel Aviv with over 470 lawyers, more than 200 partners. Founded in 1972 by three notable lawyers: Chaim Herzog, Michael Fox, and Dr. Ya'akov Ne'eman. Each had significant roles in Israeli politics and law. The firm joined Ius Laboris in 2012. Their areas of expertise include China and Asia Pacific, Japan, and Russia/CIS. \n\nWait, the areas of expertise section is cut off. The user might have only provided part of it. The original text mentions \"Specialist Practice Areas\" with China and Asia Pacific, Japan Practice, Russia and CIS practice. But maybe there are more areas? The user's input ends there. So I should note that the expertise includes those regions but maybe there's more. However, since the document is cut off, I can only mention what's provided.\n\nI need to focus on the main topic and key concepts. The main topic is the law firm's background, history, and areas of expertise. Key concepts include the founding partners, their backgrounds, the firm's size, and their international network. Also, the specific regions they specialize in.\n\nSo, the summary should mention the firm's establishment, founders, their notable roles, the firm's size, the Ius Laboris membership, and the areas of expertise. But since the areas are cut off, I should mention the ones listed and note that there are more areas if needed. However, the user might not want that. Let me check the original text again. The user's input ends with \"Russia and CIS practice\" under the \"Specialist Practice Areas\" section. So I should include those three regions as the main areas of expertise.\n\nPutting it all together: Start with the firm's name, location, size, and founding. Mention the founders and their roles. Note the Ius Laboris membership. Then list the areas of expertise. Keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Avoid any markdown. Make sure it's clear and covers all key points without extra details.\n</think>\n\nHerzog, Fox & Ne'eman (HFN) is a prominent Tel Aviv-based commercial law firm established in 1972 by three influential lawyers: Chaim Herzog (later Israel's president), Michael Fox (a corporate law pioneer), and Dr. Ya'akov Ne'eman (a tax law expert and former minister).
