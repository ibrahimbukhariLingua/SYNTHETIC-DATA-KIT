  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Dinç Bilgin in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document mentions that Dinç Bilgin is a Turkish businessman born in 1940. He founded Medya Holding, which includes newspapers like Sabah and Takvim, and TV stations like ATV. These were sold for $1.1 billion. He also started Ateş and Yeni Yüzyıl, which he sold later. \n\nIn his career, he started at Yeni Asır, then founded those media companies. There's info about Etibank's privatization in 1998 under Medya İpek Holding, co-owned with Cavit Çağlar. The bank was sold to his company in 2000, then taken over by TMSF. He was sentenced in 2011 for financial issues related to Etibank.\n\nThe main points are his media empire, the sale of companies, the Etibank privatization and subsequent issues, and his prison sentence. I need to condense this into a concise summary, making sure to highlight the key concepts: founding Medya Holding, the sale of media assets, the Etibank involvement, and the legal consequences. Avoid minor details like the exact dates unless they're crucial. Check for clarity and flow.\n</think>\n\nDinç Bilgin, a Turkish businessman born in 1940, founded Medya Holding, a media conglomerate that included newspapers like *Sabah* and *Takvim* and TV stations such as ATV, which were later sold for $1.1 billion. He also established *Ateş* and *Yeni Yüzyıl* in 1995, later selling them to Korkmaz Yiğit. Bilgin's career included involvement in banking, notably the 1998 privatization of Etibank under Medya İpek Holding, which he later sold before the government took over the bank in 2000. He faced legal consequences in 2011, receiving a five-year prison sentence for financial misconduct related to Etibank. His career highlights his influence in Turkish media and finance, alongside controversies surrounding corporate governance.",
