  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Beirut Stock Exchange in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document introduces the BSE as Lebanon's only stock exchange, located in Beirut. It mentions that it's a public institution managed by a committee, and that members are Lebanese joint-stock companies with a minimum capital. The BSE allows brokerage firms to trade listed securities and has a market value of 20.4 billion USD as of January 2024. \n\nThen there's a history section. It was established in 1920, started with gold and currency, then grew in the 1930s with French and local investments. It faced a decline during the Civil War from 1975-1983, then was restructured in 1994 with new systems. They partnered with Bourse de Paris, introduced automated trading, and added new securities types. In 2017, it was privatized into BSE SAL.\n\nThe hours are from 9:00 am to 12:30 pm, excluding weekends and holidays. The list section shows companies in different sectors like real estate, banking, trading, and manufacturing, with details on their shares and classes.\n\nSo the main points are: BSE's role as Lebanon's sole exchange, its structure and members, historical development including challenges and modernization, privatization in 2017, and current operations. I need to condense this into 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts. Avoid too many details but include the establishment, history, structure, privatization, and current market value. Also mention the sectors and types of companies listed. Make sure it's concise and covers all essential info without getting bogged down in specifics.\n</think>\n\nThe **Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE)** is Lebanon's sole stock exchange, established in 1920 and restructured after a 1983 hiatus due to the civil war, with modernization efforts including automated trading systems and partnerships like with the Bourse de Paris. It operates as a public institution managed by a committee, listing Lebanese joint-stock companies with a minimum capital of £L500,000, including banks, real estate firms, and industrial entities, and has a market value of $20.4 billion as of 2024. The BSE transitioned to a privatized joint-stock company (BSE SAL) in 2017, offering diverse securities like GDRs and preferred shares, while maintaining trading hours from 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM, excluding weekends and holidays.",
