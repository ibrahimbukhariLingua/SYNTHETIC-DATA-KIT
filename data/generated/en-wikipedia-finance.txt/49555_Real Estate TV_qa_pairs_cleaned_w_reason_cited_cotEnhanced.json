  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Real Estate TV in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main points seem to be that Real Estate TV (RETV) was a UK-based channel under News Corporation's Fox International Channels. It was the only dedicated property channel in the UK, combining traditional TV with online services. It launched in 2004, closed in 2009, and had a 24-hour broadcast on Sky. They had a +1 channel, reached millions, and had a website with streaming and property services. They also had various programs focusing on global property markets and won awards for broadband use. The on-air staff and programming list are mentioned, but maybe those are secondary details.\n\nI should focus on the main topic: RETV's role as a property TV channel, its services, reach, and achievements. Key concepts include being the UK's only property channel, multi-platform approach (TV and online), programming content, awards, and closure. I need to make sure the summary is concise, hits the main points, and avoids listing all the programs or staff. Let me check if I missed anything important. The part about advertising for property professionals is also a key point. Okay, I'll structure the summary to include the launch, services, reach, programming focus, awards, and closure.\n</think>\n\nReal Estate TV (RETV), a UK-based property-focused television channel under News Corporation's Fox International Channels, operated as the UK's only dedicated property channel from 2004 to 2009, blending traditional TV with online on-demand services. It offered 24/7 programming, including global property shows and original series like *Next Big Thing*, targeting property investors and buyers, while also providing digital tools like property finders and currency exchange services. RETV reached 21 million viewers in the UK and Ireland, won awards for broadband innovation, and served as an advertising platform for real estate professionals. Its closure marked the end of a pioneering multi-media approach to property content.",
