  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about IBAHN in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document says IBAHN is a global provider of digital info and entertainment systems for hospitality and meetings. They have 400 employees in 17 offices across North America, Asia, Europe. They serve over 3,000 hotels in 40+ countries. In 2014, they were bought by Guest-tek after Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nHistory: Founded in 1998 as STSN, an ISP for hotels. First client was Marriott in 1999. In 2002, Intel invested, which helped install WiFi in 400 Marriott hotels. Rebranded as iBahn in 2005, expanded services to include guest services, meetings, and moved beyond hotels to corporate and government clients. Current clients include big names like Bank of America, IBM, Marriott, etc. Investors include Siemens, Intel, Marriott, etc.\n\nProducts: They offer IP-based solutions and high-speed internet for hospitality and meetings.\n\nSo the main points are: company overview, history from STSN to iBahn, expansion of services and clients, key investors, and their product offerings. Need to condense this into 3-5 sentences, focusing on main topic and key concepts. Avoid too many details. Make sure to mention the rebranding, expansion, clients, and products. Also note the acquisition by Guest-tek in 2014. Check for any other key points like the number of employees, offices, and the bankruptcy.\n</think>\n\nIBAHN is a global provider of digital information and entertainment systems for the hospitality and meeting industries, serving over 3,000 hotels across 40+ countries with services like high-speed internet and IP-based solutions. Originally founded in 1998 as STSN, the company rebranded as iBahn in 2005, expanding its offerings to include guest services, conference solutions, and corporate/government clients, while securing investments from major firms like Intel and Marriott. Following a 2014 Chapter 11 bankruptcy, it was acquired by Guest-tek, marking a pivotal shift in its corporate structure and growth trajectory. Key clients include industry giants such as IBM, Marriott, and Boeing, alongside a network of 17 regional offices and 400 employees.",
