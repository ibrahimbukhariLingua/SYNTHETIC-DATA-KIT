  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Classical Monetary System of Uruguay. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document talks about the period from 1840 to 1855 when Uruguay minted its own coins. The main points seem to be the historical context, the challenges faced, the key events like the Great War, and the details of the coins minted. \n\nFirst, the introduction mentions that the coins were made in Montevideo, starting at Jouve's workshop and then the Casa de Moneda. The historical context includes economic problems, civil war, and the need for a national currency. The Great War (1839-1855) affected the minting efforts, with the Siege of Montevideo being a major event. \n\nThe first national coins were minted in 1839 by Jouve, then the Casa de Moneda took over. There were different stages of minting, with specific coins like the Peso del Sitio and Sol de Cabellera. The document also details the challenges like material shortages and the impact of the war on production. \n\nThe end of the classical period was marked by the closure of the Casa de Moneda in 1855, after which coins were minted abroad. The summary should highlight the key periods, the challenges, the significant coins, and the transition to foreign mints. I need to make sure to mention the historical context, the role of the Casa de Moneda, the impact of the war, and the notable coins. Also, the scarcity and historical value of the coins today. \n\nI should check if there are any other key points. The document also mentions the legal framework, laws passed, and the transition from foreign currencies to national ones. The economic difficulties and the efforts to establish a stable monetary system are important. \n\nSo, the summary needs to be concise, 3-5 sentences, covering the main topic (Uruguay's classical monetary system from 1840-1855), key concepts like the historical context, challenges, the role of the Casa de Moneda, notable coins, and the end of the period. Avoid too many details but include the essential elements.\n</think>\n\nThe **Classical Monetary System of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay** (1840–1855) emerged during a period of economic turmoil, civil war, and foreign currency dominance, aiming to establish a national currency. Coins were initially minted in Montevideo by Agustín Jouve and later by the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo*, facing challenges like material shortages and war disruptions. Key issues included the *Peso del Sitio* (a rare silver coin) and the *Sol de Cabellera*, alongside copper coins like the 5 and 20 centésimos, which symbolized national identity. The era ended in 1855 with the closure of the national mint, transitioning to foreign production, leaving behind scarce, historically significant numismatic pieces.",

[S2] These coins were minted entirely within the city of Montevideo, first at the \"*Taller y Armería Jouve*\" owned by a French artisan named Agustín Jouve and later at the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo* (Montevideo Mint) or *Casa de Moneda Nacional*, which was created for this purpose. [S3] This period in Uruguayan numismatics was immersed in a historical context full of economic problems, a non-existent currency, an economy practically in chaos and a civil war that lasted for years (the Great War). [S4] In spite of these difficulties, several attempts were made to mint a coin that would bear national signs and would be able to put an end to the prevailing chaos, given that up to that moment the currency of all the different regimes that had exercised power in the territory had been in circulation: the Crown of Spain, the Crown of Portugal, the British Empire, the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata and, finally, the Empire of Brazil. [S5] The first national coins were minted in 1839, in the workshop of the engraver Agustín Jouve, followed by the series minted in the *Casa de Moneda de Montevideo* until 1855, date from which the first coins were minted in foreign mints, thus culminating the classic period of Uruguayan numismatics. [S6] During this period magnificent coins were issued, among them the *Peso del Sitio* and the *Sol de cabellera*, all of which are currently museum pieces or are part of the most important collections in the country, each of them being highly coveted by collectors. [S7] ## Historical context\n\nSince the birth of the new Republic, on August 27, 1828, there were several attempts to create a monetary system that would solve the problem of the circulating currencies in the territory and define a national monetary system with national signs. [S8] However, the economic difficulties of the time and the social situation of the new State made it almost impossible to install an economic-monetary policy that would put an end to the daily difficulties of commerce. [S9] Once independence was achieved, the provisional government of General José Rondeau (October 4, 1828) did not take any monetary measure and allowed the circulation of all the currencies existing in the country at the date of assumption. [S10] The first decisions regarding the monetary aspect were taken in 1829, year in which it was prohibited the introduction of all copper coins coming from abroad into the territory of the Republic. [S11] However, precious metal coins (gold and silver) continued to circulate until 1893 (accepted until then for their intrinsic value), when their circulation was definitively prohibited. [S12] With the arrival of the first Constitutional President of the Republic, General Fructuoso Rivera, important measures continued to be taken, ordering in 1831 the withdrawal of all foreign copper currency. [S13] As a result of these measures, the city suffered a serious lack of foreign currency, so the government began to look for a quick solution to supply the needs of commerce. [S14] A solution to this situation was found by means of the law of March 14, 1831, which provided for the issuance of the currency known as \"Tenths of the city of Buenos Aires\" for half of its written value. [S15] These coins with a value of one tenth of a real were the first coins issued by the Oriental Republic of Uruguay.",

[S14] Immediately Agustín Jouve began the work but encountered many problems such as, for example, the shortage of copper and its high price in the market at the time. [S15] To solve the problem and start with the issue, the State agrees to a proposal from Jouve to indemnify him 32.5% over the costs agreed in the initial proposal.

[S17] These coins were quickly put into circulation by the government on October 15, 1840.

[S6] This law creates a new monetary system in which the *Peso* or *Patacón* is divided into 8 reales and each one of them into one hundred centésimos (a system that will last until 1862) and authorizes the issuance of coins of 5 and 20 centésimos (for an amount of $20,000). [S7] These coins will be the first to bear national signs. [S8] ### The Great War\n\nThe Great War was one of the events that had the greatest impact on the issues, in this context the first minting attempts of the classic period were developed and had a notable impact, limiting and in many cases canceling the issues. [S9] This conflict began in 1839 in Argentinean territory, and that confronted General Fructuoso Rivera and General Manuel Oribe, had moved since 1842 to the territory of the Republic. [S10] General Manuel Oribe burst into Uruguayan territory and reached the city of Montevideo, laying siege to the capital, which became known as the Siege of Montevideo. [S11] Once this siege was installed, two governments were declared; on the one hand, the so-called Defense Government, led by Rivera and installed in the city (until May 13, 1843, when Joaquín Suárez took over as president), and the Cerrito Government, led by Oribe, who claimed the presidency in Cerrito de la Victoria. [S12] ## First national minting\n\nAlthough the law authorizing this minting dates back to 1839, the first works to carry it out date from May 8, 1840, date on which the engraver Agustín Jouve presents a proposal to the Executive Power to carry out this activity. [S13] The Executive Power quickly accepted the engraver's proposal, since it was very convenient for the State, which took place on May 9 of that same year. [S14] Immediately Agustín Jouve began the work but encountered many problems such as, for example, the shortage of copper and its high price in the market at the time. [S15] To solve the problem and start with the issue, the State agrees to a proposal from Jouve to indemnify him 32.5% over the costs agreed in the initial proposal. [S16] In spite of this, only $500 were minted, which were delivered in two batches, one of $400 on October 3 and the other on October 7, 1840, in violation of the contract that established an amount of $20,000. [S17] These coins were quickly put into circulation by the government on October 15, 1840. [S18] This date was declared \"National Numismatic Day\" in 1990 by decision of the Executive Power to remember this important event in the history of Uruguay. [S19] These works were carried out in a small workshop owned by Jouve, which was called \"*Taller y Armería Jouve*\" and was located at 300 25 de Mayo Street.

[S12] On September 20, 1844, Andrés Lamas resigned from the Ministry of Finance due to a series of denunciations he received for irregularities committed in the *Casa de Monedas*. [S13] At the head of this ministry would now be Don Santiago Sayago who would order on October 20 the opening of the mint designating Don Juan de Bernade y Mederos as General Director. [S14] The existing stamps were immediately inspected and found to be in very poor condition, so the Director obtained authorization to have new ones engraved. [S15] During this period only 40 cent coins were issued with a date of 1844 (as was seen previously in issue 40 cent of 1844). [S16] This stage of the *Casa de Monedas* lasted until mid-January 1845, when it was definitively closed and the materials of Agustín Jouve used up to that time were returned. [S17] ### Second period of issues by the *Casa de Monedas*\n\nIn 1854 the National Mint was again established (but this time in the Government Fort) and Don Juan Gard was appointed as Director, with Don Agustín Rivero as engraver and Don Francisco Didión as assayer. [S18] On June 24, 1854, Laws No. [S19] 414 and 418 were enacted authorizing the minting of gold coins of 10, 20 and 40 reales together with coins of 5, 20 and 40 hundredths of copper.

[S15] During this period only 40 cent coins were issued with a date of 1844 (as was seen previously in issue 40 cent of 1844).
