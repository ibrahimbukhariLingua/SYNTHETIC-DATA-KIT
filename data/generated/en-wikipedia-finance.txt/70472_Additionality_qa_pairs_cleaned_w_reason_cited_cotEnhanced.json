  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document on additionality in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document defines additionality as an activity that adds something new, comparing it to a baseline. It mentions that additionality can be evaluated ex post or ex ante. Ex ante is for eligibility in markets like carbon credits. The baseline is the expected outcome without the intervention. \n\nThen there's the economic definition, which talks about the net positive difference from an intervention. The formula given is A = I_in - I_rc. The problems section discusses when additionality is problematic, like when the intervention doesn't actually change behavior, and the project would have happened anyway (business as usual).\n\nSo the main points are: definition, evaluation methods (ex post/ex ante), baseline concept, economic formula, and challenges with ensuring true additionality. I need to condense this into a concise summary, making sure to include the key concepts and main topic. Let me check if I missed anything. The example with carbon credits is mentioned, but maybe that's part of the application. Also, the issues with claiming additionality when the intervention isn't the real cause. Alright, time to put it all together clearly.\n</think>\n\nAdditionality refers to the concept of an activity producing a net positive impact by adding something new, measured against a baseline scenario without intervention. It is evaluated either ex post (after implementation) or ex ante (beforehand) to determine if an intervention, such as economic incentives, genuinely influences outcomes, distinguishing it from \"business as usual.\" The economic definition quantifies additionality as the difference between the intervention's impact and a reference case, accounting for factors like deadweight and leakage. Challenges arise when interventions fail to alter behavior, as projects may proceed regardless of the incentive, undermining their claimed additional value. This principle is critical in contexts like carbon credit markets, where verifying true additionality ensures environmental benefits are genuinely achieved.",
