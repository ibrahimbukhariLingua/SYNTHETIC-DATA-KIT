  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about William de Gelsey in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document introduces him as a British banker and economist of Hungarian origin, born in 1921 and died in 2021. He had a career in banking, working with companies like UniCredit and Orion Royal Bank. He was also a chairman at Richter Gedeon Nyrt. His family background is detailed, with noble Hungarian roots, and his family's history in banking and nobility. He did some charitable work, especially related to a school, and received honors like the Order of Merit of Hungary. The coat of arms is described, but maybe that's less important for the summary.\n\nThe main points are his profession, his family's background, his career in banking, his charitable efforts, and the honors he received. I should focus on the key concepts: his role as a banker, his family's nobility and history, his career moves, the school restoration, and the awards. Need to make sure it's concise, 3-5 sentences. Avoid too much detail on the family tree unless it's crucial. The summary should highlight his contributions and achievements.\n</think>\n\nWilliam de Gelsey was a British banker and economist of Hungarian origin, known for his leadership roles in international finance, including advising UniCredit and chairing Richter Gedeon Nyrt. Born into a noble Hungarian family with a legacy in banking and philanthropy, his career spanned investment banking, consulting, and corporate governance. He played a key role in restoring a historic Catholic high school in Hungary and received honors for his contributions to education and the Hungarian Catholic Church. His work bridged financial expertise with cultural preservation, reflecting his deep ties to Hungary despite his British affiliations.",

[S7] His paternal great-grandfather, Henrik Gutmann (1805–1890) of Gelse, was the president of the Nagykanizsa Savings Bank, founder and president of the Nagykanizsa Trade and Industry Bank shareholders' association, a citizen of Nagykanizsa, who was granted nobility and the noble predicate of Gelse from King Franz Joseph I of Hungary on 26 December 1869; his paternal great-grandmother was Nanette Strasser (1819–1878). [S8] His paternal grandfather, Baron Vilmos Gutmann of Gelse and Beliscse (1847–1921), a resident of Nagykanizsa, was appointed a royal councillor on 25 February 1882 and was subsequently granted the rank of Baron as well as the predicate of Beliscse on 16 September 1904.

[S7] His paternal great-grandfather, Henrik Gutmann (1805–1890) of Gelse, was the president of the Nagykanizsa Savings Bank, founder and president of the Nagykanizsa Trade and Industry Bank shareholders' association, a citizen of Nagykanizsa, who was granted nobility and the noble predicate of Gelse from King Franz Joseph I of Hungary on 26 December 1869; his paternal great-grandmother was Nanette Strasser (1819–1878). [S8] His paternal grandfather, Baron Vilmos Gutmann of Gelse and Beliscse (1847–1921), a resident of Nagykanizsa, was appointed a royal councillor on 25 February 1882 and was subsequently granted the rank of Baron as well as the predicate of Beliscse on 16 September 1904. [S9] In 1895, the generous Vilmos Gutmann of Gelse established the 'Vilmos Gutmann of Gelse Scholarship Foundation', which was intended for untiring students of exemplary conduct at the main grammar school of Nagykanizsa.
