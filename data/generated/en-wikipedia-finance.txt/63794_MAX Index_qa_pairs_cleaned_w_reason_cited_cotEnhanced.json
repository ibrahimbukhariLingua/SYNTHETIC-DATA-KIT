  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the MAX Index in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document introduces the MAX Index family as benchmarks for Hungary's domestic government bond market. It mentions the different indices: RMAX, MAX, MAX Composite, and ZMAX. Each has specific maturity ranges and rebalancing frequencies. The indices are calculated by the Hungarian Government Debt Management Agency Ltd. and follow EFFAS recommendations. The inception date is 1996, and they include local currency bonds and bills. \n\nI should highlight the main topic, which is the MAX Index family and their role as benchmarks. Then mention the key components: the different indices, their maturity ranges, rebalancing periods, and the agency responsible. Also, note the adherence to EFFAS guidelines and the inception date. Need to keep it concise, making sure each sentence covers a key point without getting too detailed. Let me check if I missed anything. The external sources are the agency and detailed descriptions, but maybe that's not necessary for the summary. Focus on the main elements: what the indices are, their structure, and the organization behind them. Avoid jargon where possible, but terms like \"total return bond index\" might be important. Alright, time to put it all together.\n</think>\n\nThe **MAX Index** family is a set of key benchmarks for Hungary's domestic government bond market, comprising the RMAX, MAX, MAX Composite, and ZMAX indices. These indices track fixed-rate government bonds and bills denominated in local currency, with varying maturity ranges and rebalancing frequencies (weekly, fortnightly, or monthly). Managed by the Hungarian Government Debt Management Agency Ltd., they follow EFFAS Bond Commission guidelines and have been in use since December 31, 1996. The MAX Composite Index combines RMAX and MAX, while each index targets specific segments of the bond market.",
