  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about LähiTapiola in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document introduces LähiTapiola as a Finnish finance group formed by merging Lähivakuutus and Tapiola. It serves various clients with insurance and financial services. The key points are the merger details, history, structure, and some recent developments.\n\nThe history section mentions the origins of both companies, their merger in 2012, and the challenges during the integration. The organisation part lists the different companies under the group and their regional presence. Ownership includes investments in other companies like Seligson & Co and Mehiläinen. There's also info on awards and literature.\n\nI need to focus on the main topic: LähiTapiola's formation, services, structure, and key milestones. Avoid minor details like specific years unless they're crucial. Make sure to mention the merger, the types of services, ownership, and maybe the strategic shifts like expanding into life support services. Keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Let me check if I missed anything important. The business results and market positions are mentioned, but maybe those can be condensed. Also, the cultural challenges during the merger are a key point. Alright, time to put it all together.\n</think>\n\nLähiTapiola is a Finnish financial services group formed in 2012 through the merger of Lähivakuutus and Tapiola, combining their insurance, banking, and investment services to serve private, corporate, and community clients. The company emphasizes customer ownership, offering damage, life, and retirement insurance, along with financial and wellness services, and has expanded into healthcare partnerships and investment management. Its structure includes regional subsidiaries, a centralized corporate culture, and strategic alliances like the S-Bank and Elo, while navigating historical challenges in merging distinct organizational identities.",

[S2] The Tapiola group was a centralised, professionally led company, where the CEO at the time Asmo Kalpala had a great deal of power. [S3] The corporate culture was described as polite and including academic discussion. [S4] On the other hand, Lähivakuutus had distributed management, where the power lay in independent insurance companies in the Finnish regions, acting in an agile and professional manner. [S5] The company led by Moisander employed a direct way of speaking. [S6] Throughout the years, there had been multiple attempts to fuse the two companies and both of them had futilely tried to merge with Fennia. [S7] The companies feared the business would turn to be led by banks, as their competitor the OP Group provided bonuses to its bank clients, which could be used in insurance payments. [S8] The fusion brought a competitive advantage in the growing competition. [S9] The birth of LähiTapiola was the responsibility of Kalpala, Moisander and the chairman of the board of Lähivakuutus, Ralf Wikström. [S10] In the negotiations, Lähivakuutus had a good position, as it did not need the fusion as much as the Tapiola Bank which had lost part of its market share. [S11] Kalpala himself was motivated by a need to go through the fusion before retiring. [S12] The board of Lähivakuutus wanted to retain the independence of its regional communities in the fusion. [S13] In practice the fusion was equal, but it was met with much resistance to change. [S14] LähiTapiola was one of the largest damage insurance providers in Finland and had a market share of 25.6%.¹⁵ LähiTapiola was also the fourth largest provider of life insurance in Finland with a market share of 7.9%.¹⁹\n\nIn June the Tapiola Bank changed its name to the LähiTapiola Bank. [S15] The Tapiola Bank and the S-Bank announced their fusion on 6 June 2013 as a part of a larger collaboration between the S Group and LähiTapiola. [S16] The S Group owned 75% of the new bank and LähiTapiola owned 25%. [S17] Moisander managed to form a common corporate culture by treating everyone equally and through interaction and discussions. [S18] The LähiTapiola staff learned the leadership manner of Lähivakuutus based on the balance and the profit calculation, which brought profitability and cost awareness to the company. [S19] On the other hand, Tapiola brought a great deal of new business: life insurance, banking, re-insurance and internationalisation. [S20] A culture of appreciation and understanding was formed by realising the strengths of both parties. [S21] In 2014 LähiTapiola started a new strategic initiative involving a diverse and conversing management. [S22] In early 2014 the LähiTapiola Central Retirement Insurance Company fused with Eläke-Fennia. [S23] The new work insurance company was named Elo. [S24] In May 2014 the S-Bank and LähiTapiola merged into a new S-Bank. [S25] ### LähiTapiola (2015-)\n\nIn 2016 LähiTapiola was the second largest damage insurance company with a revenue of 1.1 billion euro, of which the life insurance company had a share of 422 million euro. [S26] The company had 1.6 million owner customers. [S27] The total sum of client funds controlled by LähiTapiola was 9.7 billion euro, and its associates included the S-Bank, Elo and Pihlajalinna. [S28] LähiTapiola employed about 3400 people. [S29] In January 2017 LähiTapiola announced it would renew its strategy by diminishing its role as an insurance company and making life support into its core function.
