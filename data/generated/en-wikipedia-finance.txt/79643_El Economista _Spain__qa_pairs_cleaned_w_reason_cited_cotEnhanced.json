  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about El Economista in Spain. Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe main points seem to be about the newspaper's focus on economic, financial, and business topics. It's based in Madrid, started in 2006 as the fourth financial daily. The founders are mentioned, along with the publisher. The target audience is professionals and investors, emphasizing free competition, gender equality, and transparency. \n\nThey have a unique format: broadsheet, white paper, color printing, different sections with colors. Supplements on weekends and weekdays. They were the first Spanish financial daily online. Awards for design, like World's Best Designed Newspaper in 2006 and others. Circulation numbers from 2007 to 2012 show some fluctuations.\n\nI need to condense this into 3-5 sentences. Focus on main topic (the newspaper's role and features), key concepts like focus areas, design, awards, and circulation. Avoid minor details. Make sure to mention the founders, target audience, unique aspects like paper color and supplements, and the awards. Also note the circulation stats but maybe just the key numbers. Check for clarity and conciseness.\n</think>\n\n*El Economista* is a Spanish daily newspaper founded in 2006, specializing in economic, financial, and business news, targeting professionals and investors while advocating free competition, gender equality, and transparency. It distinguishes itself with a broadsheet format, white paper, color printing, and distinct section colors, alongside supplements like *El Especial* and weekday editions. Recognized for its design, it won the World's Best Designed Newspaper in 2006 and was named among the world's top ten in 2006–2007. Despite fluctuating circulation—26,155 copies in 2007, 23,000 in 2011, and 32,274 in 2012—it remains a notable digital pioneer in Spanish financial media.",
