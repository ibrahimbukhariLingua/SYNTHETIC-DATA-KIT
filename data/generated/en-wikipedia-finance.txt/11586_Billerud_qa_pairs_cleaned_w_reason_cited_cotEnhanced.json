  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Billerud in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document introduces Billerud AB as a Swedish pulp and paper company that merged with Korsnäs in 2012. They later acquired Verso in 2022, which led to the name change from BillerudKorsnäs to Billerud. The company has production facilities in Sweden, Finland, and the US, with around 5,900 employees. Their production units make various paper products, and they're structured into Europe and North America regions. Ownership is mainly held by AMF and Frapag. \n\nThe key points are the company's history, mergers, acquisitions, production locations, and ownership. I should mention the name change due to the Verso acquisition, the regions they operate in, their product lines, and the ownership structure. Need to keep it concise, making sure each sentence covers a main topic without too much detail. Let me check if I missed anything important. The history part is important for context, and the regions and segments are key for their structure. Also, the ownership percentages are a detail but maybe not necessary unless it's a key point. The summary should be clear and cover the main aspects without getting bogged down in numbers. Alright, time to put it all together.\n</think>\n\nBillerud AB is a Swedish pulp and paper company that rebranded from BillerudKorsnäs in 2022 after acquiring U.S. coated paper firm Verso Corporation, expanding its global presence. The company operates nine production facilities across Sweden, Finland, and the U.S., producing paper products like fluting, cartonboard, and graphic papers, with a focus on packaging and sustainable solutions. Structured into European and North American regions, Billerud generates 65% of its sales in Europe and 28% in North America, led by CEO Ivar Vatne since 2023. Major shareholders include AMF Pension & Funds (15.62%) and Frapag Beteiligungholding AG (12.06%), reflecting its strong institutional ownership.",
