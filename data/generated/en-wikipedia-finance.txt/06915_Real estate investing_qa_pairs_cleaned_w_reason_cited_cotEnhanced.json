  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document on real estate investing in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document begins by defining real estate investing as buying, managing, and selling real estate for profit. It mentions real estate entrepreneurs and contrasts it with real estate development. Then there's a history section about the 1980s and international investments, especially in China. \n\nNext, the overview covers types of investments (core, value-added, opportunistic), categories like residential, commercial, and industrial. Valuation is discussed, noting the uniqueness of properties and methods like CAP rate. Financing details include leverage, equity, and different loan types like hard money loans. \n\nSources of returns include net operating income, tax shelters, equity build-up, and capital appreciation. There's a section on foreclosure investments and the BRRR strategy. The impact section cites studies on institutional investors affecting housing markets, like in Ireland.\n\nI need to capture the main topics: definition, types, valuation, financing, return sources, strategies, and impact. Make sure to mention key concepts like leverage, CAP rate, BRRR, and the effects of institutional investment. Keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Avoid too many details but hit the essentials. Check for any specific terms or examples that are crucial, like the JOBS Act and crowdfunding. Also, note the difference between investment and speculation. Ensure the summary flows logically from the basics to the impact.\n</think>\n\nReal estate investing involves purchasing, managing, and selling properties for profit, categorized into core, value-added, and opportunistic strategies, with types including residential, commercial, and industrial properties. Key concepts include valuation methods like net operating income and capitalization rates, financing through leverage (debt) and equity, and return sources such as rental income, tax benefits, and capital appreciation. Strategies like buy-rehab-rent-refinance (BRRR) and foreclosure investments highlight diverse approaches, while challenges like market inefficiencies and information asymmetry underscore the complexity of real estate markets. The document also notes the impact of institutional investors on housing affordability and policy, as seen in cases like Ireland's rental market.",

[S2] Fundrise was the first company to crowdfund a real estate investment in the United States. [S3] ### Sources of investment returns\n\nReal estate properties may generate revenue through a number of means, including net operating income, tax shelter offsets, equity build-up, and capital appreciation. [S4] Net operating income is the sum of all profits from rents and other sources of ordinary income generated by a property, minus the sum of ongoing expenses, such as maintenance, utilities, fees, taxes, and other expenses. [S5] Rent is one of the main sources of revenue in commercial real estate investment. [S6] Tenants pay an agreed upon sum to landlords in exchange for the use of real property, and may also pay a portion of upkeep or operating expenses on the property. [S7] Tax shelter offsets occur in one of three ways: depreciation (which may sometimes be accelerated), tax credits, and carryover losses which reduce tax liability charged against income from other sources for a period of 27.5 years. [S8] Some tax shelter benefits can be transferable, depending on the laws governing tax liability in the jurisdiction where the property is located. [S9] These can be sold to others for a cash return or other benefits. [S10] Equity build-up is the increase in the investor's equity ratio as the portion of debt service payments devoted to principal accrue over time. [S11] Equity build-up counts as positive cash flow from the asset where the debt service payment is made out of income from the property, rather than from independent income sources. [S12] Capital appreciation is the increase in the market value of the asset over time, realized as a cash flow when the property is sold. [S13] Capital appreciation can be very unpredictable unless it is part of a development and improvement strategy. [S14] The purchase of a property for which the majority of the projected cash flows are expected from capital appreciation (prices going up) rather than other sources is considered speculation rather than investment.

[S17] A property is considered in pre-foreclosure when the homeowner has defaulted on their mortgage loan. [S18] Formal foreclosure processes vary by state and may be judicial or non-judicial, which affects the length of time the property is in the pre-foreclosure phase. [S19] Once the formal foreclosure processes are underway, these properties can be purchased at a public sale, usually called a foreclosure auction or sheriff's sale.

[S22] Once a property is sold at the foreclosure auction or as an REO, the lender may keep the proceeds to satisfy their mortgage and any legal costs that they incurred minus the costs of the sale and any outstanding tax obligations. [S23] The foreclosing bank or lending institution has the right to continue to honor tenant leases (if there are tenants in the property) during the REO phase but usually, the bank wants the property vacant to sell it more easily.

[S3] ### Sources of investment returns\n\nReal estate properties may generate revenue through a number of means, including net operating income, tax shelter offsets, equity build-up, and capital appreciation. [S4] Net operating income is the sum of all profits from rents and other sources of ordinary income generated by a property, minus the sum of ongoing expenses, such as maintenance, utilities, fees, taxes, and other expenses. [S5] Rent is one of the main sources of revenue in commercial real estate investment. [S6] Tenants pay an agreed upon sum to landlords in exchange for the use of real property, and may also pay a portion of upkeep or operating expenses on the property. [S7] Tax shelter offsets occur in one of three ways: depreciation (which may sometimes be accelerated), tax credits, and carryover losses which reduce tax liability charged against income from other sources for a period of 27.5 years. [S8] Some tax shelter benefits can be transferable, depending on the laws governing tax liability in the jurisdiction where the property is located. [S9] These can be sold to others for a cash return or other benefits. [S10] Equity build-up is the increase in the investor's equity ratio as the portion of debt service payments devoted to principal accrue over time. [S11] Equity build-up counts as positive cash flow from the asset where the debt service payment is made out of income from the property, rather than from independent income sources. [S12] Capital appreciation is the increase in the market value of the asset over time, realized as a cash flow when the property is sold. [S13] Capital appreciation can be very unpredictable unless it is part of a development and improvement strategy.

[S16] ## Foreclosure investment\n\nSome individuals and companies focus their investment strategy on purchasing properties that are in some stage of foreclosure. [S17] A property is considered in pre-foreclosure when the homeowner has defaulted on their mortgage loan. [S18] Formal foreclosure processes vary by state and may be judicial or non-judicial, which affects the length of time the property is in the pre-foreclosure phase. [S19] Once the formal foreclosure processes are underway, these properties can be purchased at a public sale, usually called a foreclosure auction or sheriff's sale. [S20] If the property does not sell at the public auction, then ownership of the property is returned to the lender. [S21] Properties at this phase are called Real Estate Owned, or REOs. [S22] Once a property is sold at the foreclosure auction or as an REO, the lender may keep the proceeds to satisfy their mortgage and any legal costs that they incurred minus the costs of the sale and any outstanding tax obligations. [S23] The foreclosing bank or lending institution has the right to continue to honor tenant leases (if there are tenants in the property) during the REO phase but usually, the bank wants the property vacant to sell it more easily.
