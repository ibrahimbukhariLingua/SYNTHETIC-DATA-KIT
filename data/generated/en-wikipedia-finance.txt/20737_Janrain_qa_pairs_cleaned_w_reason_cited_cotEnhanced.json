  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Janrain in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document introduces Janrain as a customer identity and access management (CIAM) software company based in Portland, founded in 2002. It mentions that Akamai acquired them in 2019. The history section talks about their founding, growth, funding rounds, and key milestones like partnerships and acquisitions. They developed products like RPX, Janrain Engage, and JUMP, which handle social logins, user data management, and single sign-on. Their technology helps clients personalize user experiences and manage online identities. They had notable clients like Fox News, Intel, and MTV. The company expanded internationally, had a unique office space, and even had a project called Jyte, which was later acquired and shut down. They received recognition in rankings like Inc. 5000 and Deloitte's Technology Fast 500.\n\nNow, I need to condense this. The main points are: Janrain's role as a CIAM provider, founding and acquisition, key products, growth through funding, clients, and some notable projects. I should mention their focus on identity management, OpenID, major clients, expansion, and the Jyte project. Also, the acquisition by Akamai. Need to keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Avoid too many details but hit the main topics. Let me check if I missed anything important. The technology section is crucial, as well as the funding and clients. Also, the office details might not be necessary. The Jyte part is a minor point but shows their innovation. Okay, time to draft the summary.\n</think>\n\nJanrain is a customer identity and access management (CIAM) software company based in Portland, Oregon, founded in 2002 and acquired by Akamai in 2019. It specializes in solutions like social login, user profile management, and single sign-on, enabling businesses to personalize user experiences and manage online identities through technologies such as OpenID. The company grew rapidly through venture capital funding, expanded internationally, and served major clients including Fox News, Intel, and MTV, while also developing innovative tools like Janrain Engage and Jyte, a now-defunct community platform. Its products emphasized data-driven insights and privacy compliance, earning recognition in industry rankings like the Inc. 5000 and Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500.",

[S2] It was established in 2002. [S3] Akamai acquired Janrain in January 2019. [S4] ## History\n\nJanrain was founded in Portland in 2002 by Larry Drebes, who as of 2016ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ is the company's chief technology officer (CTO), and former chief executive officer (CEO). [S5] The firm's name \"references a wet January in Portland\", and has been described as a \"leading provider of customer profile and identity management\". [S6] According to *Forbes*, Drebes recognized the value of social media in 2004 and predicted the need for users to manage their online identities. [S7] He helped create the OpenID protocol, which has been called a \"decentralized authentication method for the new Web\". [S8] Janrain was a founding member of the OpenID Foundation and has advocated for OpenID. [S9] As a privately held company, Janrain has grown steadily since its inception. [S10] In December 2009, Janrain raised US$3.25 million from American venture capital firms DFJ Frontier, RPM Ventures, and Anthem Venture Partners. [S11] According to TechCrunch, the firms invested in Janrain's ability to \"effectively mass market and sell authentication systems to website publishers based on OpenID and other online identity technologies\". [S12] *The Oregonian* and VentureBeat have reported that Janrain had 60 employees by mid-2011. [S13] In August 2011, the company announced a $15.5 million funding round led by Emergence Capital Partners, which was used for hiring staff and marketing. [S14] Emergence founder Brian Jacobs joined Janrain's board of directors. [S15] That month, the company had funding totaling $18.7 million from the four venture capital firms, as well as from Timothy C. [S16] Draper, and Drebes. [S17] Janrain's sales \"more than doubled\" in 2012, and the company expected a quicker sales growth rate for 2013. [S18] Janrain had 170 employees by January 2013. [S19] That month, the firm received $33 million in new investment, marking one of the largest venture capital rounds for an Internet company in Oregon. [S20] Funding was led by Millennium Technology Value Partners, with additional participation by DFJ Frontier and RPM Ventures, existing investors Emergence Capital and Anthem Venture Partners, plus Epic Ventures, Salesforce.com, and Split Rock Partners. [S21] Including the 2013 investment, which was more than twice the amount of any venture investment in Oregon in 2012, Janrain had raised $52–53 million, and was noted as one of the \"best-funded young technology\" businesses in the state. [S22] The company reportedly planned to use the money to employ salespeople and engineers, enhance its technology, add new features to its software, and enter markets outside the U.S. [S23] In February 2013, the Austin, Texas-based company Umbel announced its partnership with Janrain to combine the former company's \"real-time audience insights\" technology with the latter's \"User Management Platform, providing actionable intelligence from rich social data, in real-time\". [S24] In December 2014, Janrain acquired the startup company Arktan for an undisclosed amount. [S25] Janrain began offering data services developed by both companies, which had worked together for \"several years\" before the acquisition. [S26] According to *Advertising Age*, Janrain had grown to 160 employees; Drebes said there would be no executive changes for Arktan's five employees. [S27] *Inc.* reported that Janrain earned $14.3 million in revenue in 2014, had a three-year growth rate of 294%, and employed 135 people—44 more than the previous year. [S28] In 2015, the firm expanded its international reach by building a new data center in China. [S29] In September 2015, *Portland Business Journal* said Janrain employed \"around 120, most of them in Portland\", and had raised $52.8 million to date from investors. [S30] In December 2015, the company secured an additional $27 million in their Series D funding, led by HighBar Partners.",

[S3] Janrain User Management Platform (JUMP) provides a single, unified view of users across multiple online properties and social identities, and includes products for social login, profile data storage, registration, and single sign-on.\"\n\nJanrain's \"social login\" technology enables websites to offer registration with profiles from Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, and other social media sites. [S4] It uses profile data, such as a user's age, gender, interests, and location, allowing marketers to target advertising messages. [S5] According to *The Oregonian*'s Mike Rogoway, Janrain \"encourages its clients to minimize what they ask online visitors to share, at least initially, and to build trust\". [S6] Janrain hired technology attorney Lewis Barr to serve as vice president for \"legal and privacy matters\", and to inform clients about the appropriate and legal collection of digital information. [S7] In June 2014, the company launched \"Janrain User-Generated Content\" (\"Janrain UGC\"); according to *Adweek*, the service \"allows brands to give their fans the ability to interact, comment on, and chat about content on their sites ... [S8] [and] allowing them to easily discover friends’ activities on those sites\" and \"better create personalized brand experiences\". [S9] Features include comments, activity streams, live chat, social post curation, and redesigned social sharing. [S10] The firm's \"Social Profile Navigator\" provides users with an overview of the data they are sharing on social media sites. [S11] Arktan, which Janrain acquired in 2014, developed technology that analyzes Facebook data and enables comments, polls, reviews, and other services. [S12] Arktan had also developed social television technology and partnered with Facebook in India to generate on-air and online graphics using data from Facebook Keyword Insights API during the 2014 Indian Premier League cricket event. [S13] ### Jyte\n\n**Jyte** was a community-based website created by JanRain in late January 2007, named as an acronym for \"Just You Tell 'Em\". [S14] According to the developers, Jyte allowed users to \"make claims about [themselves], others, or just about anything\". [S15] These \"claims\" consisted of a headline and, optionally, a short text body. [S16] They could also be assigned user-selected tags. [S17] A claim was presented as a declarative sentence. [S18] Site users could then vote on it by selecting whether they agree or disagree. [S19] The total number of people who have voted, as well as their votes, were displayed with the claim. [S20] Users could also leave comments on claims, with or without voting.
