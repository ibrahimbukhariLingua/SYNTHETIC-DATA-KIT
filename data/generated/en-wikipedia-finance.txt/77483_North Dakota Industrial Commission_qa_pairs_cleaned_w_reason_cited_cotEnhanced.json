  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the North Dakota Industrial Commission in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main topic is the North Dakota Industrial Commission. The document explains that it's a body overseeing various state programs and resources. The key points are the members: Attorney General, Agriculture Commissioner, and Governor (as chair). Then there's a history section mentioning it was established in 1919 by the Nonpartisan League. \n\nNext, the areas of responsibility are listed. There are several agencies and programs under its oversight, like the Bank of North Dakota, Department of Mineral Resources, Housing Finance Agency, Lignite Research Program, Mill and Elevator, Oil and Gas Research Program, Pipeline Authority, and others. Each of these has specific roles, such as managing state-owned enterprises, regulating industries, providing financial assistance, and promoting energy research.\n\nI need to highlight the main topic, the structure (members), the history, and the key areas of responsibility. The user wants the summary to focus on main topics and key concepts, so I should avoid too many details but mention the major programs. Also, note that the Commission acts as various authorities, like the Building Authority and Pipeline Authority. \n\nI should check if there are any other key concepts. The Commission's role in overseeing state-owned enterprises and regulating industries like oil and gas, lignite, and housing. Also, the composition of the Commission and its historical background. \n\nNow, condense this into 3-5 sentences. Start with the purpose and members, then mention the history, then the key areas of responsibility, and maybe the impact on the state's economy. Make sure it's concise and covers all main points without getting bogged down in specifics.\n</think>\n\nThe **North Dakota Industrial Commission** is a state agency established in 1919 by the Nonpartisan League, comprising the Attorney General, Agriculture Commissioner, and Governor (as chair), tasked with overseeing key state-owned enterprises and programs.
