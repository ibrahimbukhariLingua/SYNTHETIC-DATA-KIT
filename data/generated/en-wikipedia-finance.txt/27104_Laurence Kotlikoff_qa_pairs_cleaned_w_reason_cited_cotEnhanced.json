Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document outlines Kotlikoff's background as an economist at Boston University, his areas of expertise, and his contributions. He's known for work in macroeconomics, public finance, and specific topics like generational accounting and the \"deficit delusion.\" His research includes the Auerbach-Kotlikoff model, which is a life-cycle model for economic analysis. He also developed generational accounting to assess fiscal burdens on future generations. \n\nHe's written many books and articles, and has been involved in policy proposals like the FairTax and Limited Purpose Banking. His political activities include running for president as an independent. The key points are his academic contributions, the generational accounting concept, his policy reforms, and his political endeavors.\n\nI need to make sure the summary includes his main areas of work, the generational accounting and deficit delusion concepts, his policy proposals, and his political runs. Also, mention his books and impact. Keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Avoid too many details but hit the main topics. Check for any other key elements like his critique of fiscal measures and the Auerbach-Kotlikoff model. Make sure it's clear and flows well.\n</think>\n\nLaurence Kotlikoff is a prominent American economist known for his work in macroeconomics, public finance, and fiscal policy, particularly his development of **generational accounting** to assess long-term fiscal burdens on future generations. He co-created the **Auerbach-Kotlikoff model**, a life-cycle economic framework, and critiqued conventional fiscal metrics like deficits, arguing they are linguistically arbitrary rather than economically meaningful. Kotlikoff advocates for radical policy reforms, including the **FairTax** and **Limited Purpose Banking**, and ran for U.S. president as an independent, emphasizing economics-based solutions to issues like Social Security, healthcare, and tax reform. His research spans topics such as intergenerational altruism, carbon taxation, and the \"deficit delusion,\" challenging traditional economic assumptions and promoting structural fiscal overhauls.",

[S6] ### Finance\n\nKotlikoff's proposed reform of the financial system, discussed in *Jimmy Stewart Is Dead*, called Limited Purpose Banking, transforms all financial companies with limited liability, including incorporated banks, insurance companies, financial exchanges, and hedge funds, into pass-through mutual funds, which do not borrow to invest in risky assets, but, instead, allows the public to directly choose what risks it wishes to bear by purchasing more or less risky mutual funds. [S7] According to Kotlikoff, Limited Purpose Banking keeps banks, insurance companies, hedge funds and other financial corporations from borrowing short and lending long, which leaves the public to pick up the pieces when things go south. [S8] Instead, Kotlikoff argues Limited Purpose Banking forces financial intermediaries to limit their activities to their sole legitimate purpose—financial inter-mediation. [S9] It would substitute the vast array of extant federal and state financial regulatory bodies with a single financial regulator called the Federal Financial Authority (FFA), which would have a narrow purpose namely to verify, disclose, and oversee the independent rating and custody off all securities purchased and sold by mutual funds. [S10] ### Healthcare\n\nIn his 2007 book, *The Healthcare Fix*, Kotlikoff proposed a major reform of the U.S. [S11] healthcare system, subsequently dubbed \"The Purple Health Plan\", that would do away with Medicare, Medicaid, employer-based healthcare, and health exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act. [S12] In their place, every American would receive a voucher for a basic health insurance policy, whose coverages would be established by a panel of doctors such that the total cost of all vouchers remained within a fixed share, e.g., 10 percent, of GDP. [S13] The voucher would be provided by the government at no cost and its amount would be individually risk-adjusted, i.e., sicker people would receive larger vouchers.

[S7] According to Kotlikoff, Limited Purpose Banking keeps banks, insurance companies, hedge funds and other financial corporations from borrowing short and lending long, which leaves the public to pick up the pieces when things go south. [S8] Instead, Kotlikoff argues Limited Purpose Banking forces financial intermediaries to limit their activities to their sole legitimate purpose—financial inter-mediation. [S9] It would substitute the vast array of extant federal and state financial regulatory bodies with a single financial regulator called the Federal Financial Authority (FFA), which would have a narrow purpose namely to verify, disclose, and oversee the independent rating and custody off all securities purchased and sold by mutual funds. [S10] ### Healthcare\n\nIn his 2007 book, *The Healthcare Fix*, Kotlikoff proposed a major reform of the U.S. [S11] healthcare system, subsequently dubbed \"The Purple Health Plan\", that would do away with Medicare, Medicaid, employer-based healthcare, and health exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act.
