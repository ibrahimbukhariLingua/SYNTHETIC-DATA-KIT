  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Portugal's electricity sector in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document starts with data from 2008, mentioning net electricity use, imports, and population. Then it moves to 2018 and 2019, showing the breakdown of electricity generation sources. There's a significant increase in renewable energy by 2023, reaching 61%, with targets for 85% by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2045. \n\nThe main power stations section talks about hydro, wind, and solar. The Frades pumped-storage plant is mentioned. Wind power capacity increased over the years, with specific numbers. There's a table showing Portugal's wind energy capacity compared to the EU. Solar power has a short payback time in Lisbon. Transmission is managed by REN, and there's a note about interconnection levels being below the recommended 10%.\n\nKey points to include: the growth in renewable energy, specific percentages for different sources over the years, the targets for 2030 and 2045, the role of wind and hydro, and the transmission infrastructure. I should avoid specific numbers unless they're crucial. Make sure to highlight the main trends and goals. Check for any other important details like the impact of weather on renewable percentages. Also, mention the interconnection level as a challenge. Keep it concise, 3-5 sentences.\n</think>\n\nPortugal's electricity sector has seen a significant shift toward renewable energy, with renewables accounting for 61% of electricity generation by 2023, up from 49% in 2022, driven by favorable weather and expanded wind and hydro capacity. The country aims to generate 85% of its electricity from renewables by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2045, ahead of earlier targets. Wind power has been a key contributor, with capacity growing from 3,357 MW in 2009 to over 4,500 MW by 2012, while hydroelectricity, including pumped-storage plants like Frades, remains critical. Despite progress, Portugal's electricity interconnection level (7% in 2014) lags behind the recommended 10%, highlighting challenges in cross-border energy trade. Solar energy also shows promise, with short payback times in regions like Lisbon.",
