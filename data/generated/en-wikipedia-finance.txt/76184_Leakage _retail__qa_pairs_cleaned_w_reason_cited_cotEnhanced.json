  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document on retail leakage in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document defines retail leakage as when local consumers spend more money outside their area, like going to neighboring towns or national chains. It mentions that this can happen due to unsatisfied demand or competition. Then there's a section on shrinkage, which is stock loss from theft or errors, not directly related to leakage. Revenue leakage is about losing money through discounts or fraud. Leakage analysis helps assess retail opportunities by comparing supply and demand. Digital commerce leakage is when online shopping leads to spending outside the local area, affecting local businesses.\n\nSo the main topics are retail leakage (causes, examples), shrinkage (different from leakage), revenue leakage, leakage analysis, and digital leakage. The key concepts are the different types of leakage, their causes, and the impact on local economies. I need to focus on the main topic, which is retail leakage, and include the key concepts like types (retail, shrinkage, revenue, digital), causes, and implications. Also, mention the analysis methods and the effect on local businesses. Avoid getting into too much detail on shrinkage and revenue leakage unless they're part of the main topic. Make sure the summary is concise, 3-5 sentences, covering the main points without the sub-sections.\n</think>\n\nRetail leakage occurs when local consumers spend more money outside their area, often due to unmet demand or competition from national chains, leading to economic outflows. It includes physical (e.g., shopping in neighboring towns) and digital forms (e.g., online purchases from global retailers), threatening local businesses' stability. The document also distinguishes related concepts like shrinkage (stock loss from theft) and revenue leakage (unintended discounts), while emphasizing leakage analysis as a tool to assess retail opportunities by comparing supply and demand. Key implications include the need for local strategies to attract businesses and mitigate losses, alongside recognizing that leakage isn't always a negative indicator of market potential.",

[S3] After all, retail leakage does not necessarily translate into opportunity. [S4] For instance, there could be tough competition in a nearby locality that leads the market for same type of product.

[S5] explicitly states that the factor measures the relationship between supply and demand and specifies the range as +100 (total leakage) to -100 (total surplus). This directly addresses the question, making [S5] the relevant citation. Other sentences like [S6] and [S7] describe interpretations of positive/negative values but do not mention the range, so they are not used here.",
