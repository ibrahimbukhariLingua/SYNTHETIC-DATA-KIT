  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Section 179 depreciation deduction in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document explains that Section 179 of the IRS code allows businesses to deduct the full cost of certain qualifying equipment as an expense instead of depreciating it over time. It mentions that this applies to tangible, depreciable personal property used in a trade or business. Before 2010, buildings weren't eligible, but now some real property might be. \n\nThen there's a part about MACRS depreciation for property not eligible under Section 179. The election is optional and must be made in the year the asset is placed in service. It's irrevocable unless permission is granted. \n\nNext, the limitations: there's a dollar limit ($1,040,000 for 2020), a phase-out if total purchases exceed $2,500,000, and a limit based on the taxpayer's business income. Any unused deduction can be carried over. \n\nThere's also a specific note about large vehicles, allowing up to $25,500 deduction for vehicles between 6,000 and 14,000 pounds, but not affecting larger commercial vehicles. \n\nSo the main points are: what Section 179 is, the types of property eligible, the limitations (dollar caps, phase-out, income limit), and the special case for large vehicles. I need to condense this into 3-5 sentences, making sure to include the key concepts without getting too detailed. Let me check if I missed anything. The summary should mention the purpose of Section 179, the eligibility, the limitations, and the vehicle specifics. Avoid mentioning MACRS unless necessary, but the document does say to see MACRS for regular deductions, so maybe include that briefly. Also, the election is optional and irrevocable. \n\nPutting it all together: Start with the main purpose, then the eligibility, the three limitations, and the vehicle exception. Keep it concise.\n</think>\n\nSection 179 of the U.S. tax code allows businesses to deduct the full cost of qualifying tangible, depreciable personal property (e.g., equipment, vehicles) as an expense in the year it is purchased, rather than depreciating it over time. Eligible property includes most business assets, with exceptions like buildings (now partially eligible) and specific vehicle weight categories. The deduction is subject to limitations: a maximum annual cap ($1.04 million for 2020), a phase-out if total purchases exceed $2.5 million, and a limit tied to the taxpayer’s business income. Additionally, large vehicles (6,000–14,000 pounds GVW) may qualify for a $25,500 deduction, while larger commercial vehicles are exempt from certain restrictions. Unused deductions can be carried forward to future years.",

[S2] § 179), allows a taxpayer to elect to deduct the cost of certain types of property on their income taxes as an expense, rather than requiring the cost of the property to be capitalized and depreciated. [S3] This property is generally limited to tangible, depreciable, personal property which is acquired by purchase for use in the active conduct of a trade or business. [S4] Buildings were not eligible for section 179 deductions prior to the passage of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010; however, qualified real property may be deducted now. [S5] Depreciable property that is not eligible for a section 179 deduction is still deductible over a number of years through MACRS depreciation according to sections 167 and 168. [S6] The 179 election is optional, and the eligible property may be depreciated according to sections 167 and 168 if preferable for tax reasons. [S7] Further, the 179 election may be made only for the year the equipment is placed in use and is waived if not taken for that year. [S8] However, if the election is made, it is irrevocable unless special permission is given. [S9] For regular depreciation deductions in the United States, see MACRS. [S10] ## Limitations\n\nThe section 179 election is subject to three important limitations. [S11] First, there is a dollar limitation. [S12] Under section 179(b)(1), the maximum deduction a taxpayer may take in a year is $1,040,000 for tax year 2020. [S13] Second, if a taxpayer places more than $2,000,000 worth of section 179 property into service during a single taxable year, the § 179 deduction is reduced, dollar for dollar, by the amount exceeding the $2,500,000 threshold, again as of January 1, 2018. [S14] Finally, section 179(b)(3) provides that a taxpayer's § 179 deduction for any taxable year may not exceed the taxpayer's aggregate income from the active conduct of trade or business by the taxpayer for that year. [S15] If, for example, the taxpayer's net trade or business income from active conduct of trade or business was $72,500 in 2006, then the taxpayer's § 179 deduction cannot exceed $72,500 for 2006. [S16] However, the § 179 deduction not allowed for any year because of this limitation can be carried over to the next year. [S17] ## Large vehicles\n\nUp to $25,500 of the cost of vehicles rated at more than 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight and not more than 14,000 pounds gross vehicle weight (like RV) can be deducted using a section 179 deduction.

[S14] Finally, section 179(b)(3) provides that a taxpayer's § 179 deduction for any taxable year may not exceed the taxpayer's aggregate income from the active conduct of trade or business by the taxpayer for that year. [S15] If, for example, the taxpayer's net trade or business income from active conduct of trade or business was $72,500 in 2006, then the taxpayer's § 179 deduction cannot exceed $72,500 for 2006. [S16] However, the § 179 deduction not allowed for any year because of this limitation can be carried over to the next year. [S17] ## Large vehicles\n\nUp to $25,500 of the cost of vehicles rated at more than 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight and not more than 14,000 pounds gross vehicle weight (like RV) can be deducted using a section 179 deduction.
