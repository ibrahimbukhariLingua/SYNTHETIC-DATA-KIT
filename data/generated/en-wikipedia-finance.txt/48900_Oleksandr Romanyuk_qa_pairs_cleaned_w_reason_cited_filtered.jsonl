The question is asking what position Oleksandr Romanyuk held from May 2020. I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the sentences in the context. Let's go through each one:\n\n[S1] Just mentions his name, nothing about positions.\n[S2] Talks about being appointed First Deputy Chairman in June 2015. But the question is about May 2020, so maybe not this one.\n[S3] Says \"Since May 2020 he was holding the position of director for Exploration and production division of NJSC Naftogaz of Ukraine.\" That seems directly relevant. So this is a possible answer.\n[S4] Mentions holding the position of acting general director since May 2022. That's after May 2020, so not relevant here.\n[S5] General experience, not specific position.\n[S6] Biography section starts here, but the following sentences talk about his education and career history.\n[S7]-[S14] These are about his education and previous jobs before 2015, so not relevant.\n[S15] Repeats the First Deputy Chairman appointment in June 2015.\n[S16] Talks about speaking at a forum in 2019, not the position.\n[S17] Says \"Since May 2020, he was the head of Exploration and Production Division of NJSC Naftogaz of Ukraine...\" This is another mention of the same position as [S3]. So both [S3] and [S17] mention the same role. Wait, but the question is about the position from May 2020. So the answer would be the director of the Exploration and Production division. But I need to check if there are other mentions.\n\nLooking further, [S17] is the same as [S3], maybe redundant. The user's context might have duplicates. But the answer is in both [S3] and [S17]. However, the question is about the position, so the answer is \"director for Exploration and production division of NJSC Naftogaz of Ukraine\" or \"head of Exploration and Production Division\". The exact wording matters. \n\nThe user's answer needs to cite the sentence numbers. So the correct citations would be [S3] and [S17]. But wait, in the supporting context, [S3] says \"director for Exploration and production division\" and [S17] says \"head of Exploration and Production Division\". Are these the same position? Probably, but the exact wording might differ. However, the question is asking for the position, so either would be correct. But since both sentences are present, I should include both citations.\n\nSo the answer would be that he held the position of director for Exploration and production division of NJSC Naftogaz of Ukraine from May 2020, citing [S3] and [S17]. But I need to check if the system requires all relevant citations. The user's example shows that if a sentence has multiple citations, they are listed. So in this case, the statement would be \"Oleksandr Romanyuk held the position of director for Exploration and production division of NJSC Naftogaz of Ukraine from May 2020.\" with citations [S3][S17]. \n\nWait, but looking at the original context, [S3] is \"Since May 2020 he was holding the position of director for Exploration and production division of NJSC Naftogaz of Ukraine.\" and [S17] is \"Since May 2020, he was the head of Exploration and Production Division of NJSC Naftogaz of Ukraine...\" So both sentences are referring to the same position, just using different titles (\"director\" vs \"head\"). But maybe they are the same role. Therefore, both sentences should be cited. \n\nSo the final answer would be a statement citing both [S3] and [S17]."}

Then in S13, it states that from 2001 to 2005, he was a Senior Consultant and Project Manager at McKinsey & Company. That seems to be the key part. \n\nFurther down, there's mention of his roles at other companies, but the specific role at McKinsey is in S13. The sentence says \"Senior Consultant, Project Manager of the international consulting company McKinsey & Company; from 2005 to 2009 was the investment projects manager...\" So his role there was Senior Consultant and Project Manager. \n\nI should check if there are any other citations related to McKinsey. Looking through the rest, S8 mentions he completed a Mini MBA at McKinsey Institute, but that's an educational program, not a role.

The citation for that sentence is [S23]. I need to make sure there's no other mention of the award elsewhere, but scanning through the rest of the text, I don't see any other references. The other sentences mention his positions and education, but not the award. So the correct citation is [S23]."}

[S16] Since May 2020, he was the head of Exploration and Production Division of NJSC Naftogaz of Ukraine, whose main tasks were to develop the hydrocarbons resource base and achieve energy independence of Ukraine. [S17] During the Ukrainian Energy Forum on July 14\u201316, 2021, the Division head`s announced Naftogaz has started research on the bottom relief in the Black Sea. [S18] In May 2022, he was appointed the acting general director of Ukrgasvydobuvannya JSC. [S19] He left the company in January 2023. [S20] During this time, because of the full-scale was, UkrGasVydobuvannya recorded a 3% production decrease rate, \u2013 one of the lowest decline rates in the industry, having produced 12.5\u00a0billion cubic meters of Ukrainian gas in 2022\n\nIn March 2023, in his interview to Liga.Business edition Olexandr Romanyuk said that UkrGasVydobuvannya secretly produced gas in the occupied territories.

[S22] ## Awards\n\nOn June 7th, 2018, Patriarch Filaret of Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kiev Patriarchate awarded him with the Order of St. [S23] Nicholas the Wonderworker to honor his efforts for the benefit of the Ukrainian state.", "question": "What was the primary goal of the Exploration and Production Division under Oleksandr Romanyuk?", "answer": "<statement>The primary goal of the Exploration and Production Division under Oleksandr Romanyuk was to develop the hydrocarbons resource base and achieve energy independence of Ukraine.<cite>[S17]</cite></statement>", "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the primary goal of the Exploration and Production Division under Oleksandr Romanyuk. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the sentences for mentions of the Exploration and Production Division. Looking at the chunk provided, there's a sentence [S16] that mentions Romanyuk speaking about UkrGasVydobuvannya's work on existing fields. But that might not be the specific goal. Then, looking further, [S17] states: \"Since May 2020, he was the head of Exploration and Production Division of NJSC Naftogaz of Ukraine, whose main tasks were to develop the hydrocarbons resource base and achieve energy independence of Ukraine.\" That seems directly relevant. \n\nAnother sentence [S18] mentions the division announcing research on the Black Sea's bottom relief, but that's more about a specific activity rather than the primary goal. The key part here is \"main tasks were to develop the hydrocarbons resource base and achieve energy independence.\" So the primary goal would be those two things. \n\nI need to check if there are other sentences that might add more context. [S16] talks about work on existing fields, but [S17] explicitly states the main tasks. Therefore, the answer should reference [S17]. There's also [S3] which mentions his position as director for Exploration and production division, but it doesn't specify the goals. So the main citation is [S17]. \n\nI should structure the answer with the statement about the primary goal and cite [S17]. Let me make sure there's no other sentence that contradicts or adds to this. The rest of the context talks about his career moves and other activities, but not the specific goals of the division. So the answer is based on [S17]."}
