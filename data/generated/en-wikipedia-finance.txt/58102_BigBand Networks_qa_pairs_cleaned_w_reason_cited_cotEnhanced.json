  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about BigBand Networks in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main points seem to be that BigBand was a company based in Redwood City, California, founded in 1999, specializing in multimedia tech for cable operators. They had an IPO in 2007 which led to a lawsuit over false financial statements. Then they were acquired by Arris Group in 2011. Their products included things like BMR and Cuda, and they won Emmy Awards. They had R&D centers in different locations and big clients like Comcast and Verizon.\n\nI should make sure to mention the key facts: founding year, location, IPO, lawsuit, acquisition, products, awards, and clients. Also, the R&D locations and the settlement amount. Need to keep it concise, avoiding too many details but hitting the main topics. Let me check if I missed anything important. The class-action lawsuit details, the settlement, and the acquisition terms. Also, the fact that they were acquired as a division within Arris. Okay, that should cover it. Now, structure it into 3-5 sentences without being too wordy.\n</think>\n\nBigBand Networks, a Redwood City-based company founded in 1999, specialized in digital video and data processing technologies for cable operators, offering products like the BMR platform and Cuda CMTS. It faced a 2007 IPO controversy involving a class-action lawsuit over alleged financial misstatements and channel stuffing, leading to a $1.5 million settlement in 2009. The company was acquired by Arris Group in 2011 for $172 million and later integrated into Arris, with its R&D centers in Israel, Massachusetts, and China. BigBand earned two Emmy Awards for its video-on-demand and switched video innovations, serving major clients like Comcast and Verizon.",

[S2] It had its IPO on the Nasdaq in 2007, which was met with controversy when a class-action lawsuit alleged that the company violated the Securities Act of 1933. [S3] The company was acquired as a division within Arris Group in 2011. [S4] BigBand manufactured and sold digital video and data processing products and services for digital video and cable modem termination systems (CMTS). [S5] During its existence, *BigBand* won two Emmy Awards for its video on demand service and switched video technology. [S6] ## Description\n\nBigBand's development centers were assimilated by Arris Group. [S7] The main video products are developed in Tel Aviv, Israel employing roughly 200 people. [S8] The main data and voice products development center is in Westborough, Massachusetts with roughly 175 people. [S9] A third research and development office is located in Shenzhen, China. [S10] The company formerly sold video, voice, and data products directly to major cable multi-system operators (MSOs). [S11] Amongst the company's biggest MSO clients were Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Cablevision, Cox with Verizon becoming their biggest customer in 2006. [S12] BigBand's main products include a digital video processing platform called BMR and a cable modem termination system (CMTS) called Cuda. [S13] The video platform enables services such as switched video, digital cable, video on demand and IPTV offered on a variety of transport networks such as QAM cable, DSL and Verizon Fios. [S14] BigBand won two Emmy Awards, one for service in the US with Time Warner Cable \"Start Over\", enabling video on demand, the ability to pause a broadcast program and watch it later.

[S16] ## History\n\n\n### 2007 IPO and class action lawsuit\n\nBigBand went public in March 2007. [S17] The offering was underwritten by Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Jeffries & Company, Cowen & Company and ThinkEquity. [S18] In October 2007, a class-action shareholder lawsuit was filed on behalf of shareholders who purchased BigBand Network securities in the company's IPO on March 15, 2007. [S19] The lawsuit sought to pursue remedies under the Securities Act of 1933. [S20] The complaint alleged BigBand violated the Securities Act, and that company insiders including the CEO, CFO and CTO knowingly published misleading and false statements about the company's financial health and product offerings. [S21] In particular, the complaint alleged that BigBand materially misstated their revenues, and engaged, among other allegations, in the practice informally known as channel stuffing to artificially inflate their financials prior to IPO. [S22] The suit was settled in 2009, with BigBand agreeing to pay US$1.5 million. [S23] In 2007, BigBand sued a firm started by ex-employees. [S24] The firm, called Imagine Communications, was allegedly infringing on 3 of BigBand's patents covering video processing and bandwidth management techniques.

      "reasoning": "The answer states that BigBand's switched video technology enabled 'delivering an unlimited number of broadcast channels to subscribers.' While sentence [S15] explicitly mentions this exact service (\"enabled cable operators to deliver unlimited number of broadcast channels\"), the cited sentence [S14] only lists 'switched video' as one of several services enabled by the video platform without specifying the 'unlimited broadcast channels' detail. Since [S14] does not directly support the exact claim in the answer, the citation is mismatched. However, [S15] would be the appropriate citation.
