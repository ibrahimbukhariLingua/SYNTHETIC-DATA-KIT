  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the U.S. House Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document begins by introducing the subcommittee, noting its previous name from 2019 to 2013 as the Subcommittee on Housing, Community Development and Insurance. Then there's a section on jurisdiction, explaining what they oversee, like HUD, Ginnie Mae, housing programs, and insurance. It mentions a shift in insurance jurisdiction from another committee in 2001 and a reorganization in the 112th Congress. \n\nNext, there are sections on members for the 119th Congress, with majority and minority lists, including chairs and ex-officio members. Then historical membership rosters for the 115th to 118th Congresses. \n\nThe main topic here is the structure, jurisdiction, and membership of the subcommittee. The key concepts would be its role in housing and insurance policies, jurisdiction changes over time, and the composition of its members across different Congresses. \n\nI need to condense this into 3-5 sentences. Focus on the subcommittee's purpose, jurisdiction, historical changes, and mention the membership details briefly. Avoid getting into too much detail about each Congress's members. Highlight the key points: oversight of HUD, Ginnie Mae, housing programs, insurance, jurisdiction shifts, and the current and past leadership. Make sure it's concise and covers the main aspects without listing all the names.\n</think>\n\nThe **U.S. House Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance** oversees policies related to housing, community development, and insurance programs, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Ginnie Mae, and initiatives like the National Flood Insurance Program. Its jurisdiction evolved over time, with insurance matters transferred from other committees and reorganized under this subcommittee following reforms to entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The subcommittee's membership, including chairs and ranking members, reflects partisan composition across different Congresses, with notable shifts in leadership and focus areas. Historical records highlight changes in jurisdiction and leadership, underscoring its role in shaping housing and insurance policies.",
