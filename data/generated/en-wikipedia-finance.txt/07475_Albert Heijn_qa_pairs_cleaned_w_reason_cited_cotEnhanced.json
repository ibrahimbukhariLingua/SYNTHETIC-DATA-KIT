  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Albert Heijn in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document begins by introducing Albert Heijn as the largest supermarket chain in the Netherlands with a 34.8% market share in 2020. It was founded in 1887 and is part of Ahold Delhaize since 2016. The history section mentions key events like the 1920s expansion, acquisitions, and the transition to self-service and supermarkets. There's also info on their formats like Albert Heijn, AH To Go, and AH XL, along with their sustainability efforts and online services. The Simon de Wit acquisition is highlighted, and the organization details include distribution centers and brand value.\n\nThe main topics are the company's history, growth through acquisitions, different store formats, sustainability initiatives, and market position. I need to condense this into a concise summary. Make sure to mention the founding year, market share, key historical milestones, formats, sustainability, and parent company. Avoid minor details like specific years of acquisitions unless they're crucial. Check for key concepts like self-service, online delivery, and brand value. Keep it to 3-5 sentences without being too verbose.\n</think>\n\nAlbert Heijn (AH), the largest Dutch supermarket chain with a 34.8% market share in 2020, was founded in 1887 and became part of Ahold Delhaize in 2016. The company expanded through strategic acquisitions, including Simon de Wit in 1973, and pioneered self-service stores and supermarkets in the 1950s. It operates multiple formats like AH To Go (convenience stores), AH XL (hypermarkets), and focuses on sustainability, organic products, and reducing food waste. Albert Heijn also ventured internationally, though some foreign ventures like Germany's AH To Go ended in 2018, while it maintains a presence in Belgium and Curaçao. Its brand value reached $866 million in 2014, reflecting its strong market position and innovation in retail formats.",

[S2] It was founded in 1887, and has been part of Ahold Delhaize since 2016. [S3] ## History\n\nThe chain was founded on 27 May 1887, when Albert Heijn bought a grocery store from his father Jan Heijn in Oostzaan. [S4] In the following years, Heijn opened other locations in several cities and in 1899, he opened a central warehouse in Zaandam. [S5] From 1895, Heijn started roasting his own brand of coffee in a laundry room in his Oostzaan location and in 1910, several other self-produced items were added, including confectionery, cakes and pastry. [S6] Until 1913, these products were produced in an old town house in Zaandam, but the company built a professional factory on this spot in 1913. [S7] In 1920, all enterprises were combined in the *Maatschappij tot Exploitatie der Fabrieken en Handelszaken* (Lit. [S8] \"Society for the Exploitation of Factories and Businesses\"). [S9] Anton Jurgens, one of the founders of Unilever, took a 50% share in the new company. [S10] These shares were bought back by the Heijn family in 1927. [S11] On 29 April 1920, Albert Heijn transferred control of the company to his sons Gerrit Heijn and Jan Heijn, and his son-in-law Johan Hille. [S12] Albert Heijn stayed on as president of the board. [S13] Albert Heijn Sr. [S14] benefited from the industrialization that brought prosperity through fixed wages for factory workers and a new group of rich people. [S15] Eating habits changed: less in quantity but more and other types of items. [S16] Due to the rise of manufacturers and prepackaged items, indigenous and exclusive products came within reach. [S17] The chain went public in 1948, and underwent two major changes in the 1950s. [S18] The first change was in 1952, with the introduction of their first self-service store and the second change was in 1955, with the opening of their first supermarket. [S19] The chain could become the largest within the Netherlands via several acquisitions. [S20] Notable (partial) acquisitions were Van Amerongen (1950), Simon de Wit (1972) and C1000 (2008 and parts in 2012). [S21] Ahold NV was founded on August 27, 1973 and Albert Heijn became part of it. [S22] The new construction made it easier for Albert Heijn's new parent company to enter the foreign market. [S23] In October of the same year, Etos was acquired, a number of stores were converted into Albert Heijn and the rest continued as a drugstore within Ahold. [S24] At the beginning of 2003, Albert Heijn saw its market share fall sharply: 22.8 percent against 24.7 percent a year earlier. [S25] In order to win back customers and leave the expensive image behind, Albert Heijn decided to start a large-scale price reduction in the same year. [S26] The chain permanently reduced the price of thousands of items every so often. [S27] At the end of 2006, managing director Dick Boer announced that Albert Heijn would stop lowering prices. [S28] The price difference with the competitors was successfully reduced by many percent. [S29] The market share was almost 30 percent at the end of 2006. [S30] In 2007, the company crossed the ocean with the opening of a franchise store in Curaçao. [S31] This shop remained open until 2016, when it was changed to a different brand. [S32] The company entered the Belgian market in 2011, with the opening of a store in Brasschaat. [S33] Despite the merger of Ahold and Delhaize, Albert Heijn and Delhaize both remained active in Belgium. [S34] Currently Albert Heijn has 60 stores. [S35] After Curaçao and Belgium the company entered the German market with their AH To Go formula. [S36] This venture ended in 2018. [S37] ### Simon de Wit",

[S4] In the following years, Heijn opened other locations in several cities and in 1899, he opened a central warehouse in Zaandam.

[S15] Eating habits changed: less in quantity but more and other types of items. [S16] Due to the rise of manufacturers and prepackaged items, indigenous and exclusive products came within reach. [S17] The chain went public in 1948, and underwent two major changes in the 1950s.

[S23] In October of the same year, Etos was acquired, a number of stores were converted into Albert Heijn and the rest continued as a drugstore within Ahold. [S24] At the beginning of 2003, Albert Heijn saw its market share fall sharply: 22.8 percent against 24.7 percent a year earlier. [S25] In order to win back customers and leave the expensive image behind, Albert Heijn decided to start a large-scale price reduction in the same year. [S26] The chain permanently reduced the price of thousands of items every so often. [S27] At the end of 2006, managing director Dick Boer announced that Albert Heijn would stop lowering prices. [S28] The price difference with the competitors was successfully reduced by many percent. [S29] The market share was almost 30 percent at the end of 2006. [S30] In 2007, the company crossed the ocean with the opening of a franchise store in Curaçao. [S31] This shop remained open until 2016, when it was changed to a different brand. [S32] The company entered the Belgian market in 2011, with the opening of a store in Brasschaat. [S33] Despite the merger of Ahold and Delhaize, Albert Heijn and Delhaize both remained active in Belgium. [S34] Currently Albert Heijn has 60 stores.

[S3] ### Simon de Wit\n\n**Simon de Wit** was a large family-owned chain of supermarkets in the Netherlands. [S4] The company was founded by Simon de Wit (1852–1934), who after his father's death in 1867 started a grocery store from his parental house in Wormerveer. [S5] In 1888 he opened the first branch in Amsterdam and by 1900 he ran stores at 30 different locations and owned a central warehouse in Zaandam. [S6] In 1954 the opening of the 150th store was celebrated. [S7] In 1970, when Simon de Wit's grandson Simon was in charge, a fire destroyed the central warehouse in Zaandam. [S8] Soon after, Albert Heijn, which also originated in the Zaanstreek, showed interest in a takeover and in 1973 Simon de Wit merged with Albert Heijn, with all employees retaining their jobs. [S9] All remaining shops took on the name of the latter. [S10] ## Format\n\n\n### Albert Heijn\n\nThis format is most used throughout the Netherlands and Belgium and is their regular store format. [S11] Since 2018, the company began to roll out the concept *Echt Vers (Really Fresh)* in which the stores would be remodelled to offer 10–15% more fresh produce. [S12] Albert Heijn also distinguishes itself by the steadily growing range of organic and ecological products, reducing the use of plastics and investing in sustainable construction and transport. [S13] The expansion of the sustainable range was brought under the umbrella brand \"Puur & Eerlijk\" in 2009, under the leadership of Dick Boer, with adjustments to stricter certification and change of packaging. [S14] The retail chain is also committed to reducing food waste. [S15] ### AH To Go\n\nIn 1999, the chain developed a new format for a convenience store on request of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen, the railway company would become a franchisee and opened the first store on Station Den Bosch. [S16] The format got its current name in 2001, and specialises in products that customers need on their commute. [S17] Since 2019, the company is testing a new version of the format without staff and cash registers. [S18] The customer scans their debit card and cameras register the customer and the items that are picked, after the customer leaves the right amount is deducted from their account. [S19] The new concept and technology was tested in a mobile unit that has been placed at the headquarters of Ahold Delhaize and Schiphol. [S20] ### AH XL\n\nSince 2002, the company operates several hypermarkets with a larger variety of products in both food and non-food. [S21] Within the store there are also several chefs preparing take-away. [S22] This kind of store usually occupies the whole floor. [S23] ### Albert Heijn Online\n\nThe company started testing delivery in 1999, with the Albert Heijn Thuisservice, which was renamed Albert.nl in 2001. [S24] Via this channel customers could purchase their groceries, but also products from sister-companies Etos and Gall & Gall.

[S4] The company was founded by Simon de Wit (1852–1934), who after his father's death in 1867 started a grocery store from his parental house in Wormerveer. [S5] In 1888 he opened the first branch in Amsterdam and by 1900 he ran stores at 30 different locations and owned a central warehouse in Zaandam. [S6] In 1954 the opening of the 150th store was celebrated. [S7] In 1970, when Simon de Wit's grandson Simon was in charge, a fire destroyed the central warehouse in Zaandam. [S8] Soon after, Albert Heijn, which also originated in the Zaanstreek, showed interest in a takeover and in 1973 Simon de Wit merged with Albert Heijn, with all employees retaining their jobs. [S9] All remaining shops took on the name of the latter. [S10] ## Format\n\n\n### Albert Heijn\n\nThis format is most used throughout the Netherlands and Belgium and is their regular store format. [S11] Since 2018, the company began to roll out the concept *Echt Vers (Really Fresh)* in which the stores would be remodelled to offer 10–15% more fresh produce. [S12] Albert Heijn also distinguishes itself by the steadily growing range of organic and ecological products, reducing the use of plastics and investing in sustainable construction and transport. [S13] The expansion of the sustainable range was brought under the umbrella brand \"Puur & Eerlijk\" in 2009, under the leadership of Dick Boer, with adjustments to stricter certification and change of packaging. [S14] The retail chain is also committed to reducing food waste. [S15] ### AH To Go\n\nIn 1999, the chain developed a new format for a convenience store on request of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen, the railway company would become a franchisee and opened the first store on Station Den Bosch. [S16] The format got its current name in 2001, and specialises in products that customers need on their commute. [S17] Since 2019, the company is testing a new version of the format without staff and cash registers. [S18] The customer scans their debit card and cameras register the customer and the items that are picked, after the customer leaves the right amount is deducted from their account. [S19] The new concept and technology was tested in a mobile unit that has been placed at the headquarters of Ahold Delhaize and Schiphol. [S20] ### AH XL\n\nSince 2002, the company operates several hypermarkets with a larger variety of products in both food and non-food. [S21] Within the store there are also several chefs preparing take-away. [S22] This kind of store usually occupies the whole floor. [S23] ### Albert Heijn Online\n\nThe company started testing delivery in 1999, with the Albert Heijn Thuisservice, which was renamed Albert.nl in 2001. [S24] Via this channel customers could purchase their groceries, but also products from sister-companies Etos and Gall & Gall.
