  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document begins by introducing SARB as the central bank of South Africa, established in 1921 after World War I. It mentions that it's the fourth central bank outside the UK and Europe, following the Fed, Bank of Japan, and Bank of Java. The history includes a committee in 1920 leading to its establishment. The first banknotes were issued in 1922. It's noted that unlike the Bank of England, SARB is privately owned.\n\nNext, the functions are listed: monetary policy, issuing currency, supervising finance, payment systems, managing reserves, acting as government banker, exchange controls, and lender of last resort. The organizational structure has a board with a governor, deputies, and directors. Ownership details: 2 million shares, 696 shareholders, with a dividend cap. The government plans to nationalize it. Subsidiary CODI started in 2024. The list of governors is provided, ending with Lesetja Kganyago.\n\nKey points to include: establishment, historical context, functions, ownership structure, recent developments like CODI and nationalization plans. Need to keep it concise, avoiding specific dates unless crucial. Make sure to mention the main functions and unique aspects like private ownership and the nationalization plan. Also, note the role of the board and the subsidiaries. Avoid listing all governors, just mention the current one if needed. Check for any other important details like the dividend structure and the number of shareholders. Ensure the summary flows logically, covering origin, functions, structure, ownership, and recent changes.\n</think>\n\nThe **South African Reserve Bank (SARB)**, established in 1921 as Africa's first central bank, was created to address post-World War I financial instability and is privately owned, distinguishing it from institutions like the Bank of England. It oversees monetary policy, currency issuance, financial sector supervision, and manages national payment systems, while also acting as the government’s banker and lender of last resort. The SARB has a unique ownership structure with 2 million shares held by 696 shareholders, though the government plans to nationalize it, and it operates subsidiaries like the Corporation for Deposit Insurance (CODI) since 2024. Its governance includes a board of directors led by Governor Lesetja Kganyago, reflecting a blend of public and private oversight.",
