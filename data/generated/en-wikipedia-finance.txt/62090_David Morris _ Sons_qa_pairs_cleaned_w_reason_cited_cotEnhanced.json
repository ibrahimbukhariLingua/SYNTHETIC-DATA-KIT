  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about David Morris & Sons in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main topic is the history of David Morris & Sons, a bank in Wales. It was established in the 18th century, started by David Morris, who took over a bank in 1791. The bank moved locations over time and survived the 1825 panic. It was eventually taken over by the National Provincial Bank in 1871. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group now holds their archives. There are no surviving bank notes. Other banks in the area are mentioned too.\n\nI should focus on the key points: establishment, history, survival through crises, takeover, and legacy. Need to mention the locations, the takeover date, and the successor. Also note the lack of surviving notes. Keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Avoid minor details like specific dates unless crucial. Make sure to highlight the main events and the connection to RBS Group.\n</think>\n\nDavid Morris & Sons was a Welsh bank established in the 18th century by David Morris, evolving from a merchant business into a prominent local bank in Carmarthenshire. It survived the 1825 financial panic, expanded its operations, and was eventually acquired by the National Provincial Bank of England in 1871. The bank's legacy is preserved as a constituent of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group, though no surviving bank notes from the institution are known. Other regional banks, such as the Carmarthen Furnace Bank, coexisted in the area during its history.",
