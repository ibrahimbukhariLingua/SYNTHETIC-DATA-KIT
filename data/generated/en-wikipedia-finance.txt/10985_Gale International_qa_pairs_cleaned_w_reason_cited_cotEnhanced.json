      "chunk": "[S1] Gale International\n\n\n# Gale International\n\n\n\n**Gale International** is a privately owned real estate development company based in New York City. [S2] With roots dating back to 1922, the company is active in North America and Asia, specializing in city-scale, commercial, mixed-use, and golf course developments. [S3] ## History\n\nIn 1922 Daniel Gale founded the Daniel Gale Agency, a residential real estate development and brokerage company based in Long Island, New York. [S4] Daniel Gale’s son, Kent Gale, expanded the firm to become one of the largest privately owned real estate brokerages in the U.S., known today as Daniel Gale Sotheby’s International Realty. [S5] Kent Gale’s son Stan Gale founded The Gale Company in 1985. [S6] By 1990, the company had amassed a $500 million portfolio of development properties. [S7] Working with partners such as JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and SL Green, The Gale Company diversified into investment, development, property management, leasing and global facilities management, culminating in a sale to Mack-Cali Realty in 2008 for $545 million. [S8] The transaction was then one of the largest sales of a privately owned company to a public REIT (real estate investment trust). [S9] ## U.S. [S10] Development\n\nNotable U.S. [S11] projects include the relocation of the U.S. [S12] headquarters of Sanofi-Aventis Group to Bridgewater, New Jersey, in a $250 million lease transaction. [S13] One Lincoln Street, a landmark 1.1M SF speculative office tower in Boston’s Financial District, was 100% leased to State Street Financial while under construction and subsequently sold in 2004 for $705 million, which was, at the time, the most valuable commercial real estate transaction in Boston's history. [S14] The Gale Company’s first golf course-centric master planned community was the Ibis Golf and Country Club in West Palm Beach, comprising 2,500 homes and three Nicklaus golf courses, completed in 1996. [S15] One of the company’s noteworthy mixed-use projects is the Green at Florham Park (New Jersey), a 270-acre joint venture with The Rockefeller Group that includes a new headquarters and training facility for the New York Jets professional football team, age-restricted housing, a luxury hotel and an office complex. [S16] Recent projects include the 21W20 residential condominium in New York City’s Flatiron District, and the Campus at Greenhill, a 300,000 SF Class A office complex located on 104 acres, in Wallingford, CT. [S17] In February 2022, Daniel Gale Sotheby's International Realty celebrated its centennial with a celebration at the UBS Arena in New York. [S18] ## International Development\n\nIn 2004 Stan Gale created Gale International to focus on international development. [S19] The company serves as the principal developer of Songdo International Business District (Songdo IBD), a 1500-acre (6 sq km) greenfield city-scale project located on the west coast of South Korea. [S20] In this endeavor, Gale partnered with leading urban development companies, such as Nicklaus Design, Kohn Pedersen Fox, Arup Engineering, Whitman Strategy Group, United Technologies, Cisco Systems, Parsons Brinckerhoff, among others. [S21] In 2009 Gale International served as the master plan developer for the 1,700-acre (7 sq km) Meixi Lake development project, located in Changsha, Hunan Province. [S22] The master plan was then executed by the Changsha Municipal Government and local authorities. [S23] ## Sustainability and Wellness\n\nTo achieve the mandate for Songdo set forth by the South Korean government, which called for a state-of-the-art urban development built to international standards, Gale applied the U.S. [S24] Green Building Council’s LEED certification system to the Songdo IBD project. [S25] Songdo IBD boasts over 20 million sq ft of LEED-certified space, including the nation’s first LEED-certified residential building (Central Park residential), LEED-certified school (Chadwick International), LEED-certified hotel (Sheraton Incheon), and Asia’s first LEED-certified convention center (Convensia).",

      "chunk": "[S1] Gale International\n\n\n# Gale International\n\n\n\n**Gale International** is a privately owned real estate development company based in New York City. [S2] With roots dating back to 1922, the company is active in North America and Asia, specializing in city-scale, commercial, mixed-use, and golf course developments. [S3] ## History\n\nIn 1922 Daniel Gale founded the Daniel Gale Agency, a residential real estate development and brokerage company based in Long Island, New York. [S4] Daniel Gale’s son, Kent Gale, expanded the firm to become one of the largest privately owned real estate brokerages in the U.S., known today as Daniel Gale Sotheby’s International Realty. [S5] Kent Gale’s son Stan Gale founded The Gale Company in 1985. [S6] By 1990, the company had amassed a $500 million portfolio of development properties. [S7] Working with partners such as JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and SL Green, The Gale Company diversified into investment, development, property management, leasing and global facilities management, culminating in a sale to Mack-Cali Realty in 2008 for $545 million. [S8] The transaction was then one of the largest sales of a privately owned company to a public REIT (real estate investment trust). [S9] ## U.S. [S10] Development\n\nNotable U.S. [S11] projects include the relocation of the U.S. [S12] headquarters of Sanofi-Aventis Group to Bridgewater, New Jersey, in a $250 million lease transaction. [S13] One Lincoln Street, a landmark 1.1M SF speculative office tower in Boston’s Financial District, was 100% leased to State Street Financial while under construction and subsequently sold in 2004 for $705 million, which was, at the time, the most valuable commercial real estate transaction in Boston's history. [S14] The Gale Company’s first golf course-centric master planned community was the Ibis Golf and Country Club in West Palm Beach, comprising 2,500 homes and three Nicklaus golf courses, completed in 1996. [S15] One of the company’s noteworthy mixed-use projects is the Green at Florham Park (New Jersey), a 270-acre joint venture with The Rockefeller Group that includes a new headquarters and training facility for the New York Jets professional football team, age-restricted housing, a luxury hotel and an office complex. [S16] Recent projects include the 21W20 residential condominium in New York City’s Flatiron District, and the Campus at Greenhill, a 300,000 SF Class A office complex located on 104 acres, in Wallingford, CT. [S17] In February 2022, Daniel Gale Sotheby's International Realty celebrated its centennial with a celebration at the UBS Arena in New York. [S18] ## International Development\n\nIn 2004 Stan Gale created Gale International to focus on international development. [S19] The company serves as the principal developer of Songdo International Business District (Songdo IBD), a 1500-acre (6 sq km) greenfield city-scale project located on the west coast of South Korea. [S20] In this endeavor, Gale partnered with leading urban development companies, such as Nicklaus Design, Kohn Pedersen Fox, Arup Engineering, Whitman Strategy Group, United Technologies, Cisco Systems, Parsons Brinckerhoff, among others. [S21] In 2009 Gale International served as the master plan developer for the 1,700-acre (7 sq km) Meixi Lake development project, located in Changsha, Hunan Province. [S22] The master plan was then executed by the Changsha Municipal Government and local authorities. [S23] ## Sustainability and Wellness\n\nTo achieve the mandate for Songdo set forth by the South Korean government, which called for a state-of-the-art urban development built to international standards, Gale applied the U.S. [S24] Green Building Council’s LEED certification system to the Songdo IBD project. [S25] Songdo IBD boasts over 20 million sq ft of LEED-certified space, including the nation’s first LEED-certified residential building (Central Park residential), LEED-certified school (Chadwick International), LEED-certified hotel (Sheraton Incheon), and Asia’s first LEED-certified convention center (Convensia).",
