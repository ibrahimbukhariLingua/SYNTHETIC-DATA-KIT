  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about pension liberation in the UK. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main topic is pension liberation, which is a scam where people are tricked into thinking they can access their pensions before 55. The background says that legally, you can only access pensions at 55, except in rare cases. Scammers use confusion with pension release to lure people, but the High Court ruled there's no loophole. \n\nThe document mentions that the \"liberated\" money goes into overseas funds, which are risky. There are heavy taxes and fees: 55% tax on the money, 20% fee, and another 55% tax on the fee. The example shows that the person ends up with very little. \n\nConsequences include financial ruin and even suicides. The Pensions Regulator took action, freezing assets and making arrests. Scammers use websites, cold calls, or texts. The FCA warns against cold calls and suggests only using FCA-registered companies.\n\nPension release is different; it's legal when you're 55 or older. You can take 25% tax-free, and the rest stays invested. There were changes in 2015 allowing more flexibility but with tax. The age limit remains 55.\n\nSo the key points are: pension liberation is a scam, illegal before 55, high costs, risks, consequences, and the difference from legal pension release. I need to condense this into 3-5 sentences, focusing on main topic and key concepts. Make sure to mention the scam, legal aspects, costs, consequences, and the difference from legitimate pension release.\n</think>\n\nPension liberation in the UK refers to illegal schemes that trick individuals into believing they can access their pensions before age 55, despite legal restrictions. Scammers exploit confusion with legitimate pension release, which allows withdrawals at 55 or older, and often route funds into unregulated overseas accounts, incurring heavy taxes (55%) and fees (up to 20%), leaving victims with minimal returns. The practice has led to severe financial harm, including bankruptcies and suicides, prompting regulatory actions like asset freezes and arrests. Unlike legal pension release, which permits tax-free withdrawals (25%) at 55, pension liberation is a high-risk scam with no legal loophole, emphasizing the importance of avoiding unregulated providers and verifying schemes through official channels like the FCA.",

[S11] The Financial Times reported the suicide a 40-year-old man who did not receive the £17,000 lump sum promised to him from a liberation scheme.

[S13] The Financial Conduct Authority warns against cold-calling scams and it is advised to only work with a company registered on the FCA's list of regulated companies. [S14] ## Differences with Pension Release\n\nPension release is when a person removes money from their pension once they are 55 or older. [S15] As of 2015 UK law allows up to 25% of a defined contribution pension to be released tax free from the age of 55. [S16] People can be tricked into a pension liberation scam if they are unaware that they cannot access their pension at a younger age. [S17] The remainder of the fund stays invested until the individual decides to start drawing an income from it. [S18] Between April 2014 and April 2015 funds not exceeding £30,000 can be taken in their entirety, but from April 2015, restrictions on how much money is removed from a pension fund will be lifted, and a marginal rate of tax will be applied to withdrawals.

[S2] ## Background\n\nExcept in rare circumstances, such as terminal illness, pensions can only be legally accessed from the age of 55, and most opportunities to do so earlier are scams. [S3] Scammers use confusion with pension release to convince the unsuspecting that there is a legal loophole that allows them to access the money, but the High Court ruled in May 2014 that no such loophole exists. [S4] \"Liberated\" money is typically placed into overseas funds, which are high risk with little to no regulation. [S5] Pension liberation carries large costs.

[S13] The Financial Conduct Authority warns against cold-calling scams and it is advised to only work with a company registered on the FCA's list of regulated companies. [S14] ## Differences with Pension Release\n\nPension release is when a person removes money from their pension once they are 55 or older. [S15] As of 2015 UK law allows up to 25% of a defined contribution pension to be released tax free from the age of 55. [S16] People can be tricked into a pension liberation scam if they are unaware that they cannot access their pension at a younger age. [S17] The remainder of the fund stays invested until the individual decides to start drawing an income from it. [S18] Between April 2014 and April 2015 funds not exceeding £30,000 can be taken in their entirety, but from April 2015, restrictions on how much money is removed from a pension fund will be lifted, and a marginal rate of tax will be applied to withdrawals.
