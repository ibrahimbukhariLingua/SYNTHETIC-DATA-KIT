  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about LG Pay in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main topic is LG Pay, a mobile payment service by LG Electronics. It allowed users to make contactless payments using NFC and also had WMC for magnetic stripe terminals. The service was discontinued in the US in 2021 and in South Korea by 2024. \n\nThe service was developed from Dynamics' IP, announced in 2015. It supported both NFC and WMC, which is important for compatibility. The app let users manage cards via swiping, and in South Korea, it was used for online, transportation, and ATM withdrawals.\n\nSecurity features included tokens for card info and authentication methods like OTP, fingerprint, and facial recognition. \n\nSo the key points are: what LG Pay was, its technology (NFC and WMC), its availability and discontinuation dates, and security measures. I need to condense this into a concise summary without extra details. Make sure to mention the main functions, the technologies used, the discontinuation, and security aspects. Avoid specific dates unless necessary, but the user mentioned focusing on main topics and key concepts. Maybe include the discontinuation dates as they are significant. Check for any other important elements like the South Korea usage. Alright, time to put it all together.\n</think>\n\nLG Pay was a mobile payment service by LG Electronics enabling contactless payments via NFC and wireless magnetic communication (WMC), allowing compatibility with both modern and older magnetic stripe terminals. Launched in 2015, it let users manage credit, debit, and loyalty cards on their phones, with features like swipe-based navigation and support for online, transportation, and ATM transactions in South Korea. The service prioritized NFC but used WMC to bridge compatibility gaps, while security relied on tokenized card data and multi-factor authentication (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition). LG Pay was discontinued in the U.S. in 2021 and will phase out in South Korea by mid-2024.",
