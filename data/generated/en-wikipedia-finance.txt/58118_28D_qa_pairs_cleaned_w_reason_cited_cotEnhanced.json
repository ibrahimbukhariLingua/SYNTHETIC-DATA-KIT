  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document in 3-5 sentences. Let me read through it again.\n\nThe main topic is \"28D,\" which refers to a press conference on December 28, 2017, by Argentina's Central Bank and Treasury. They changed their inflation target from 25% to 15% for 2018. This event led to a loss of confidence and the 2018 monetary crisis. The background mentions that inflation was 25% in 2017, and the Macri administration had just won elections. The change in targets was seen as a sign that the government was interfering with the Central Bank's independence, which caused distrust.\n\nSo the key points are: the event (28D), the inflation target change, the loss of confidence, the start of the crisis, and the perception of government interference. I need to make sure to include these elements concisely. Let me check if I missed anything. The user wants main topic and key concepts. Avoid extra details. Make sure it's 3-5 sentences. Let me try to structure that.\n</think>\n\nThe document discusses the \"28D\" event, a December 28, 2017, press conference by Argentina's Central Bank and Treasury that raised the 2018 inflation target from 25% to 15%, sparking a loss of public and market confidence. This shift was perceived as a political intervention undermining the Central Bank's independence, contributing to the 2018 monetary crisis. The context includes Argentina's 25% inflation rate in 2017 and the Macri administration's recent electoral success, with the target change viewed as a destabilizing signal.",
