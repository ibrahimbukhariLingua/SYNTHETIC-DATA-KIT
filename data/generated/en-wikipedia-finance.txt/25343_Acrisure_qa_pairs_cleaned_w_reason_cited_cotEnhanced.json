  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Acrisure in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main points seem to be that Acrisure is a financial tech and insurance company based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. They started by acquiring insurance companies in the Midwest and expanded nationally. They were ranked 6th largest insurance broker in 2022 by Business Insurance. \n\nLooking at the history section, they were founded in 2005 by Greg Williams and Ricky Norris. Genstar Capital bought them in 2013, and they did a lot of acquisitions, especially in 2014 and 2015. Then in 2016, management bought back the company. Blackstone funded them in 2018, and they became employee-owned. They started an AI platform called Altway after acquiring Tulco Labs in 2020. \n\nIn 2021, they acquired 155 firms, had $2.82B revenue, and 42.7% growth. They got naming rights for the Acrisure Arena in 2022. Then ADIA invested $725M in 2022, valuing them at $23B. They also got naming rights for Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh. In 2022, they bought two managed service providers. In 2023, they acquired Modus Underwriting in London and got naming rights for the Acrisure Amphitheater in Grand Rapids.\n\nSo the key concepts are their growth through acquisitions, expansion from Midwest to national, financial milestones like the $23B valuation, AI initiatives, and naming rights for venues. I need to highlight the main topic, which is Acrisure's growth and expansion through acquisitions, their financial success, and their ventures into tech like Altway. Also mention the major acquisitions and the naming rights as part of their brand presence. Make sure to keep it concise, 3-5 sentences, focusing on main points without too many dates or numbers.\n</think>\n\nAcrisure is a financial technology and insurance company based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, originally established to acquire Midwest insurance firms and later expanding nationally. Founded in 2005, it grew rapidly through strategic acquisitions, achieving $2.82 billion in revenue and 42.7% growth in 2021, while also developing an AI platform, Altway, and securing major naming rights for venues like the Acrisure Arena and Stadium. The company, valued at $23 billion after a $725 million investment from ADIA in 2022, continues to expand through acquisitions, including London-based Modus Underwriting Ltd. in 2023, solidifying its position as a leading global insurance broker.",
