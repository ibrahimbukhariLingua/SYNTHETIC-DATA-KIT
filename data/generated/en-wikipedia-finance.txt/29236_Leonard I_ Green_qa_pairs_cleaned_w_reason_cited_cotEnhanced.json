  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Leonard I. Green in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main topic is Leonard I. Green, an American businessman. The key points are his role as a founding partner of Leonard Green & Partners, his career in leveraged buyouts, the acquisition of Thrifty and Payless Drugs, and his philanthropy with the Los Angeles Opera. Also, his early education and personal life details are mentioned, but maybe those aren't as crucial for the summary.\n\nI should focus on his career achievements, the firms he founded, notable deals, and his philanthropy. The death date is important too. Let me check the structure: Early life, Career, Philanthropy, Personal life and death. The user wants the main topic and key concepts, so I need to highlight his business contributions and philanthropy. Avoid minor details like his marriages unless they're significant. The key concepts are leveraged buyouts, founding the firm, the Thrifty Payless acquisition, and his role in the opera. Also, mention the profit from the sale of Thrifty Payless. Make sure to keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Let me draft that.\n</think>\n\nLeonard I. Green (1934–2002) was a prominent American businessman and founder of the leveraged buyout firm Leonard Green & Partners, known for transformative acquisitions like Thrifty Drugs and Payless Drugs, which merged into Thrifty Payless, later sold for a $420 million profit. A pioneer in management-led leveraged buyouts, he co-founded Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen in 1969 before establishing his own firm in 1989. Beyond finance, Green was a key philanthropist, serving as a founding director of the Los Angeles Opera, where he donated $2 million and helped recruit Plácido Domingo. His career blended financial acumen with cultural contributions, leaving a legacy in both business and the arts.",
