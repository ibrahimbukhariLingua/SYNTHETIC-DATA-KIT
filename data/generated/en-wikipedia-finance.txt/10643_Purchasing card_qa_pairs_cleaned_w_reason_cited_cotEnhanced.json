  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about purchasing cards in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document introduces purchasing cards (PCards) as a company charge card alternative to traditional procurement processes. It mentions they're used in the UK as procurement cards and that employees have to follow policies, with controls like spending limits and merchant restrictions. Regular reviews by independent parties are important for managing the program.\n\nThe history section talks about their rise, especially in government, with examples like the DOD. They're used for low-value transactions to cut costs, and there's software to manage them. The A/P (accounts payable) use is growing, replacing checks and automating payments. The 2005 survey shows spending growth and predictions about adoption rates.\n\nStatistics include the increase from $80B to $110B in PCard spending, 43% of e-procurement still via check, and 70% of orgs expected to have a program by 2008. The document also mentions challenges like supplier resistance due to fees and surcharges, and the need for education and support during conversion.\n\nKey concepts: definition, controls, history, growth in A/P, statistics, issues with supplier enablement. I need to condense this into a concise summary. Make sure to mention the main purpose, how they work, their growth, benefits, and challenges. Avoid too many numbers but include the main stats. Highlight the shift to A/P and the issues with suppliers.\n</think>\n\nA **purchasing card (PCard)** is a company-issued charge card used to streamline procurement of low-value goods and services, bypassing traditional purchasing processes while allowing organizations to set controls like spending limits and merchant restrictions. Originally adopted to reduce costs and bureaucracy, PCard usage has grown significantly, with applications expanding into accounts payable (A/P) to replace checks and automate payments, driven by cost savings and efficiency. Despite growth, challenges like supplier resistance to card payments—due to fees and surcharges—require education and support to ensure successful implementation. Statistics show PCard spending rising from $80 billion in 2003 to $110 billion by 2005, with over 70% of organizations expected to adopt PCard programs by 2008, highlighting their strategic role in modern procurement.",

[S8] ## History\n\nUse of purchasing cards have seen a dramatic rise in recent years with many government organizations now using them to remove “red tape” and reduce costs. [S9] For example, In 2001 the Department of Defense (DOD) had 230,000 cardholders with an annual spend of $6.1 billion.
