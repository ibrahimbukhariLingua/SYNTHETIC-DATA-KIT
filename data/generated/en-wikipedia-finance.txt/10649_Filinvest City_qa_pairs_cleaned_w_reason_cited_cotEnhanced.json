  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Filinvest City in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main topic is Filinvest City, which is a central business district in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila. The history section mentions it started in 1995 by Filinvest, originally called Filinvest Corporate City. The Gotianuns acquired the site through a government bidding process. There was a rebranding to reflect a mixed-use development. The master plan was revised in 2017 with AECOM, leading to new areas like Spectrum Linear Park and the Northgate Cyberzone.\n\nManagement is handled by Filinvest Alabang, Inc., a subsidiary, with a 74% stake. Residential areas include Botanika, Vivant Flats, etc. The CBD is divided into six districts, with key spots like Festival Alabang and the River Park. It's accessible via Alabang-Zapote Road and has transportation options.\n\nSo the key points are: location, history of development and rebranding, management structure, residential areas, and the layout with key districts and facilities. I need to condense this into concise sentences, making sure to highlight the main aspects without getting too detailed. Also, check for any specific dates or names that are important. Avoid mentioning the Wanderland festival unless it's crucial, but since it's a key event, maybe include it. Ensure the summary flows logically, starting with the overview, then history, management, residential areas, and developments.\n</think>\n\nFilinvest City, formerly Filinvest Corporate City, is a central business district in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila, developed by Filinvest starting in 1995 on the site of a former government-owned farm. Originally a commercial hub, it evolved into a mixed-use area through a 2017 master plan revision by AECOM, introducing features like Spectrum Linear Park and the Northgate Cyberzone. Managed by Filinvest Alabang, Inc., it includes residential areas, key districts such as Festival Alabang and Civic Plaza, and hosts events like the Wanderland Music Festival, with accessibility via major roads and transit hubs.",

[S2] ## History\n\nThe development of Filinvest City began in 1995 by Filinvest at the site of the former Alabang Stock Farm. [S3] Under the administration of President Fidel V. [S4] Ramos, the farm was opened for joint development with the private sector and the government-owned property was placed for bidding. [S5] The Gotianuns acquired the farm after it bested the bids of companies of the Ayala and Gokongwei families in a government-organized bidding. [S6] The project was started by the Filinvest Development Corporation (FDC) through its founder Andrew L. [S7] Gotianun Sr. [S8] FDC established Filinvest Alabang, Inc. [S9] on August 25, 1993, to enter into a joint agreement with the government to develop the farm. [S10] The development was earlier known as the Filinvest Corporate City but was rebranded as Filinvest City to reflect a shift of the area as a mixed-use development from a primarily commercial venture. [S11] The master plan for Filinvest was revised in 2017 with the help of Singaporean firm AECOM. [S12] This led to the opening of the Spectrum Linear Park and the Northgate Cyberzone district cooling system by early 2018. [S13] ## Management\n\nFilinvest City is developed and managed by Filinvest Alabang, Inc. [S14] which is a subsidiary of Filinvest Development Corporation and Filinvest Land Inc.. [S15] Under the joint agreement with the government, the FAI owned 74 percent stake in Filinvest City.
