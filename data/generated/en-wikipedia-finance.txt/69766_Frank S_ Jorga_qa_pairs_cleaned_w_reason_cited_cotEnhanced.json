  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Frank S. Jorga in 3-5 sentences. Let me read through the content again to make sure I get the main points.\n\nFirst, the document starts by introducing Frank S. Jorga as a German businessman and investor who pioneered an online video identification system. He's the founder of WebID Solutions. That's the main topic. Then there's his education and career: he started an IT company with his brother, went into banking, studied business admin and law, got an MBA. Then he worked with the German-American Chamber of Commerce and consulted in Silicon Valley. After returning to Germany, he worked on the Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank merger liquidation. At GFKL, he launched online payment processes. In the 2010s, he wanted an alternative to Deutsche Post's PostIdent, leading to founding WebID Solutions in 2012. He got approval for video chat ID in 2014, developed more procedures. Expanded to Spain in 2023 as CEO, and Wiesbaden used their software for address changes.\n\nKey concepts: his role in developing online video ID, founding WebID Solutions, career transitions from IT to banking, legal studies, contributions to digital payment processes, expansion into Spain, and the impact of his technology in Germany.\n\nI need to condense this into 3-5 sentences. Start with his main achievement, mention his company, career path, key projects, and expansion. Also note the personal life briefly if needed, but the user said focus on main topic and key concepts. So maybe avoid personal life unless it's relevant. The summary should highlight his innovation in online identification, his company's development, and the impact of his work. Make sure to mention the transition from IT to banking, the development of the video ID system, the approval from the ministry, expansion into Spain, and the use in Wiesbaden. Keep it concise.\n</think>\n\nFrank S. Jorga is a German businessman and investor known for pioneering an online video identification system, which led to the founding of WebID Solutions in 2012. After transitioning from IT and banking roles, including work on Deutsche Bank's merger and digital payment processes, he developed a video chat-based identity verification method approved by the German government in 2014. WebID Solutions expanded its services to include online identity authentication and digital registration solutions, with applications like Wiesbaden’s address change system. Jorga later became CEO of WebID Spain in 2023, reflecting the company’s international growth. His career highlights a focus on digital innovation and streamlining financial and administrative processes through technology.",
