It was founded in 2003 and has over 110 million customers. The company is part of CK Hutchison Holdings, with different subsidiaries in various regions. There's info on their services, like 3G, 4G, 5G, and some past networks like in Australia. They also have international operations in countries like Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, UK, and Indonesia. The document mentions mergers, partnerships, and specific services like 3 Like Home roaming. \n\nThe main points are the company's structure, global presence, services offered, key markets, and some historical changes. I need to condense this into a concise summary. Make sure to mention the parent company, the regions they operate in, their services (3G, 4G, 5G), and maybe the merger with Vodafone UK. Also, note the customer base and any significant events like the Australia merger. Avoid too many details on specific countries unless they're crucial. Check for key concepts like the brand's origin, ownership structure, and major services or partnerships.\n</think>\n\nHutchison 3G Enterprises S.A.R.L., trading as 3 (Three), is a global mobile network operator under CK Hutchison Holdings, operating in Hong Kong, Macau, Austria, Denmark, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, and the UK, among others.

[S13] In May 2012, 3 Sweden launched its first LTE services. [S14] The network uses the TDD2600, FDD2600, FDD2100 and FDD800 bands. [S15] The network was launched with ZTE and according to ZTE, this is the world's first LTE network to use both FDD and TDD at the same time. [S16] Later it was switched to Huawei and Ericsson and as of now in July 2022 with the roll out of 5G the whole network is changed to Ericsson and Nokia Networks, due to the ban of using Huawei to build a 5G-network. [S17] At the beginning of 2022, 3 Sweden was Sweden's fastest growing mobile operator. [S18] 3 Sweden also operates its own lower-cost flanker brand Hallon, launched in 2013. [S19] 3 Denmark and 3 Sweden has \"3 Like Home\" which makes it possible to use the phone as home in 50+ countries like (Austria, Cyprus, USA, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Ireland, UK, Spain, Portugal, Malta, Puerto Rico, Greece, San Marino, Singapore, Switzerland, Netherlands, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Germany).

[S21] Service was initially offered as post-paid only, but on 16 May 2006 the introduction of a pre-paid service, known as 3Pay, was announced. [S22] Three operates 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G services. [S23] Until 2015, Three had a roaming agreement with Vodafone to provide 2G coverage where its original 3G network was unavailable. [S24] On 24 June 2013, it was announced that CK Hutchison Holdings would acquire Telefónica's Irish mobile operations, O2, for €780 million, to be merged into Three Ireland upon completion of the deal. [S25] The European Commission approved the merger in 2014. [S26] The O2 brand was phased out and its operations fully merged into Three on 2 March 2015. [S27] On 27 January 2014, Three launched its 4G network in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Wexford and Waterford. [S28] By March 2014, Three had expanded its 4G coverage to a further 11 towns. [S29] In 2016, Three started rolling out 4G+ claiming peak speeds of 225 Mbit/s. [S30] 4G coverage currently sits at 97.3% as of March 2020. [S31] On 28 September 2020, Three launched its 5G network, claiming 35% population coverage on day one.

[S12] Hutchison formerly operated an Australian CDMA network under the Orange brand name, as Orange One. [S13] It allowed customers to use their 3-branded CDMA mobile phone as a home phone when at home. [S14] Calls made from their mobile were charged at rates similar to those of a landline. [S15] Customers also received a \"Local Zone \" number allowing them to be called on a Landline number whilst at home. [S16] Should the phone be out of the Local zone, Calls made to the landline number either diverted to the Mobile number at a small fee, or was directed to Voicemail on the mobile handset.

[S18] The Orange One network was not as vast as others, and so Orange made arrangements with Telstra to allow the services of Orange One devices to roam to the Telstra network. [S19] On 1 February 2006, it was rebranded as 3 CDMA, and this network was closed as of 9 August 2006.

[S22] Besides that, 3 UK and also 3 Ireland initially made the decision to block direct Internet access from handsets, while 3 Austria allowed access to the Internet since the beginning.
