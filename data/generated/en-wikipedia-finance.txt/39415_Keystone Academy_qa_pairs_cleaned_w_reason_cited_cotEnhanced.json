  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Keystone Academy in 3-5 sentences. Let me read through the content again to make sure I get the main points.\n\nThe school is a private K-12 institution in Beijing, founded in 2014 by Malcolm McKenzie. It's also known as Beijing City Dingshi School. They offer the IB Middle Year Program for grades 6-10 and the IB Diploma Program for 11-12. The curriculum is similar to Sidwell Friends School. There's mention of an investor, Beijing Meilian Wenhua Investment Co., Ltd. The fees are quite high, over 200,000 RMB annually, which is four times the average Beijinger's disposable income in 2015. \n\nAccreditations include IB programs, Round Square, WASC, and others. The key concepts here are the school's establishment, curriculum, funding, tuition costs, and accreditations. I should focus on the main topic, which is Keystone Academy's profile, its educational programs, financial aspects, and accreditations. Need to make sure each sentence covers a distinct point without getting too detailed. Let me check if I missed anything. The name in Chinese is mentioned, so that's important. Also, the founder and the investor. The Xinhua News Agency's report on tuition is a key detail. The accreditations list is long, but maybe just mention the main ones like IB, Round Square, WASC. Alright, time to put it all together concisely.\n</think>\n\nKeystone Academy, established in 2014 in Beijing, is a private K–12 school offering the IB Middle Year Program (Grades 6–10) and IB Diploma Program (Grades 11–12), with a curriculum modeled after Sidwell Friends School.

The school is accredited by the IB, Round Square, Western Association of Schools and Colleges, and other international education organizations, emphasizing global academic and extracurricular standards.",
