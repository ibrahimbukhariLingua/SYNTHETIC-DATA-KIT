  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Ashkan Nikeghbali in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document mentions he's a French mathematician of Iranian descent, a professor at the University of Zurich, and his academic background. His PhD was from Pierre and Marie Curie University in 2005, supervised by Marc Yor. He's worked at various institutions like the Isaac Newton Institute, American Institute of Mathematics, and ETH Zurich. His research areas are financial mathematics, probability theory, and analytic number theory. He's involved in concepts like Mod-Ф convergence and stochastic zeta functions. He's also supervised PhD students and has advisory roles in companies like Roche and swissQuant. Awards include an honorary doctorate from Romania.\n\nSo the main points are his academic positions, research areas, key contributions, and other activities. I need to condense this into a concise summary. Make sure to mention his current position, his research focus, the concepts he introduced, and his other roles. Avoid minor details like the exact dates unless necessary. Check for any key terms that are essential, like Mod-Ф convergence and stochastic zeta function. Also, note his Iranian descent and French nationality. Keep it to 3-5 sentences without citations.\n</think>\n\nAshkan Nikeghbali is a French mathematician of Iranian descent and a professor of Financial Mathematics at the University of Zurich. His research spans financial mathematics, probability theory, and analytic number theory, with notable contributions such as the development of \"Mod-Ф convergence\" in asymptotic probability and the \"stochastic zeta function\" in number theory. He has held academic positions at institutions like ETH Zurich and the American Institute of Mathematics, supervised multiple PhD students, and engaged in advisory roles for organizations like Roche and swissQuant. His work bridges stochastic processes with applications in combinatorics, number theory, and financial modeling.",
