  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Ocean Group plc in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main topic is Ocean Group plc, a British transport company. The key points are its history, founding by the Holt brothers, the Blue Funnel Line, its listing on the London Stock Exchange, mergers and acquisitions, and the eventual merger with NFC plc to form Exel plc. \n\nThe history section mentions the company's origins as the Ocean Steamship Company, the Blue Funnel Line, and partnerships like with Swire Group. Then there's the 1969 formation of Overseas Containers Limited, which was later exited in 1986. The name changes over time, from Ocean Steam Ship Company to Ocean Transport & Trading, then Ocean Group. The 2000 merger with NFC plc is a significant event.\n\nThe group members section talks about the 1967 restructuring into four companies, and subsidiaries like Seaway Car Transporters, Guinea Gulf Line, and Palm Line. These subsidiaries were acquired by Elder Dempster and others.\n\nI need to focus on the main topic and key concepts. So, the summary should include the company's founding, its evolution through mergers and name changes, key subsidiaries, and the final merger. I should avoid too many details about specific subsidiaries unless they're crucial. Also, mention the FTSE 250 index and the London Stock Exchange listing. Make sure it's concise, 3-5 sentences.\n</think>\n\nOcean Group plc was a prominent British transport company, originally established as the Ocean Steamship Company in the 19th century and known for its Blue Funnel Line steamship services. It evolved through strategic mergers, including the 1969 formation of Overseas Containers Limited, and underwent name changes, becoming Ocean Group in 1990 before merging with NFC plc in 2000 to form Exel plc. The company diversified through subsidiaries like Elder Dempster and acquired lines such as the Palm Line, while restructuring its operations in the 1960s. Listed on the London Stock Exchange and part of the FTSE 250 Index, it played a significant role in maritime and logistics sectors.",
