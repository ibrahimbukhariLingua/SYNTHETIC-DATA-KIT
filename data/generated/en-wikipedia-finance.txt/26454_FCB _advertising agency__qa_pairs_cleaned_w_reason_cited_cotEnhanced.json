  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about FCB (Foote, Cone & Belding) in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document begins by introducing FCB as a major global advertising agency owned by Interpublic Group. It mentions the merger with Draft Worldwide in 2006 to form Draftfcb, and the rebranding back to FCB in 2014. The parent company, Interpublic, is one of the big four agency holding companies. \n\nNext, the history section talks about FCB's founding in 1873 as Lord & Thomas, Albert Lasker's role in revolutionizing advertising, and key campaigns like the \"Drink an orange\" ads. The agency expanded over the years, with major clients and international growth. There's a timeline of mergers, rebranding, and key figures like Susan Credle joining as Global Chief Creative Officer in 2016.\n\nThe campaigns and awards section lists various accolades from Cannes, The One Show, and other competitions. Specific campaigns like the 2010 U.S. Census, OREO's \"Daily Twist,\" and FCB Inferno's \"This Girl Can\" are highlighted. There's also mention of the Bully Hunters campaign in 2018, which faced backlash and sponsor withdrawals.\n\nThe key concepts here are FCB's history, its evolution through mergers and rebranding, its major campaigns and awards, and the controversy around the Bully Hunters campaign. The main topic is the agency's background, achievements, and notable projects. I need to condense this into a concise summary, making sure to include the parent company, key historical points, major campaigns, awards, and the Bully Hunters incident. I should avoid minor details and focus on the most significant information.\n</think>\n\nFoote, Cone & Belding (FCB), a global advertising agency owned by Interpublic Group, traces its origins to 1873 as Lord & Thomas and has evolved through key figures like Albert Lasker, who revolutionized modern advertising. Merging with Draft Worldwide in 2006 to form Draftfcb and later rebranding as FCB in 2014, the agency expanded internationally, securing major clients and numerous awards, including Cannes Lions and Effies, for campaigns like OREO's \"Daily Twist\" and Sport England's \"This Girl Can.\" Despite its success, FCB faced controversy in 2018 with the Bully Hunters campaign, which drew backlash and sponsor withdrawals over perceived misrepresentation. The agency remains a significant player in the advertising industry, recognized for creativity and innovation across global markets.",

[S13] The livestream itself consisted of pre-recorded footage of faked harassment as acted out by associates of FCB Media.

[S17] A CyberPowerPC representative stated \"What they told us was completely [different?] than the way they executed it\" and that they felt misled.
