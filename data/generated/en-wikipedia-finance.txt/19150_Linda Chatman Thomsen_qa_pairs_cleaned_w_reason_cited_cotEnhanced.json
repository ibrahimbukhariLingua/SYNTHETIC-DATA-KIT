  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Linda Chatman Thomsen in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document begins with her background: she was the first woman director of the SEC's Enforcement Division from 2005 to 2009. She worked under four chairmen and was involved in cases like Enron and Martha Stewart. But she didn't investigate Madoff, which led to criticism. Then there's her career history, education, and roles before the SEC. \n\nThere's a section about the Pequot Capital Management case where she faced scrutiny for the investigation's impartiality. Then the Madoff fraud hearings where she and others were criticized for not acting on tips. She resigned in 2009, and later there was another incident where she shared inside info with her former boss. She went back to Davis Polk after leaving the SEC.\n\nKey points to include: her role at SEC, the Madoff case and criticism, the Pequot investigation issues, her resignation, and her return to Davis Polk. Need to make sure the summary is concise, hits the main topics, and includes the key events without too much detail. Avoid minor points like her marriage. Check for the main concepts: her position, controversies, resignation, and current role.\n</think>\n\nLinda Chatman Thomsen was the first woman to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Division of Enforcement (2005–2009), overseeing high-profile cases like Enron and Martha Stewart but facing criticism for failing to investigate Bernard Madoff's fraud. She resigned in 2009 amid congressional scrutiny over the SEC's inaction on Madoff and controversies surrounding her handling of the Pequot Capital Management insider trading case. Thomsen later returned to the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, where she advises clients on regulatory matters, and faced additional scrutiny for sharing inside information with a former boss. Her career highlights tensions between regulatory enforcement, political pressures, and ethical boundaries in financial oversight.",
