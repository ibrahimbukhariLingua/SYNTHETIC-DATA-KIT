  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Nicholas C. Yannelis in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document introduces Yannelis as a professor at the University of Iowa and mentions his previous positions. His research areas include equilibrium concepts in games and economies with asymmetric information, infinite dimensional commodity spaces, discontinuous preferences, and equilibrium theory under ambiguity. He also did work in pure mathematics.\n\nIn the biography section, it talks about his education at Athens University of Economics, London School of Economics, and University of Rochester, where he got his Ph.D. under Lionel McKenzie. He's an editor for several journals and founded a society in 1991.\n\nHis research section details his early work on infinite dimensional general equilibrium theory and Aumann-Shapley value. He contributed mathematical theorems and focused on asymmetric information, introducing concepts like private core and differential information. He also worked on discontinuous preferences and ambiguity aversion, showing that efficiency and incentive compatibility can coexist with maximin expected utilities.\n\nSo the main points are his academic positions, his research areas (especially equilibrium theory with asymmetric info, discontinuous preferences, ambiguity), key contributions like the private core and Aumann-Shapley values, and his mathematical contributions. I need to condense this into 3-5 sentences, highlighting the main topic and key concepts. Make sure to mention his roles, research focus, and significant contributions without getting too detailed.\n</think>\n\nNicholas C. Yannelis is a distinguished economist and mathematician known for his pioneering research in general equilibrium theory, particularly in areas involving asymmetric information, discontinuous preferences, and ambiguity. His work includes developing key concepts like the private core, differential information models, and analyzing equilibrium in infinite-dimensional spaces, alongside contributions to mathematical tools such as selection theorems and fixed-point theory. Yannelis has also explored the interplay between efficiency and incentive compatibility under ambiguity, challenging traditional Bayesian frameworks. A prolific academic, he has held prominent professorships, edited leading economic journals, and co-founded the Society for the Advancement of Economic Theory. His interdisciplinary approach bridges economics and mathematics, significantly advancing theoretical foundations in game theory and decision-making under uncertainty.",
