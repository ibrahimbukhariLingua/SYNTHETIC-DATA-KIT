  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Ukraine. Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe main points are that the party was founded in 2000, led by Anatoliy Kinakh, who was a Prime Minister. They were part of different alliances in various elections. In 2002, they were in the For United Ukraine bloc and got 6 seats. In 2006, with Our Ukraine, they didn't win any seats. Then in 2007, they joined the Party of Regions, and in 2010 local elections, they had some representation. They didn't participate in 2012 and 2014 elections. The election results table shows their performance over the years.\n\nI need to make sure the summary includes the founding year, key leader, participation in elections, alliances, and their electoral success. Also, note their absence in later elections. Keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Avoid minor details like specific years unless crucial. Highlight the main topic: the party's history, alliances, and election results.\n</think>\n\nThe **Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Ukraine** (founded in 2000) is a political party led by former Prime Minister Anatoliy Kinakh, historically aligned with major alliances like *For United Ukraine* and *Our Ukraine*. It achieved limited electoral success, securing 6 seats in the 2002 parliamentary elections as part of the *For United Ukraine* bloc but failing to win representation in subsequent elections, including 2006 and 2007. The party later joined the *Party of Regions* in 2007 and had minimal local representation in 2010, eventually withdrawing from national elections in 2012 and 2014. Its influence waned over time, reflecting broader shifts in Ukraine's political landscape.",
