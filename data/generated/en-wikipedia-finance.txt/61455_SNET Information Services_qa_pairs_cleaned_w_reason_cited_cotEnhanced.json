  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document in 3-5 sentences. Let me read through it again to make sure I get the main points.\n\nThe document is about SNET Information Services, which was part of Southern New England Telecommunications. It's now owned by YP Holdings and publishes directories under YP Real Yellow Pages. The history section mentions acquisitions and rebranding: SBC bought SNET in 1998, then it became SBC Yellow Pages, then AT&T Yellow Pages after SBC bought AT&T. Then after BellSouth was bought by AT&T, they became AT&T Advertising & Publishing. In 2012, they reincorporated as YP Connecticut Information Services LLC and were sold to YP Holdings. In 2014, AT&T sold SNET to Frontier, but YP still uses the AT&T name for directories, while Frontier uses Local Insight.\n\nSo the main topics are the company's history, ownership changes, rebranding, and current status. Key concepts: ownership by YP Holdings, rebranding due to acquisitions, and the current publication under AT&T name despite being sold to Frontier.\n\nI need to condense this into 3-5 sentences. Start with the company's original name and current owner. Mention the history of acquisitions and rebranding. Note the 2014 sale and current directory publishing arrangement. Make sure to include the key points without getting too detailed.\n</think>\n\nSNET Information Services, originally part of Southern New England Telecommunications, was rebranded multiple times due to corporate acquisitions, including transitions to SBC Yellow Pages, AT&T Yellow Pages, and AT&T Advertising & Publishing. In 2012, it became YP Connecticut Information Services LLC under YP Holdings, while maintaining the AT&T brand for directories despite being sold to Frontier Communications in 2014. The company continues to publish directories for SNET customers through Local Insight Yellow Pages, retaining the AT&T name and logo.",
