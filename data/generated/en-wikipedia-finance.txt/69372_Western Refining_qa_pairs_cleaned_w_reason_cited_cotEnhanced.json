  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Western Refining in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document introduces Western Refining as a major oil refiner based in Texas, part of the Fortune 200 and Global 2000. It mentions their refineries in El Paso, Gallup, and St. Paul Park, with a combined capacity of 242,500 barrels per day. They produce light products like gasoline and diesel, and have a wholesale division serving multiple regions. \n\nThen there's the acquisition history: they were bought by Tesoro in 2017, renamed Andeavor, and later acquired by Marathon Petroleum in 2018. The history section talks about their origins, expansions, and key acquisitions like Giant Industries and the St. Paul Park refinery. \n\nCurrent capacity details include the El Paso refinery's expansion plans and the closed Bloomfield refinery. They sold some assets to Plains All American. Terminals and retail operations are spread across several states, with over 260 convenience stores. The logistics subsidiary, WNRL, was formed to handle pipelines and storage, with a stock offering in 2013.\n\nSo the main points are: company overview (location, refineries, capacity), acquisitions and ownership changes, key operations (retail, logistics), and recent developments. I need to condense this into concise sentences without getting too detailed. Make sure to mention the key acquisitions, the transition to Marathon Petroleum, the logistics arm, and their market reach.\n</think>\n\nWestern Refining, Inc. is a major U.S. crude oil refiner and marketer based in El Paso, Texas, operating refineries in El Paso, Gallup, New Mexico, and St. Paul Park, Minnesota, with a combined capacity of 242,500 barrels per day, producing light products like gasoline and diesel.

[S2] Western Refining (WNR) has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since January 2006 and is the fourth largest publicly traded independent refiner and marketer in the nation. [S3] The company is headquartered in El Paso, Texas; its refineries are located in El Paso, Gallup, New Mexico, and St. [S4] Paul Park, Minnesota. [S5] These refineries have a combined crude oil processing capacity of approximately 242,500 barrels per day (38,550 m³/d). [S6] A majority of products produced at these refineries are light products, consisting of gasoline, diesel fuel, and jet fuel. [S7] All three refineries have truck loading terminals. [S8] The El Paso refinery delivers to a number of other markets via pipeline. [S9] Western Refining owns and operates a wholesale division that works in conjunction with the refining operations. [S10] Through the refineries and these affiliated companies, Western Refining serves a broad customer base in Arizona, California, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, western Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, northern Chihuahua, Mexico, and the central East Coast region. [S11] In late 2016, it was announced that the San Antonio, Texas based refining and logistics company Tesoro, renamed to Andeavor, would purchase Western Refining for an estimated enterprise value of $6.4 Billion. [S12] Stockholders from both companies approved the proposed deal on March 24, 2017, pending approval from the Federal Trade Commission. [S13] In 2017, Western Refining was acquired by Tesoro (another independent petroleum Refining and marketing corporation) and the combined company changed its name to Andeavor. [S14] Western is currently a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum, after Marathon's acquisition of Andeavor in 2018. [S15] ## History\n\nThe El Paso refinery was originally two refineries across from each other on Trowbridge Avenue, one operated by Texaco, the other, larger, by Chevron Oil. [S16] In 1997 the company Refinery Holding was formed to manage the refineries; it purchased them outright in 2000. [S17] Western Refining purchased a pipeline system from Chevron capable of delivering 115,000 barrels of crude oil per day. [S18] In 2006 it became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. [S19] On August 28, 2006, Western Refining bought Giant Industries (GI) for $1.23 billion in cash, creating the fourth-largest publicly traded independent oil refiner in the USA. [S20] The combined company created the capacity to handle about 216,000 barrels a day from four refineries, about 84% more than Western's current capacity at the time. [S21] On November 12, 2013, Western acquired ACON Investments and TPG's ownership interests in Northern Tier Energy LP(NTI) for $775 million. [S22] This acquisition included the St. [S23] Paul Park Refinery which increased Western's refining barrel capacity by 89,500 barrels per day. [S24] It also acquired pipeline access to Bakken and Canadian crude oil plus product terminals, storage tanks, rail facilities and Mississippi river dockage. [S25] The company also gained ownership of retail assets that included SuperAmerica retail channel of 163 company operated and 74 franchised convenience stores. [S26] In addition to its refineries, Giant Industries, based in Scottsdale, Arizona, owned a crude-oil-gathering pipeline system based in Farmington, New Mexico, a fleet of crude-oil and finished-product truck transports and a chain of retail service stations and convenience stores in New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona.

      "chunk": "[S1] The company also gained ownership of retail assets that included SuperAmerica retail channel of 163 company operated and 74 franchised convenience stores. [S2] In addition to its refineries, Giant Industries, based in Scottsdale, Arizona, owned a crude-oil-gathering pipeline system based in Farmington, New Mexico, a fleet of crude-oil and finished-product truck transports and a chain of retail service stations and convenience stores in New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona. [S3] ## Current capacity\n\nThe current capacity of the El Paso refinery is 128,000 barrels per day. [S4] An expansion is in the planning stages for 2013/2014 to increase capacity to 150,000 barrel per day. [S5] The refinery near Gallup, New Mexico, has a capacity of 26,000 barrels per day after an expansion during 2012. [S6] Western Refining also owns a refinery in Bloomfield, New Mexico, but it's currently closed. [S7] Western Refining sold the Yorktown terminal and refinery as well as a segment of an oil pipeline in New Mexico to subsidiaries of Plains All American Pipeline Co for approximately $220 million.

[S11] ## Terminals and other locations\n\nWestern Refining has refined products terminals in Albuquerque and Bloomfield, New Mexico, and Yorktown, Virginia, asphalt terminals in Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, Albuquerque, and El Paso. [S12] It also has a fleet of crude oil and finished product truck transports, and wholesale petroleum products operations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Maryland. [S13] ## Retail\n\nWestern owns and operates more than 260 convenience stores and gas stations located in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. [S14] The company markets under its own brands of Giant, Mustang, Sundial, and (through Northern Tier Energy in the Minnesota, Wisconsin and South Dakota) SuperAmerica, plus a number of locations feature the brands of other oil companies. [S15] They also license Western branded fuel to other retail stores. [S16] Western both purchases oil from the Mexican parastatal Pemex and sells refined oil products back to buyers in Mexico.

[S18] The subsidiary, formed as a limited partnership, will operate, develop, and acquire terminals, storage tanks, pipelines and other logistic assets, the company reported in a filing with the U.S. [S19] Securities and Exchange Commission.
