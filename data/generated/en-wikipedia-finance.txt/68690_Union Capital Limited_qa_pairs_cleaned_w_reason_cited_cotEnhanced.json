  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Union Capital Limited in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main points seem to be that Union Capital is a major non-bank financial institution in Bangladesh, listed on two stock exchanges. They had a huge loss in 2024, which is a key financial issue. The history mentions their establishment in 1993, various chairmen and managing directors, and some past events like the 2007 dividend and a syndicated loan. There's a lot about financial struggles since 2018, including not returning deposits and a loan cap by Bangladesh Bank. The 2024 merger with Prime Bank is a significant recent event. Also, subsidiaries are listed, but maybe that's less critical for the summary.\n\nI should focus on the main topic: the company's role, financial troubles, key events, and the merger. Need to mention the losses, the merger with Prime Bank, the financial instability, and maybe the regulatory issues. Avoid too many names and dates unless they're crucial. Make sure to highlight the key concepts like being a non-bank financial institution, the 2024 loss, the merger, and the financial difficulties leading up to it. Keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Let me check if I missed anything important. The part about the 12 billion BDT loans and defaults, and the stock price dropping under face value. Also, the Bangladesh Bank's role in the merger. Okay, that should cover the main points.\n</think>\n\nUnion Capital Limited is a major non-bank financial institution in Bangladesh, listed on the Dhaka and Chittagong Stock Exchanges, but has faced severe financial distress, including a 10.48 billion BDT loss in 2024 and struggles to return deposits, such as a 1 billion BDT liability to British American Tobacco Bangladesh. The company has experienced leadership changes, regulatory scrutiny, and failed loan recoveries, including a 300 million BDT loan default and a 2017 property auction. By 2023, it had issued 12 billion BDT in loans with 5.45 billion in defaults, leading to stock price declines and non-compliance with financial reporting rules. In 2024, Bangladesh Bank approved its merger with Prime Bank amid ongoing financial instability and regulatory challenges. Its subsidiaries, such as Unicap Securities and UNICAP Investments, highlight its diversified financial operations.",
