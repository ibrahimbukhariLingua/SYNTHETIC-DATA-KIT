Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main topic is the Beebe Syndicate, which was a group of electric streetcar and interurban railroads along with construction and finance companies. They were based in Syracuse, New York, and led by Clifford D. Beebe. He started with the Syracuse and East Side Railway in 1894. Then he expanded into interurban railways. At its peak in 1915, the syndicate had 28 companies, but they faced financial trouble, leading to receivership and sales in 1917. Beebe moved to NYC in 1919 and later returned to Michigan, dying in 1937.\n\nThe affiliated companies list includes various railroads and related businesses. The table shows some of the trolley lines. The key points are the formation, growth, financial issues, and dissolution of the syndicate, along with Beebe's role and career moves.\n\nI need to make sure the summary includes the main topic, key concepts like the companies involved, Beebe's role, the growth and collapse, and the aftermath. Avoid listing all companies, just mention they were a network of railroads and finance companies. Highlight the peak in 1915, debt issues, and the sale of assets. Also note Beebe's later career moves. Keep it concise, 3-5 sentences.\n</think>\n\nThe **Beebe Syndicate** was a network of electric streetcar, interurban railroads, and related construction and finance companies based in Syracuse, New York, led by Clifford D. Beebe. Founded in the late 19th century, it expanded to control 28 companies by 1915 but faced financial collapse due to debt, leading to receivership and asset sales by 1917. Beebe, a former banker, shifted focus to real estate after the syndicate's decline, moving to New York City in 1919 and later returning to Michigan, where he died in 1937. The syndicate's affiliated companies included numerous railroads and infrastructure projects, reflecting its broad influence in early 20th-century transportation. Its history highlights the challenges of managing large-scale electric transit systems during a period of rapid but unstable growth.",
