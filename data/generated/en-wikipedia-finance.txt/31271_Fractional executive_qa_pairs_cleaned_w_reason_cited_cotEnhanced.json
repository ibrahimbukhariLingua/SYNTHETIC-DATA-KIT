  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about fractional executives in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document explains what fractional executives are: they're part-time professionals offering management services, not full-time employees. They have experience in high-level roles like CxO positions. They're different from consultants because they take active leadership roles. The main advantage is accessing skilled experts without the cost of a full-time hire. The model is popular among small companies and has gained traction with platforms like A-team and 10x.Team. There are communities supporting these executives, and the trend is expected to grow.\n\nI should make sure to mention the key points: definition, difference from consultants, benefits, target companies, examples of roles, and the growth and communities. Need to keep it concise, avoiding specific examples unless necessary. Also, note the funding and expansion to Europe. Let me structure that into a few sentences without getting too detailed.\n</think>\n\nFractional executives are part-time, highly experienced professionals who provide leadership and management services to organizations on a contract basis, offering specialized expertise without the cost of full-time employment. Unlike consultants or interim managers, they take active leadership roles, implementing strategic changes and driving operations similarly to permanent executives. This model is particularly popular among small entrepreneurial companies and startups, enabling access to top-tier talent while optimizing resource allocation. The concept has gained traction globally, supported by platforms like A-team and 10x.Team, as well as growing communities fostering networking and collaboration. As demand for flexible, cost-effective leadership solutions rises, fractional executives are increasingly seen as a vital component of modern business strategies.",
