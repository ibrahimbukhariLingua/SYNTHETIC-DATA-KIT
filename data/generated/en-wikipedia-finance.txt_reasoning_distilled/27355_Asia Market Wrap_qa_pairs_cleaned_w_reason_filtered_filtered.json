  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Asia Market Wrap in 3-5 sentences. Let me read through the text first.\n\nThe document starts by explaining that Asia Market Wrap was a CNBC Asia program that aired from 1600 to 1800 Hong Kong/Singapore time until December 2005. It was also on CNBC US and later CNBC World. Anchored by Christine Tan, it covered financial news with interviews. Then there are details about segments like Australia Market Wrap and China Business Briefing, and the weekly Asia Market Week. It mentions Martin Soong as a previous presenter and his replacement by Tan. The show was replaced by Worldwide Exchange in 2005, with Tan moving to that show. The anchors list is also provided.\n\nSo the main points are: the show's run time, channels, anchor, content, segments, changes in hosts, and its replacement. I need to condense this. Make sure to mention the time frame, the hosts, the content focus, the segments, and the end date. Also note the replacement program. Avoid minor details like specific dates of anchor changes unless crucial. Keep it concise.\n</think>\n\n*Asia Market Wrap* was a financial news program on CNBC Asia (1600–1800 HK/Singapore time) until December 2005, focusing on market analysis, headlines, and interviews with experts.

That seems to directly answer the question. The original air time is stated here as 1600 to 1800. \n\nOther sentences might have related info. For example, [S5] talks about *Asia Market Week* airing on Fridays, but that's a different show. [S2] mentions the show aired on CNBC US from 5:30 to 6AM ET until 2000, but the question is about CNBC Asia, so that's probably not relevant. [S8] mentions replacement programs, but not the original time. \n\nSo the key sentence is [S1]. The answer should be 1600 to 1800 Hong Kong/Singapore time. I need to make sure there's no other conflicting information. The other sentences don't mention the original time, so [S1] is the correct citation."

The supporting context is provided with several sentences numbered [S1] to [S11]. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out which part of the context answers this. The user wants the answer with citations. Let me go through each sentence.\n\nLooking at the sentences, [S3] mentions Christine Tan as the anchor. Then [S6] talks about Martin Soong being the regular presenter before his departure. [S7] says that when Martin Soong returned to present *Asia Squawk Box*, Tan was moved to present *Asia Market Wrap*. [S10] mentions that Tan continued as the Asian presenter until 2005, and then later it's mentioned that Brian Shactman and Ross Westgate are now anchoring. \n\nBut the question is about the \"later years\" of *Asia Market Wrap*. The program ended in December 2005. So the later years would be towards the end. According to [S10], after 2005, the anchor changed to Brian Shactman and Ross Westgate. However, [S3] says Christine Tan anchored it, but [S10] says she continued until 2005. Then after that, maybe the later years would be when it was replaced by Worldwide Exchange. But the exact time when the anchor changed is in [S10]. \n\nWait, the question is about the later years of the show. The show ended in 2005. So the later years would be 2004-2005. [S3] says Christine Tan anchored it, and [S10] says she was the presenter until 2005. Then after that, the show was replaced. But [S10] also mentions that after 2005, it's anchored by Brian Shactman and Ross Westgate. However, the show ended in 2005, so maybe the later years are when it was still on air. \n\nBut the answer might be Christine Tan, as per [S3] and [S10]. However, [S10] says that Tan continued as the Asian presenter until 2005, and then later it's joined by others. But the show ended in 2005. So during its later years, Christine Tan was the anchor. However, [S10] also mentions that after 2005, the anchors changed, but the show was replaced. So the answer is Christine Tan. But wait, [S10] says \"Tan continues as the Asian presenter of this programme, joined by CNBC's Michelle Caruso-Cabrera... now anchored by Brian Shactman...\" So maybe after 2005, but the show ended in 2005. So perhaps the later years are when it was still on air, so Christine Tan. \n\nBut the question is about the later years of the show. The show ended in 2005. So the later years would be 2004-2005. According to [S11], the anchors list shows Christine Tan from 2004-2005. So the answer is Christine Tan. But [S10] mentions that after 2005, it's anchored by others, but the show ended. So the answer is Christine Tan. However, [S10] says \"Tan continues as the Asian presenter... now anchored by Brian Shactman...\" which might imply that after 2005, but the show was replaced. So maybe during the later years, it was Christine Tan. \n\nBut I need to check the exact sentences. The question is about the later years. The show ended in 2005. So the later years would be when it was still running. The anchors listed in [S11] are Christine Tan from 2004-2005. So the answer is Christine Tan. But [S10] says that after 2005, it's anchored by others, but the show ended. So during its later years, Christine Tan was the anchor. Therefore, the answer is Christine Tan, with citations [S3] and [S10]. But [S10] says she continued until 2005. So the answer would be Christine Tan, and maybe also [S11] which lists her as an anchor. \n\nWait, the user's answer needs to have the statement with the answer and the citations. So the correct answer is Christine Tan, and the citations would be [S3] and [S10], maybe [S11] as well. But [S11] is a list of anchors. Let me check the exact sentences again.\n\n[S3] says \"Anchored by Christine Tan...\" \n\n[S10] says \"Tan continues as the Asian presenter... now anchored by Brian Shactman...\" So during the later years, she was the anchor until 2005, and then after that, it's changed. But the show ended in 2005, so the later years would be when she was anchoring. Therefore, the answer is Christine Tan, with citations [S3] and [S10]. Also, [S11] lists her as an anchor from 2004-2005. So maybe [S11] is also a citation. But the user's instructions say to use the sentence numbers from the supporting context. So the answer would be Christine Tan, with citations [S3][S10][S11]. But I need to check if [S11] is part of the supporting context. The user provided the chunk with [S1] to [S11], so [S11] is part of the context. \n\nBut the question is about the later years. The later years would be the time before the show ended. So Christine Tan was the anchor during that time. Therefore, the answer is Christine Tan, with citations [S3][S10][S11]. However, [S11] is a list of anchors, so maybe it's better to cite [S3] and [S11]. But [S10] also mentions her continuing until 2005. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be Brian Shactman and Ross Westgate, but that's after the show ended. The show ended in 2005, replaced by Worldwide Exchange. So the later years would be 2004-2005, so Christine Tan. Therefore, the correct answer is Christine Tan, with citations [S3][S10][S11]. But I need to check the exact sentences again.\n\nAnother point: [S7] says when Martin Soong returned to present Asia Squawk Box, Tan was moved to present Asia Market Wrap. So that would be around 2003-2004? Then [S11] lists Martin Soong from 1998-2003, Christine Tan 2004-2005. So during the later years (2004-2005), Christine Tan was the anchor. Therefore, the answer is Christine Tan, with citations [S3][S10][S11]. But [S10] says \"Tan continues as the Asian presenter... now anchored by Brian Shactman...\" which might imply that after 2005, but the show ended. So during the later years, she was the anchor. So the answer is Christine Tan, with citations [S3][S11]. [S10] might be referring to after the show ended, but the question is about the show's later years, which would be before it ended. So maybe [S3] and [S11]. \n\nAlternatively, [S10] says \"Tan continues as the Asian presenter of this programme, joined by CNBC's Michelle Caruso-Cabrera (used for 2005-07-10-19 to due General assignment), now anchored by Brian Shactman (2007-10-22-present) and CNBC Europe's Ross Westgate.\" But the show ended in 2005, so the \"now\" here might be after the show ended. So the later years of the show would be Christine Tan. Therefore, the answer is Christine Tan, with citations [S3] and [S11]. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. So the statement would be \"Christine Tan anchored *Asia Market Wrap* during its later years.\" with citations [S3][S11]."

Sentence [S5] talks about ***Asia Market Week***, which is a weekly wrap-up, but that might be a separate program or a part of Asia Market Wrap? The wording says \"aired between 17:30-18:00 on Fridays.\" But the question is about segments within Asia Market Wrap. The title here is ***Asia Market Week***, which might be a different show. The original question is about *Asia Market Wrap*, so maybe [S5] is not part of the segments but a separate program. \n\nOther sentences mention anchors, air times, replacements, etc., but not other segments.

So that's the correct citation. I should make sure there's no other mention. For example, [S5] might be a segment or a different show. The wording is \"Asia Market Week – a weekly wrap-up...\", but since it's in the same paragraph as the original program, maybe it's a segment. But the original question is about the segments included in Asia Market Wrap. The way [S4] is written, it's saying that the program included segments like those three. [S5] might be another segment or a different program. However, the title of [S5] is ***Asia Market Week***, which could be a separate show. The user is asking about *Asia Market Wrap*, so unless [S5] is a segment within it, but the way it's phrased, it's probably a different program.

But according to the anchors list in S11, before Martin Soong (1998-2003), there was Bill Hartley and Lorraine Hahn from 1996-1998. But the question is about before Martin Soong's departure, not before he started. \n\nBut the question is phrased as \"before Martin Soong's departure\". So when he left, who was the presenter? Wait, maybe the answer is Christine Tan? Because in S6, it says that when he returned to present Asia Squawk Box, Tan was moved to present Asia Market Wrap. So perhaps before Martin Soong's departure, the regular presenter was him, and after he left, Christine Tan took over. But the question is asking who was the regular presenter before his departure. Wait, that might be confusing. If he was the regular presenter before his departure, then the answer is him. But maybe the question is asking who was the presenter before Martin Soong joined? But the wording is \"before Martin Soong's departure\".\n\nWait, let me re-read the question: \"Who was the programme's regular presenter before Martin Soong's departure?\" So when Martin Soong left, who was the regular presenter? But according to S6, prior to his departure, he was the regular presenter. So maybe the answer is Martin Soong? But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check other parts.\n\nLooking at S7: \"When he returned to present ***Asia Squawk Box***, Tan was moved to present *Asia Market Wrap* instead.\" So when Martin Soong left (returned to Asia Squawk Box), Christine Tan took over. So before his departure, the regular presenter was Martin Soong. But the question is asking who was the presenter before his departure. So the answer would be Martin Soong. But that seems like the same person. Maybe the question is phrased incorrectly? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking who was the presenter before Martin Soong started, but the wording is \"before Martin Soong's departure\". Maybe there's a translation error. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Christine Tan, as per S3. But S3 says the program was anchored by Christine Tan. However, according to S11, Christine Tan was the anchor from 2004-2005, while Martin Soong was from 1998-2003. So if Martin Soong left in 2003, then Christine Tan took over. So if the question is asking who was the presenter before Martin Soong's departure (i.e., before he left in 2003), then it would be him. But maybe the question is asking who was the presenter before Martin Soong joined? That would be Bill Hartley and Lorraine Hahn. But the question is about before his departure, not before his arrival.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me check the exact sentences again. \n\nS6 says that prior to Martin Soong's original departure, he was the regular presenter. So that implies that before he left, he was the presenter. So the answer would be Martin Soong. But that seems like the answer is himself. But maybe the question is phrased incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking who was the presenter before Martin Soong's departure, meaning after he left. But the wording is \"before Martin Soong's departure\". So \"before his departure\" would mean prior to him leaving. So the regular presenter at that time was him. But that seems odd. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Christine Tan, as per S3 and S11. But according to S11, Christine Tan was the anchor from 2004-2005. If Martin Soong left in 2003, then after his departure, Christine Tan took over. So if the question is asking who was the presenter before Martin Soong's departure (i.e., before he left in 2003), then the answer would be Martin Soong. But if the question is asking who was the presenter after his departure, then it's Christine Tan. \n\nBut the question is clearly \"before Martin Soong's departure\". So the answer should be Martin Soong. However, that seems counterintuitive. Maybe there's a mistake in the context. Let me check the context again. \n\nLooking at S6: \"Prior to Martin Soong's original departure from CNBC Asia, he was the programme's regular presenter (the programme was billed as *Asia Market Wrap with Martin Soong*).\" So this sentence says that before his departure, he was the regular presenter. So the answer is Martin Soong. But the question is phrased as \"before Martin Soong's departure\", which might be a trick question. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Christine Tan, but according to the context, she became the presenter after Martin Soong left. So in S7: \"When he returned to present Asia Squawk Box, Tan was moved to present Asia Market Wrap instead.\" So when Martin Soong left (returned to Asia Squawk Box), Christine Tan took over. Therefore, before his departure, the presenter was Martin Soong. \n\nSo the answer should be Martin Soong. But the question is asking \"before Martin Soong's departure\", which is a bit confusing. But according to the text, the answer is Martin Soong. However, maybe the user intended to ask who was the presenter before Martin Soong joined, which would be Bill Hartley and Lorraine Hahn. But based on the given question, the answer is Martin Soong. \n\nBut looking at the supporting context, the answer is Christine Tan? Wait, no. Let me check S3 again. S3 says the program was anchored by Christine Tan. But according to S11, she was the anchor from 2004-2005. Martin Soong was from 1998-2003. So if the program was running until 2005, then after Martin Soong left in 2003, Christine Tan took over. So before his departure (i.e., during his tenure), he was the presenter. \n\nTherefore, the answer is Martin Soong. But the question is phrased as \"before Martin Soong's departure\", which might be a mistake. However, based on the given text, the answer is Martin Soong. But I need to check if there's any other sentence that mentions someone else. \n\nLooking at S11, the anchors list: Martin Soong (1998–2003), Christine Tan (2004–2005). So before Martin Soong's departure (2003), the presenter was him. After his departure, Christine Tan. \n\nSo the answer should be Martin Soong. But the question is a bit confusing. However, according to the text, the answer is Martin Soong. But maybe the user intended to ask who was the presenter before Martin Soong joined, which would be Bill Hartley and Lorraine Hahn. But the question is about before his departure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Christine Tan, but that's after his departure. \n\nI think based on the given text, the answer is Martin Soong, as per S6. But I need to make sure. Let me check S6 again: \"Prior to Martin Soong's original departure from CNBC Asia, he was the programme's regular presenter (the programme was billed as *Asia Market Wrap with Martin Soong*).\" So this directly states that before his departure, he was the regular presenter. Therefore, the answer is Martin Soong. But the question is phrased as \"before Martin Soong's departure\", which is a bit odd. But according to the text, that's the case. \n\nSo the answer is Martin Soong, and the citation is S6. But maybe there's another sentence. Let me check S3: \"Anchored by Christine Tan...\" but that's during the time when Martin Soong was already there? Or before? According to S11, Christine Tan was from 2004-2005, after Martin Soong's departure in 2003. So S3 might be referring to an earlier time. Wait, the passage is a bit unclear on the timeline. \n\nBut according to S11, the anchors are listed with dates. So Martin Soong was from 1998-2003, then Christine Tan from 2004-2005. So during the time when the program was running until 2005, after Martin Soong left, Christine Tan took over. \n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is Martin Soong, with citation S6. But the user might have intended a different answer. However, based on the given text, that's the correct answer."

S4 mentions it came from the original CNBC US show, Market Wrap, and includes segments like Australia Market Wrap, etc. S5 is about Asia Market Week. S6 and S7 discuss presenters. S8 about not airing on CNBC Australia. S9 says it ended in 2005. S10 mentions current anchors. S11 lists past anchors.\n\nThe purpose would be in S3, which describes what the show did: examining headlines, financial news analysis, interviewing experts. Also, S4 mentions it included various segments, which might be part of its purpose. But the main purpose is probably in S3. Let me check again. The question is about the purpose, so the answer should be that it provided analysis of financial news, interviewed experts, etc. So the answer would be based on S3. Are there other sentences? Maybe S4 as well, but S3 is the main one. So the citation would be [S3]. Wait, S4 talks about the segments, but maybe that's part of the structure rather than the purpose. The purpose is more about examining headlines and analysis. So the answer is from S3. So the statement would be \"The purpose of *Asia Market Wrap* was to examine the day's headlines and numbers, providing in-depth analysis of financial news through interviews with money managers, market experts, and corporate chiefs.\" Cited as [S3]."

The sentence mentions the move to CNBC World after 2000. \n\nOther sentences might have related info. For example, S8 talks about the program not being aired on CNBC Asia's CNBC Australia, but that's about replacement with other programs, not the move after 2000. S9 mentions the end in 2005 and replacement by Worldwide Exchange, but that's later. The key part is S2, which states the move to CNBC World. \n\nI should check if there's any other sentence that might mention another channel.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking who currently anchors *Asia Market Wrap* as of 2007. Let me look through the supporting context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of anchors and the year 2007. The relevant sentences are probably in the latter part. \n\nLooking at sentence [S10], it says: \"Tan continues as the Asian presenter of this programme, joined by CNBC's Michelle Caruso-Cabrera (used for 2005-07-10-19 to due General assignment), now anchored by Brian Shactman (2007-10-22-present) and CNBC Europe's Ross Westgate.\" \n\nThis mentions that by 2007, the anchor is Brian Shactman starting from October 22, 2007. The question is about as of 2007, so if the current time in the question is 2007, then Brian Shactman would be the anchor. \n\nAnother point is sentence [S3], which mentions Christine Tan as the anchor, but that's before 2005. Then [S6] talks about Martin Soong, but he left before 2003. The list in [S11] shows Christine Tan was from 2004-2005. \n\nSo after that, the next anchor mentioned is Brian Shactman from 2007. The user is asking for 2007, so the answer should be Brian Shactman. The citation would be [S10]. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention. The sentence [S10] also mentions Ross Westgate, but it's stated as \"now anchored by Brian Shactman and Ross Westgate.\" So both are anchors. However, the question is about who \"currently\" anchors as of 2007. The exact wording in the context says \"now anchored by Brian Shactman (2007-10-22-present) and CNBC Europe's Ross Westgate.\" So both are anchors. But the user might be looking for the primary one. However, the answer should reflect what's in the text. \n\nSo the answer is Brian Shactman and Ross Westgate. But the question says \"who currently anchors,\" which might be multiple people. However, the original question might expect the main anchor. But according to the context, it's both. Wait, the sentence says \"now anchored by Brian Shactman... and CNBC Europe's Ross Westgate.\" So both are anchors. But the user's question is about 2007. The date in the context is 2007-10-22, so by that time, Brian Shactman was the anchor. But the exact answer depends on the exact time in 2007. However, the question doesn't specify a date in 2007, just \"as of 2007.\" So the answer would be Brian Shactman and Ross Westgate. However, the user might have intended Brian Shactman as the main one. But according to the text, it's both. \n\nBut looking at the original question again, the user might have a specific answer. Let me check the context again. The sentence [S10] says \"now anchored by Brian Shactman (2007-10-22-present) and CNBC Europe's Ross Westgate.\" So as of 2007, after October 22, Brian Shactman is the anchor, and Ross Westgate is also an anchor. However, the exact answer would need to include both. But maybe the answer is Brian Shactman. However, the user's question is about the current anchor as of 2007. The text says \"now anchored by\" which implies that both are anchors. So the answer should include both. But the original question might have a specific answer. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Brian Shactman. \n\nBut according to the given context, the correct answer is Brian Shactman and Ross Westgate. However, the user might have intended only Brian Shactman. But I need to stick strictly to the text. \n\nSo the correct answer is Brian Shactman and Ross Westgate, with citation [S10]. However, the user's question might be looking for Brian Shactman. Let me check the exact wording again. The sentence says \"now anchored by Brian Shactman (2007-10-22-present) and CNBC Europe's Ross Westgate.\" So both are anchors. Therefore, the answer should mention both. But the question is phrased as \"who currently anchors,\" which could be multiple people. \n\nTherefore, the answer is Brian Shactman and Ross Westgate, cited from [S10]."

Then [S7] says that when he returned to present *Asia Squawk Box*, Tan was moved to present *Asia Market Wrap* instead. So here, Christine Tan is mentioned as taking over after Martin Soong left. \n\nAdditionally, in [S11], there's a list of anchors. It lists Martin Soong from 1998–2003, and then Christine Tan from 2004–2005. That confirms that after Soong left in 2003, Tan took over. \n\nAnother point is [S3], which states that the show was anchored by Christine Tan. But I need to make sure that this is after Soong's departure. The timeline in [S11] shows that Soong was there until 2003, and Tan started in 2004. So the answer should be Christine Tan. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of other anchors after Soong. [S10] talks about Tan continuing as the Asian presenter, joined by others later, but the key point here is that after Soong left, Tan was the one who took over. \n\nSo the answer is Christine Tan, and the citations would be [S6], [S7], [S11], and maybe [S3]. Wait, [S3] says \"Anchored by Christine Tan\" but does it specify when? The sentence doesn't mention the timeline, so maybe [S3] is part of the general description. However, [S6] and [S7] directly mention the transition. Also, [S11] gives the exact dates. So the citations should be [S6][S7][S11]. \n\nBut the user wants each sentence to have its own citations. So if I have a sentence stating that Christine Tan was the anchor after Soong, I need to cite the relevant sentences. For example, if the answer is in a sentence that says \"Christine Tan became the anchor after Martin Soong's departure,\" then the citations would be [S6][S7][S11]. \n\nLooking at the supporting context, [S6] mentions Soong's departure and that he was the regular presenter. [S7] says when he returned to *Asia Squawk Box*, Tan was moved to present *Asia Market Wrap*. So that's directly stating the transition. [S11] gives the timeline. So the answer is Christine Tan, with citations from [S6][S7][S11]. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other anchor mentioned after Soong. The [S10] mentions Tan continuing until 2005, then later anchors like Brian Shactman, but that's after 2005. The question is about after Soong's departure, which was before 2003, so Tan is the correct answer."
