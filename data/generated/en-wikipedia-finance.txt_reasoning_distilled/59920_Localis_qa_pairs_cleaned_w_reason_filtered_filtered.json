  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Localis in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document introduces Localis as an independent think tank founded in 2001 in Westminster, UK. Their main focus is on neo-localism, which is about giving local areas more control over globalization's effects. They publish papers on various policy areas like economy, culture, public services, and family life. They've advocated for things like financial autonomy for local authorities and the Right to Buy. \n\nThere are mentions of notable publications, like the 2009 Manchester report that influenced the Greater Manchester Combined Authority. The 2011 report on business rates led to policy changes. The board members and past CEOs are listed, but maybe that's not as crucial for the summary. \n\nKey points to include: what Localis is, their focus on neo-localism, their policy areas, notable reports and their impacts, and maybe the influence on actual policies. I should avoid specific names unless they're pivotal, but the main idea is their role in promoting localism and specific policy recommendations. \n\nI need to make sure the summary is concise, hits the main topics, and highlights the key concepts like neo-localism, their publications, and their influence on policy. Let me structure that into a few sentences without getting too detailed.\n</think>\n\nLocalis is an independent UK-based think tank founded in 2001 that advocates for **neo-localism**, emphasizing greater local control over globalization's impacts through policies like financial autonomy for local governments and devolution. It has influenced key policy shifts, such as the 2015 English business rates retention reform and the establishment of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, as highlighted in its notable reports. The organization focuses on public policy areas including economic reshaping, cultural preservation, and public service reform, often collaborating with figures like Michael Heseltine to promote localized solutions. Its work underscores a commitment to decentralizing power and fostering community-driven governance.",

The sentence lists specific areas like economy, culture, public services, and family life. \n\nI should check if there are other sentences that might add more information. For example, [S6] mentions reports on health and social integration, Local Enterprise Partnerships, and municipal enterprise. But the question is about the policy areas they publish papers on, and [S4] is the main one that lists them. [S6] might be additional, but the user is asking for the areas, so maybe [S4] is sufficient. \n\nWait, the user might want all the areas mentioned. Let me check again. The answer should include all the areas mentioned in the context. [S4] lists four areas. Then [S6] adds health and social integration, Local Enterprise Partnerships, and municipal enterprise. Are those part of the policy areas? The question is about policy areas, so those would be relevant. But the original answer in [S4] is the primary source. However, the user might need all the areas mentioned. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the policy areas they publish papers on. The answer should include all the areas mentioned in the context. So, the answer would be the list from [S4] and [S6]. However, the user's question is asking for the policy areas, so I need to make sure I include all of them. \n\nWait, the user's question is \"What policy areas does Localis publish papers on?\" So the answer is the list in [S4] and [S6].

However, the user might want the answer to be based on the sentences provided. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to provide citations of the sentence number. So the answer should list all the policy areas mentioned in the context, each with their respective citations. However, the answer needs to be in the format where each sentence is in <statement> tags with citations. \n\nWait, the user's answer should be a statement that answers the question, citing the relevant sentences. So the answer would be a sentence that lists all the policy areas mentioned in the context, each with their citations. But the problem is that the policy areas are mentioned in different sentences. \n\nFor example, [S4] lists four areas, and [S6] adds three more. So the answer should combine these. However, the user's answer needs to be in the format where each sentence is a separate statement with citations. But the question is asking for a list of policy areas. So perhaps the answer is a single statement that lists all the areas, citing [S4] and [S6]. \n\nBut according to the response format, each sentence is a separate statement. So if the answer is one sentence listing all the areas, then it would be one statement with citations [S4][S6]. Alternatively, if the answer is split into multiple sentences, each citing their own sources. But the user's question is a single question, so the answer should be a single statement that combines all the information. \n\nSo the correct approach is to create a statement that lists all the policy areas mentioned in the context, citing the relevant sentences. Therefore, the answer would be:\n\n<statement>Localis publishes papers on policy areas including reshaping the economy, culture, tradition and beauty, reforming public services, improving family life, health and social integration, Local Enterprise Partnerships, and municipal enterprise.<cite>[S4][S6]</cite></statement>\n\nBut I need to check if [S6] is about publications. The sentence [S6] says \"The think tank has also published reports on topics including health and social integration, Local Enterprise Partnerships and municipal enterprise.\" So yes, those are policy areas they publish on. Therefore, the answer should include both [S4] and [S6]."

The question is specifically about the period from 2016 to 2018, so he's the one. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of CEOs in other sentences. The rest of the context talks about publications, board members, etc. No other CEOs are mentioned. \n\nSo the answer is Liam Booth-Smith, and the citations are [S9] and [S10]. Wait, but the question is about the entire period from 2016 to 2018. The sentence [S9] says he took over in July 2016, and [S10] says he stepped down in 2018. So he was in charge during that entire time. Therefore, the answer should cite both sentences."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the title of Localis's 2009 report that influenced the Greater Manchester Combined Authority. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of a 2009 report. The chunk starts with information about Localis, their founding, research areas, publications, etc. Then there's a section titled \"Notable publications\" which includes two reports. \n\nThe first one under notable publications is \"*Can Localism Deliver? [S12] Lessons from Manchester*\". The next sentence [S13] mentions that in 2009, Localis published this report. Then [S14] says the report's recommendations influenced the establishment of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority. That seems to match the question. \n\nThe other report mentioned is from 2011, so the 2009 one must be \"Can Localism Deliver? Lessons from Manchester\". The citations here are [S12] and [S13], but the question is about the title. The title is given in the text as *Can Localism Deliver? Lessons from Manchester*. The user might want the exact title as it appears. \n\nI should check if there are any other possible reports, but the rest of the context talks about other publications and board members. So the answer should be the title of the 2009 report, which is \"Can Localism Deliver? Lessons from Manchester\". The citations would be [S12] and [S13], but since the question is about the title, the citation is for the sentence that mentions the report's title and the year. \n\nWait, the user wants the title, so the sentence that states the title is [S12], but the publication year is mentioned in [S13]. However, the title is in [S12]. But the way the context is structured, the title is in the heading. The exact title is \"Can Localism Deliver? Lessons from Manchester\". So the citation for the title would be [S12], and the year is in [S13]. But the question is about the title, so the citation would be [S12]. However, the user might need both citations if the answer is in multiple sentences. But the title is in [S12], and the year is in [S13]. However, the answer is the title, so only [S12] is needed. But the user might need to check if the title is correctly cited. Alternatively, maybe the answer is in [S13], but the title is in [S12]. \n\nI think the correct citation is [S12] for the title. But the user's answer should have the title and the citations. So the statement would be the title, and the citation would be [S12] and [S13] if both are relevant. However, the title is in [S12], and the year is in [S13]. Since the question is about the title, the citation is [S12]. But maybe the answer is in [S13] as well. Let me check the exact text.\n\nLooking at the context:\n\n### *Can Localism Deliver? [S12] Lessons from Manchester*\n\nIn 2009, Localis published a report entitled *Can Localism Deliver? [S13] Lessons from Manchester*.\n\nSo the title is presented in [S12] as *Can Localism Deliver? Lessons from Manchester*, and [S13] is part of the same sentence. So the title is in [S12], but the sentence that mentions the publication year is [S13]. However, the exact title is in [S12]. Therefore, the correct citation for the title is [S12]. However, sometimes the citation might be both if the sentence that states the title is split. But in this case, the title is in [S12], and the year is in [S13]. But the user is asking for the title, so the citation is [S12]. However, the way the context is structured, the title is in the heading, which is [S12], and the sentence in [S13] is part of the paragraph. \n\nSo the answer is \"Can Localism Deliver? Lessons from Manchester\" with citation [S12]. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is in [S13], but the title is in [S12]. The user might need to check. But according to the given structure, the title is in [S12], so the citation is [S12]. However, the sentence that mentions the report's title and the year is [S13]. Wait, the sentence in [S13] says \"In 2009, Localis published a report entitled *Can Localism Deliver? [S13] Lessons from Manchester*.\" So the title is in that sentence, which is [S13]. But the way it's written, the title is split with [S12] and [S13]. Maybe the actual title is \"Can Localism Deliver? Lessons from Manchester\" with the [S12] and [S13] being citations. But the user's context might have the title as *Can Localism Deliver? [S12] Lessons from Manchester* in the heading, and then in the paragraph, the sentence [S13] mentions the same title. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. But the key is that the title is \"Can Localism Deliver? Lessons from Manchester\", and the citations would be [S12] and [S13] because both mention the report. However, the exact title is in [S12], and the publication year is in [S13]. But the user is asking for the title, so the citation would be [S12]. However, the answer might need both citations if the title is in both places. But I think the correct approach is to cite [S12] for the title and [S13] for the year. But since the question is about the title, only [S12] is needed. However, the way the context is structured, the title is in the heading with [S12], and the sentence in [S13] is part of the paragraph. \n\nIn any case, the answer is the title \"Can Localism Deliver? Lessons from Manchester\" with citations [S12] and [S13], but I need to check the exact structure. The user's example shows that if a sentence has multiple citations, they are listed. So the sentence that states the title would have [S12], and the sentence that mentions the year would have [S13]. But the user is asking for the title, so the answer is in the sentence with [S12]. Therefore, the correct citation is [S12]."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what George Osborne announced in 2015 related to Localis's 2011 report. First, I need to find the relevant information in the provided supporting context.\n\nLooking through the chunks, there's a section about Localis's 2011 report called \"The Rate Escape: Freeing Local Government to Drive Economic Growth.\" The context mentions that this report argued for local governments to retain business rates. Then, in 2015, George Osborne made an announcement. The specific sentence here is [S19], which states that Osborne announced English councils could keep all proceeds from business rates, calling it the biggest transfer of power. \n\nI need to check if there's a direct link between Osborne's announcement and Localis's report. The context says the report attracted support from figures like Bob Neill and Miles Templeman, and then Osborne's announcement in 2015. The sentence [S19] directly connects Osborne's action to the report's recommendations. So the answer should be that Osborne announced allowing councils to keep business rate proceeds, citing [S19] and possibly [S17] since that's where the report's argument is mentioned. Wait, the question is about the 2015 announcement related to the 2011 report. The report's main point was about retaining business rates, and Osborne's announcement aligns with that. So the citation for the announcement is [S19], and the report's details are in [S17]. But the question is about what Osborne announced, so the main citation is [S19]. However, the user might need to know that the report's recommendations influenced it, but the direct answer is the statement in [S19]. Let me confirm the exact wording. The passage says \"In 2015, George Osborne announced that English councils would be able to keep all of the proceedings from business rates, calling it 'the biggest transfer of power' in recent history.\" So the answer is that he announced councils could keep business rate proceeds, cited from [S19]. The 2011 report's role is mentioned in [S17], but the actual announcement is in [S19]. So the correct citation is [S19]."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the main argument of Localis's 2011 report on financial autonomy. First, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nLooking at the chunks, there's a section about the 2011 report. Specifically, [S17] mentions that the report argued for local government to be given greater financial autonomy by retaining business rates. Another sentence, [S18], talks about the report attracting support from prominent figures, but the key point is in [S17]. \n\nI should check if there are other citations that might relate. The question is about financial autonomy, and [S5] mentions past publications arguing for greater financial autonomy for local authorities, but that's not specific to the 2011 report. The 2011 report is specifically mentioned in [S17], so that's the main one. \n\nThe answer should state that the main argument was granting local government greater financial autonomy through retaining business rates. The citation would be [S17]. I need to make sure there are no other citations related to the 2011 report. [S18] and [S19] talk about support and quotes, but the actual argument is in [S17]. So the correct citation is [S17]."
