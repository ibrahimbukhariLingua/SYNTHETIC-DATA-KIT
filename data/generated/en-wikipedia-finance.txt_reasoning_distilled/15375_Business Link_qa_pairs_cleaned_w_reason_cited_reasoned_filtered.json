  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Business Link in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document explains that Business Link was a UK government service started in 1992 to support small and medium businesses. It had local advisors, a website, and a helpline. But in 2011, the local network was cut, and the website was merged into Gov.uk. There's also mention of its origins, resistance from political sides, and how it evolved over time. The closure was part of a government restructuring, and similar services exist in other UK regions and countries.\n\nI should highlight the main points: what Business Link was, when it was established, its services, the reasons for its closure, and related services elsewhere. Need to make sure it's concise and covers key concepts like its purpose, structure, closure, and similar initiatives. Avoid too many details about the resistance or specific reports unless they're crucial. Check for the main topic and key concepts as per the user's request.\n</think>\n\nBusiness Link was a UK government-funded initiative launched in 1992 to provide business advice and support to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) through local advisors, a website, and a helpline, aiming to address barriers like poor planning and administrative burdens. Despite initial political resistance and challenges in implementation, it expanded to 89 regional offices by 1996 but faced criticism over costs and inconsistent service quality. The service was phased out in 2011, with its functions absorbed into Gov.uk and replaced by local enterprise partnerships, though similar regional services persist in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. Its closure reflected broader shifts in government policy toward privatization and centralized digital platforms.",

[S2] It consisted of an online portal managed by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and a national telephone helpline. [S3] The service's network of local and regional advisors (under the auspices of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills) was axed in 2011. [S4] The online portal was replaced (along with Directgov) by the Gov.uk website on 17 October 2012, although migration of all services to Gov.uk branding took several years and the telephone helpline was retained for some time. [S5] This government programme is not to be confused with Business Link Magazine Group, a magazine publisher founded in 1988. [S6] ## Origins and launch\n\nThe concept for Business Link was established in 1992 by Michael Heseltine, then President of the Board of Trade, when he was in charge of the Department of Trade and Industry. [S7] The initiative was at first referred to as \"One Stop Shop\", and was launched as Business Link in December 1992. [S8] It replaced a number of services which were considered to be fragmented, such as the Department of Employment's 'Small business development service'. [S9] At the time, research led the government to believe small businesses were reluctant to invest in growth, that they failed to plan ahead and invest in training, that they were swamped with paperwork and relied on too few customers. [S10] These barriers to growth were the driving forces behind the need for the new service. [S11] Previously, the Enterprise Initiative ran from 1988 to 1994. [S12] This government-funded scheme was designed to encourage take-up of external advice (consultancy) by small businesses, by offering grant incentives. [S13] During this three-year period \u02b7\u02b0\u1d49\u207f? [S14] applications were received from 135,700 businesses. [S15] A Wren and Storey report concluded that \u00a31,000 of grant assistance increased sales in a business by \u00a330,000 and created a new job. [S16] An alternative study by Bennett and Robson estimated that take-up of external advice trebled in small businesses with the incentive of grant provision. [S17] The Enterprise Initiative compounded support for intervention in the small business market place. [S18] In 2011, Heseltine said \"I knew that there were very large numbers of small and medium sized enterprises out there who were running on the most rudimentary systems. [S19] If they had a problem, many of them didn't come from a background where they knew of anyone who could help or advise them. [S20] We wanted a team of people who could hold their hand, listen to their problems, have a working knowledge of what business is about, make suggestions, ask questions and be a friend in need.\"\n\n\n### Resistance\n\nDespite being a Conservative-sponsored initiative with apparent cross party support, the proposal for a government-funded \"one stop shop\" immediately hit political resistance. [S21] Reflecting on this period in 2011, Heseltine stated that \"you would have the left wing, which wouldn't have any real interest in effective management of the capitalist system. [S22] And you would have a very powerful element on the right wing of politics that would think it's a matter for the capitalist system to manage itself and government intervention, as they would call it, would be very unattractive. [S23] In truth, when I did it, I did comprehensive presentations to Conservative back benchers so that they could see what I believed an industrial policy was about. [S24] What they felt it was likely to be about were things like backing winners, or subsidising losers. [S25] Now I wasn't in favour of certainly the latter, but once I had done the presentations, I had no complaints.\"",

I need to look through the supporting context provided.\n\nLooking at the passage, there's a section that mentions the online portal being replaced. Specifically, sentence [S4] says: \"The online portal was replaced (along with Directgov) by the Gov.uk website on 17 October 2012...\" So that seems to directly answer the question. The answer here is Gov.uk. \n\nI should check if there are any other sentences that might mention this. The rest of the context talks about the history of Business Link, its origins, resistance, etc., but the key part is in [S4]. There's also a mention of Directgov being replaced along with it, but the question specifically asks about the Business Link portal. So the answer is Gov.uk. The citation for that is [S4]. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other possible answer. The other sentences don't mention anything else replacing it. So the correct answer is Gov.uk with the citation [S4]."

Scanning through the sentences, sentence S6 mentions \"The concept for Business Link was established in 1992 by Michael Heseltine, then President of the Board of Trade...\" That seems to answer the first part of the question, identifying Michael Heseltine as the founder. \n\nThen, the sentence continues: \"when he was in charge of the Department of Trade and Industry.\" That clarifies his role at the time.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the political resistance that Business Link faced during its proposal.

There's a section titled \"Resistance\" which starts at [S21]. Let me check that. \n\n[S21] says: \"Despite being a Conservative-sponsored initiative with apparent cross party support, the proposal for a government-funded 'one stop shop' immediately hit political resistance.\" That's a key point. Then [S22] and [S23] have Heseltine's quotes about the left wing not being interested in effective management of capitalism and the right wing thinking government intervention is unattractive. \n\nAlso, [S24] and [S25] mention Heseltine's presentations to Conservative back benchers, where they thought industrial policy was about backing winners or subsidizing losers. \n\nSo the resistance came from both the left and right wings of politics. The left didn't want government involvement in managing capitalism, and the right opposed government intervention, seeing it as unattractive. The answer should cite these sentences. \n\nI need to make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with the correct citations. The main sentence about resistance is [S21], and the details about the left and right wings are [S22][S23], [S24][S25]. But the user's question is about the political resistance, so the answer should combine these points. \n\nWait, the user wants the answer in the specified format with each sentence and citations. So maybe split into two statements: one stating the resistance and citing [S21], then another explaining the left and right wings with [S22][S23], and maybe [S24][S25] as well. But need to check if those are necessary. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be one statement citing [S21][S22][S23][S24][S25], but the user might prefer breaking it down. However, the example shows that each sentence is a separate statement. So perhaps:\n\nFirst statement: \"Despite being a Conservative-sponsored initiative with apparent cross party support, the proposal for a government-funded 'one stop shop' immediately hit political resistance.\" [S21]\n\nSecond statement: \"The left wing didn't have an interest in effective management of the capitalist system, while the right wing viewed government intervention as unattractive.\" [S22][S23]\n\nThird statement: \"Heseltine's presentations to Conservative back benchers revealed that some thought industrial policy was about backing winners or subsidizing losers.\" [S24][S25]\n\nBut the user's question is about the resistance, so the main points are the left and right wings. The answer should be concise. Maybe combine the left and right into one statement with citations [S22][S23], and the part about the Conservative back benchers as another citation. However, the exact answer needs to be accurate. \n\nI think the key sentences are [S21], [S22], [S23], [S24], [S25]. But the user might want the answer to include all relevant citations. So the final answer would have the statement about resistance from both sides, citing [S21], and then the details from [S22][S23][S24][S25]. But need to structure each sentence properly."

      "chunk": "Chunk:\n\n[S1] Business Link\n\n\n# Business Link\n\n\n\n**Business Link** was a government-funded business advice and guidance service established in England in 1992. [S2] It consisted of an online portal managed by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and a national telephone helpline. [S3] The service's network of local and regional advisors (under the auspices of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills) was axed in 2011. [S4] The online portal was replaced (along with Directgov) by the Gov.uk website on 17 October 2012, although migration of all services to Gov.uk branding took several years and the telephone helpline was retained for some time. [S5] This government programme is not to be confused with Business Link Magazine Group, a magazine publisher founded in 1988. [S6] ## Origins and launch\n\nThe concept for Business Link was established in 1992 by Michael Heseltine, then President of the Board of Trade, when he was in charge of the Department of Trade and Industry. [S7] The initiative was at first referred to as \"One Stop Shop\", and was launched as Business Link in December 1992. [S8] It replaced a number of services which were considered to be fragmented, such as the Department of Employment's 'Small business development service'. [S9] At the time, research led the government to believe small businesses were reluctant to invest in growth, that they failed to plan ahead and invest in training, that they were swamped with paperwork and relied on too few customers. [S10] These barriers to growth were the driving forces behind the need for the new service. [S11] Previously, the Enterprise Initiative ran from 1988 to 1994. [S12] This government-funded scheme was designed to encourage take-up of external advice (consultancy) by small businesses, by offering grant incentives. [S13] During this three-year period \u02b7\u02b0\u1d49\u207f? [S14] applications were received from 135,700 businesses. [S15] A Wren and Storey report concluded that \u00a31,000 of grant assistance increased sales in a business by \u00a330,000 and created a new job. [S16] An alternative study by Bennett and Robson estimated that take-up of external advice trebled in small businesses with the incentive of grant provision. [S17] The Enterprise Initiative compounded support for intervention in the small business market place. [S18] In 2011, Heseltine said \"I knew that there were very large numbers of small and medium sized enterprises out there who were running on the most rudimentary systems. [S19] If they had a problem, many of them didn't come from a background where they knew of anyone who could help or advise them. [S20] We wanted a team of people who could hold their hand, listen to their problems, have a working knowledge of what business is about, make suggestions, ask questions and be a friend in need.\"\n\n\n### Resistance\n\nDespite being a Conservative-sponsored initiative with apparent cross party support, the proposal for a government-funded \"one stop shop\" immediately hit political resistance.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what Michael Heseltine said about small businesses in 2011 regarding their need for support. The supporting context provided is a chunk of text with various sentences numbered from S1 to S25.\n\nFirst, I need to find the part where Heseltine's statements in 2011 are mentioned. Scanning through the context, I see that in the section titled \"Origins and launch,\" there's a mention of Heseltine establishing Business Link in 1992. But the user is asking about 2011. \n\nLooking further down, under the \"Resistance\" section, there's a sentence: \"In 2011, Heseltine said 'I knew that there were very large numbers of small and medium sized enterprises out there who were running on the most rudimentary systems.'\" Then there are more quotes from him in the same paragraph. \n\nThe user's question specifically mentions the need for support. The quotes from Heseltine in 2011 talk about small businesses using rudimentary systems, not knowing where to get help, and needing someone to guide them. The exact sentences are S18, S19, S20. Wait, let me check the numbers again. \n\nLooking at the text: \n\n[S18] The Enterprise Initiative compounded support for intervention in the small business market place. [S19] In 2011, Heseltine said \"I knew that there were very large numbers of small and medium sized enterprises out there who were running on the most rudimentary systems. [S20] If they had a problem, many of them didn't come from a background where they knew of anyone who could help or advise them. [S21] ... \n\nWait, the quotes are in S19 and S20. The actual quotes are in S19 and S20. The user is asking about what he said regarding their need for support. The quotes mention that small businesses had rudimentary systems, didn't know where to get help, and needed someone to hold their hand, listen, and advise. \n\nSo the answer should include those quotes. The citations would be S19 and S20. But I need to check if there are more. Also, the sentence in S18 is about the Enterprise Initiative, which is a different part. The user is focused on 2011 statements. \n\nTherefore, the relevant sentences are S19 and S20. The answer should be a statement citing those two. Let me make sure there's no other mention. The rest of the context doesn't have more quotes from Heseltine in 2011. \n\nSo the answer would be a statement quoting Heseltine's 2011 remarks, citing S19 and S20. The exact wording from the context is: \"I knew that there were very large numbers of small and medium sized enterprises out there who were running on the most rudimentary systems. If they had a problem, many of them didn't come from a background where they knew of anyone who could help or advise them.\" \n\nAdditionally, the next part of the quote in S20 is \"We wanted a team of people who could hold their hand, listen to their problems, have a working knowledge of what business is about, make suggestions, ask questions and be a friend in need.\" But wait, the original text in the context has S19 and S20 as separate sentences. Let me check the exact structure.\n\nLooking at the context:\n\n[S19] In 2011, Heseltine said \"I knew that there were very large numbers of small and medium sized enterprises out there who were running on the most rudimentary systems. [S20] If they had a problem, many of them didn't come from a background where they knew of anyone who could help or advise them. [S21] ...\n\nSo the actual quotes are in S19 and S20. The statement should include both. Therefore, the answer is a statement that includes both quotes, citing S19 and S20. \n\nSo the final answer would be a statement with the quotes from S19 and S20, and the citations [S19][S20]."

[S20] In February 1996, the Institute of Directors published a research paper stating that their members were worried about the declared focus on growth businesses employing between 10 and 249, because this might hurt smaller businesses and disadvantage start ups. [S21] However, contrary to popular belief at the time, businesses of all sizes were able to access Business Link services from the start. [S22] In November 1996, Richard Page, the Minister for Small Business, Industry and Energy, stated in the House of Commons that he was \"disturbed to hear that the impression has been given that we are not there to help all businesses irrespective of size. [S23] My clear message is that Business Link is there to help any business man or woman, irrespective of size of company, because from little acorns grow the big oak trees\".

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how many Business Links were predicted by the DTI to launch by the end of 1993 and how many actually existed by that time.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information. Let me scan through the text.\n\nLooking at the chunk provided, there's a section titled \"Creation and evolution of the network\". In that section, sentence [S12] says: \"The Department of Trade (DTI) predicted 54 Business Links would launch by the end of 1993.\" That's the first part of the answer. So the predicted number is 54.\n\nThen, the next part of the question is how many actually existed by that time. Continuing to read the same section, sentence [S15] states: \"By the end of 1993 (during which time the government spent some \u00a33m on the programme), only three branches of the service had been formed.\" So the actual number is 3.\n\nI should check if there's any other mention of numbers in other sentences. For example, [S17] mentions 21 operators by mid-1994, but that's after 1993. [S18] talks about 89 regional offices at its peak, but that's later too. So the key sentences are [S12] and [S15].\n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with the statement and citations. The first sentence would state the predicted number with [S12], and the second sentence the actual number with [S15]. Each in their own <statement> tags with the respective citations."

[S12] Progress was much slower than anticipated due to each bidder and proposal having to be evaluated by a National Assessment Panel. [S13] Achieving and maintaining the ISO 9001 Quality Management Standard and Investors in People accreditation was a mandatory requirement, and each successful Business Link operator was granted a three-year license. [S14] By the end of 1993 (during which time the government spent some \u00a33m on the programme), only three branches of the service had been formed. [S15] The first opened in Leicester on 27 September 1993, with others following in Birmingham and Congleton. [S16] Halfway through 1994 only 21 Business Link operators were in place. [S17] At the end of 1996 the national roll-out was complete.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 At its peak, Business Link operated through 89 regional offices employing 650 personal business advisors. [S18] In 2005, administration of Business Link services was transferred to the regional development agencies, who mostly chose to contract business support out to private companies. [S19] ### Reception\n\nThe Business Link network employed personal business advisors (PBAs), who worked primarily with businesses that employed between 10 and 249 people (small and medium sized enterprises). [S20] In February 1996, the Institute of Directors published a research paper stating that their members were worried about the declared focus on growth businesses employing between 10 and 249, because this might hurt smaller businesses and disadvantage start ups. [S21] However, contrary to popular belief at the time, businesses of all sizes were able to access Business Link services from the start. [S22] In November 1996, Richard Page, the Minister for Small Business, Industry and Energy, stated in the House of Commons that he was \"disturbed to hear that the impression has been given that we are not there to help all businesses irrespective of size. [S23] My clear message is that Business Link is there to help any business man or woman, irrespective of size of company, because from little acorns grow the big oak trees\". [S24] This contradiction may be explained by the DTI directive requiring the individual new Business Link partnerships to generate at least 25% of their income from outside central government within five years of launch, with the express advice that the most likely source would be the end consumers. [S25] As a result, the Business Links wanted their PBAs to work with growth-oriented businesses but this proved difficult to enforce and implement. [S26] PBAs were recruited from those who ran businesses. [S27] At first some were self-employed earning commission but this did not prove to be self-sustaining.

[S18] It was administered by the private company Serco on behalf of the government. [S19] In 2010 a report from the Central Office of Information found that the site's annual costs were \u00a335m, and it had around 1.2 million users.

[S21] ## Closure\n\nDespite the evidence that the advisers were the most effective part of Business Link, the Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition, elected in 2010, declared their intention to abolish the regional business adviser programmes. [S22] New local enterprise partnerships would take their place but the national website and telephone service would continue. [S23] The website was replaced by the Gov.uk public information website on 17 October 2012. [S24] Content was migrated to the new website, maintaining previous links to redirect users. [S25] Several online services continued, largely unchanged, for a number of years: examples included Contracts Finder (until late 2014) and the Universal Jobmatch service for employers (until at least 2016). [S26] ## Similar services\n\nBusiness Link only operated in England. [S27] The remainder of the UK still has similar regional services:\n\n* Business Gateway, Scotland\n* NIbusinessinfo.co.uk, Northern Ireland (run by Invest Northern Ireland)\n* Business Wales\n\nRegional providers used a rebranded version of the Business Link website.

I need to find the answer in the provided supporting context.\n\nLooking through the chunks, there's a section labeled \"Regional network\" which mentions Business Link's face-to-face service. Then, in sentence S4, it says: \"The service used an IDBT (information, diagnostic, brokerage and transaction) model to advise businesses.\" That seems to directly answer the question. \n\nI should check if there are other mentions of models. Scanning through the rest, there's a mention of \"spreading the jam thinly\" model in S10, but that's about a different approach. The IDBT model is specifically mentioned in S4. \n\nSo the answer should be the IDBT model, cited from S4. No other sentences seem relevant here. The other parts talk about evaluations, closure, similar services, etc., but not the model itself. Yep, S4 is the key here."

The question is about the funding of the regional Business Link service. \n\nLooking at the sentences, S3 is \"## Services\" which might be a heading. Then S4 says: \"Business Link's face-to-face service operated on a regional basis across England and was funded by the relevant regional development agencies (RDAs).\" That seems like the key sentence. So the answer is that it was funded by the regional development agencies (RDAs). \n\nIs there any other sentence that mentions funding? Let me check. S18 mentions the website was administered by Serco, but that's about administration, not funding. S19 says it was administered by Serco on behalf of the government.
