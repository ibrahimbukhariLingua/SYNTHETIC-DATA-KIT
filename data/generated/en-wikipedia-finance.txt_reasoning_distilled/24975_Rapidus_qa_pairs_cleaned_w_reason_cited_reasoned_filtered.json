Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document introduces Rapidus Corporation, a Japanese semiconductor company established in 2022 with support from eight major Japanese companies. Their goal is to produce 2nm chips by 2027. The background mentions Japan's decline in semiconductor competitiveness after the 80s, with companies like Elpida Memory failing. There's a lot about government support, partnerships with IBM, imec, and Tenstorrent, and collaborations with the US. The company is getting significant funding, both from the government and private investments. They're building a factory in Hokkaido, with construction starting in 2023, and plans for a pilot line in 2025. The summary needs to highlight the main points: establishment, goals, government support, partnerships, and the significance in the context of Japan's semiconductor industry.\n\nI should make sure to mention the key players, the 2nm target, the collaboration with IBM and others, the funding, and the strategic importance for Japan's tech industry. Avoid too many dates and specific details, focus on the main concepts. Check for any other important elements like the LSTC and the impact of US-Japan collaboration. Keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Let me piece that together.\n</think>\n\nRapidus Corporation, a Japanese semiconductor manufacturer established in 2022 with support from major companies like Sony and Toyota, aims to produce 2nm advanced chips by 2027 to bolster Japan's semiconductor industry, which has seen declining global competitiveness since the 1980s.

[S2] Rapidus was established in August 2022 with the support of eight major Japanese companies: Denso, Kioxia, MUFG Bank, NEC, NTT, SoftBank, Sony, and Toyota. [S3] The goal of Rapidus is to increase advanced semiconductor manufacturing capacity with a 2 nm process by 2027. [S4] ## Background history\n\nThe semiconductor industry in Japan was highly competitive in the 1980s, with a global share reaching 50%. [S5] However, the 1986 Japan-United States semiconductor agreement\u00a0[ja] concluded to resolve trade friction and the rise of South Korea and Taiwan gradually reduced competitiveness. [S6] In 1999, Elpida Memory was established by integrating the businesses of Hitachi and NEC for DRAM, one of the semiconductors for memory, and later took over the business of Mitsubishi Electric, and at one point acquired the world's third-largest market share in this field. [S7] However, management deteriorated due to the 2007-2008 global financial crisis and the subsequent strong yen induced recession, and although support was provided with government funds, it went bankrupt in 2012. [S8] Elpida was acquired by Micron Technology in 2013, and changed its name to Micron Memory Japan in 2014. [S9] Due to international competition from companies including TSMC, Samsung Electronics, and Intel, the share of Japanese companies in the semiconductor industry as a whole has fallen to 10% as of 2019. [S10] In May 2022, United States President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida met in Tokyo and discussed increased collaboration on important technologies, including semiconductors, nuclear power, space exploration, electric batteries, critical minerals, and supply chains. [S11] The Second Kishida Cabinet's basic policy (*Honebuto no h\u014dshin*) announced on 7 June 2022 included consideration of support for private companies developing next-generation advanced technologies and the establishment of a design and manufacturing infrastructure for next-generation semiconductors in the latter half of the 2020s. [S12] On 29 July 2022, high-level talks were held between the United States and Japan by U.S. [S13] Secretary of State Antony Blinken, U.S. [S14] Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi and Japanese Trade Minister Koichi Hagiuda to discuss collaboration for semiconductors development. [S15] In addition, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's policy speech at the 210th session of the Diet\u00a0[ja] on 3 October 2022 included digital transformation (DX) by encouraging public and private investment, and announced that it would promote the technological development and mass production of next-generation semiconductors through Japan-U.S. [S16] collaboration. [S17] The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has decided to establish the Leading-edge Semiconductor Technology Center (LSTC) as an organization to conduct next-generation semiconductor research in anticipation of joint research between the two countries based on the basic principles of semiconductor cooperation between Japan and the United States agreed on in May. [S18] LSTC and Rapidus collaborate to establish a design and manufacturing platform for next-generation semiconductors in Japan. [S19] ## Company history\n\n\n### 2022",

      "answer": "<statement>Rapidus was established in August 2022, and it was supported by eight major Japanese companies: Denso, Kioxia, MUFG Bank, NEC, NTT, SoftBank, Sony, and Toyota.<cite>[S2]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking when Rapidus was established and which companies supported its founding. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of Rapidus's establishment. Looking at the sentences, [S2] says, \"Rapidus was established in August 2022 with the support of eight major Japanese companies...\" That gives the date. Then the sentence lists the companies: Denso, Kioxia, MUFG Bank, NEC, NTT, SoftBank, Sony, and Toyota. \n\nI should check if there's any other information that might add to this. The rest of the context talks about the background of the semiconductor industry in Japan, Elpida Memory, and other collaborations, but nothing else about Rapidus's founding. The other sentences mention the LSTC and Japan-U.S. collaborations, but those are separate from the initial establishment. \n\nSo the answer should be August 2022, and the eight companies listed in [S2]. The citation for the establishment date and the supporting companies is [S2]. I need to make sure there are no other citations. The user's format requires each statement to have its citations. Since the sentence in [S2] contains both the date and the companies, that's the only citation needed. The rest of the sentences don't add relevant info here. \n\nI should structure the answer with two statements: one for the establishment date and another for the supporting companies, each citing [S2]. Wait, but the user's example has each sentence in separate statement tags. So maybe split into two statements? But the original sentence in [S2] combines both pieces of information. However, the user's instruction says each sentence is inside <statement> tags. So if the answer is in one sentence, then one statement. But the question has two parts: date and companies. So perhaps two statements? Let me check the example again.\n\nThe example shows two sentences, each in their own statement. So if the answer requires two parts, each part should be a separate statement. However, in the context, the information is in one sentence [S2]. So maybe the answer is one statement citing [S2], but the answer has two parts. The user's example allows a single sentence to have both parts. So I can have one statement that answers both parts, citing [S2]. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer would be a single statement: \"Rapidus was established in August 2022, and it was supported by eight major Japanese companies: Denso, Kioxia, MUFG Bank, NEC, NTT, SoftBank, Sony, and Toyota.\" With the citation [S2]. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other citations. The other sentences don't mention the establishment date or the supporting companies. So the correct citation is only [S2]."

[S3] ## Company history\n\n\n### 2022\n\nOn 10 August 2022, Rapidus was established by eight Japanese companies with total investment of 7.3 billion yen for domestic production of advanced semiconductors; with further investments totaling $36 billion expected over a decade. [S4] Rapidus is led by Tetsuro Higashi (who formerly led Tokyo Electron) and Atsuyoshi Koike (who formerly led Western Digital's Japanese subsidiary). [S5] In the same year, METI and the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) publicly solicited applications for advanced semiconductor development consignment projects related to strengthening the foundation of post-5G communication systems, which resulted in 70 billion yen of government subsidies for Rapidus. [S6] On 6 December 2022, the Belgium-based Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre\u00a0(imec) announced it had signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with Rapidus, where both companies will set up a long-term and sustainable collaboration on advanced semiconductor technologies, while Rapidus would plan to mass-produce chips in 2-nanometer technology in Japan in the latter half of 2020s. [S7] On 13 December 2022, IBM and Rapidus announced the development of 2 nanometer node technology, with production of the nanosheet gate-all-around FET (GAA FET) devices previously announced by IBM in 2021 to be done by Rapidus at its fab in Japan. [S8] The 2 nm semiconductor chips which Rapidus is aiming to produce are expected to have up to 45% better performance and use 75% less energy compared to 7 nm chips on the market in 2022. [S9] ### 2023\n\nIn January 2023, representatives of Rapidus and IBM participated in a meeting between Japanese Trade Minister Hagiuda's successor, Yasutoshi Nishimura, and Secretary Raimondo. [S10] In February 2023, Rapidus announced the selection of a site close to the New Chitose Airport in Chitose, Hokkaido for the location of its planned factory. [S11] Rapidus also increased its partnership with imec by joining the latter's \"Core Partner Program\" in April 2023, and in the same month received additional funding of 260 billion yen from the Japanese government. [S12] An estimated $37 billion in total funding is needed before Rapidus can begin production. [S13] In July 2023, Rapidus and Tokyo Electron were discussed as companies that would \"play a major role\" in a new memorandum of understanding between Japan and India that is expected to involve $35.9 billion of investment by Japan in India by 2027 and was officially signed in New Delhi by ministers Yasutoshi Nishimura and Ashwini Vaishnaw for their countries respectively. [S14] This agreement closely followed a similar deal between the United States and India which had been reached by President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June. [S15] Groundbreaking to begin construction on Rapidus' factory in Chitose was held in September 2023. [S16] The company has reportedly been supported by around US$2.5 billion in government subsidies from the Kishida administration thus far. [S17] Dutch equipment manufacturer ASML Holding announced they would also open an office in Chitose with 40-50 technical staff to assist Rapidus. [S18] While full operation is not expected until 2027, a pilot line is expected to start in 2025. [S19] On 17 November 2023, Rapidus signed an agreement with the AI computing company Tenstorrent Inc.

However, the question is about the companies that collaborated. But the context doesn't list the specific names of the companies, just mentions that they are eight Japanese companies. \n\nWait, maybe there's more info elsewhere? Let me check other sentences. For example, [S13] mentions \"Rapidus and Tokyo Electron were discussed as companies that would 'play a major role'...\" but that's in 2023.

However, the exact names aren't listed here. The user might expect the answer to be those eight companies, but since they aren't named, maybe the answer is just that it was eight Japanese companies. But the question says \"companies\" plural, so the answer is the eight companies, but the context doesn't specify which ones. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. \n\nLooking through all the sentences again. [S3] is the only one that mentions the establishment. The rest talk about collaborations later, like IBM, imec, Tokyo Electron, etc., but those might be partners after establishment. So the answer is that eight Japanese companies established it, but their names aren't provided here. So the answer would be the eight companies, but since the context doesn't list them, maybe the answer is as per [S3]. \n\nSo the correct citation is [S3]. The statement would be that the eight Japanese companies collaborated, but since the names aren't given, the answer is based on that sentence."

[S3] ## Company history\n\n\n### 2022\n\nOn 10 August 2022, Rapidus was established by eight Japanese companies with total investment of 7.3 billion yen for domestic production of advanced semiconductors; with further investments totaling $36 billion expected over a decade. [S4] Rapidus is led by Tetsuro Higashi (who formerly led Tokyo Electron) and Atsuyoshi Koike (who formerly led Western Digital's Japanese subsidiary). [S5] In the same year, METI and the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) publicly solicited applications for advanced semiconductor development consignment projects related to strengthening the foundation of post-5G communication systems, which resulted in 70 billion yen of government subsidies for Rapidus. [S6] On 6 December 2022, the Belgium-based Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre\u00a0(imec) announced it had signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with Rapidus, where both companies will set up a long-term and sustainable collaboration on advanced semiconductor technologies, while Rapidus would plan to mass-produce chips in 2-nanometer technology in Japan in the latter half of 2020s. [S7] On 13 December 2022, IBM and Rapidus announced the development of 2 nanometer node technology, with production of the nanosheet gate-all-around FET (GAA FET) devices previously announced by IBM in 2021 to be done by Rapidus at its fab in Japan. [S8] The 2 nm semiconductor chips which Rapidus is aiming to produce are expected to have up to 45% better performance and use 75% less energy compared to 7 nm chips on the market in 2022.

[S10] In February 2023, Rapidus announced the selection of a site close to the New Chitose Airport in Chitose, Hokkaido for the location of its planned factory. [S11] Rapidus also increased its partnership with imec by joining the latter's \"Core Partner Program\" in April 2023, and in the same month received additional funding of 260 billion yen from the Japanese government. [S12] An estimated $37 billion in total funding is needed before Rapidus can begin production. [S13] In July 2023, Rapidus and Tokyo Electron were discussed as companies that would \"play a major role\" in a new memorandum of understanding between Japan and India that is expected to involve $35.9 billion of investment by Japan in India by 2027 and was officially signed in New Delhi by ministers Yasutoshi Nishimura and Ashwini Vaishnaw for their countries respectively. [S14] This agreement closely followed a similar deal between the United States and India which had been reached by President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June. [S15] Groundbreaking to begin construction on Rapidus' factory in Chitose was held in September 2023.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the expected performance improvement of Rapidus' 2nm chips compared to 7nm chips. I need to find the relevant information in the provided supporting context.\n\nLooking through the sentences, I remember that sometimes specific details like performance improvements are mentioned in the context. Let me scan each sentence. \n\nSentence S8 says: \"The 2 nm semiconductor chips which Rapidus is aiming to produce are expected to have up to 45% better performance and use 75% less energy compared to 7 nm chips on the market in 2022.\" That seems directly relevant. The question is about performance improvement, and this sentence states 45% better performance. \n\nI should check if there are other sentences that mention this. Let me quickly go through the rest. S1 to S7 don't mention performance numbers. S9 is about 2023, but the content there is about partnerships and funding. The rest of the sentences after S8 talk about other developments, like the factory location, partnerships, etc. \n\nSo the only sentence that provides the performance improvement is S8. Therefore, the answer should cite S8. The user is asking for the expected performance improvement, and the answer is 45% better performance. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other sentence that might have conflicting information. But from the given context, S8 is the only one. So the answer is 45% better performance, cited from S8."

Let me scan each sentence. \n\nLooking at the chunk provided, sentence [S3] mentions \"Construction work began on September 1, 2023...\" So that's the start date. Then, the same sentence says the ground excavation was completed approximately 21 days later than scheduled. Wait, the question is asking how many days later, so the answer here is 21 days. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of excavation completion. The rest of the sentences talk about other events like opening an office, announcements, funding, etc., but nothing else about the excavation. So the key info is in [S3]. \n\nThe user also asked for citations. Each sentence in the answer needs to have the relevant citations. Since the start date and the 21 days are both in [S3], the citation would be [S3]. \n\nSo the answer should state that construction began on September 1, 2023, and excavation was completed 21 days later, citing [S3].

The announcement here is about being contracted to produce AI chips for Tenstorrent. \n\nI should check if there are other sentences that might add more info. For example, S7 mentions Tenstorrent is the first customer, but the question is about what was announced, which is the contract. S8 talks about the architecture based on RISC-V, but that's more about the technology rather than the announcement. \n\nSo the main citation here is S6.
