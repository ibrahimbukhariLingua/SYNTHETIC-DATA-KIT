  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about water privatization in Jakarta in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the document to understand the main points.\n\nThe document starts by explaining how water privatization in Jakarta began in 1993 with Thames Water and Suez, but the contracts were affected by the 1997 financial crisis. The government froze tariffs, leading to renegotiations. The main goals were to increase service coverage and reduce water losses, but targets were lowered. There were issues with the financial structure, like the deficit between tariffs and charges, and the private companies' performance. The court ruled the privatization illegal in 2015, but the decision was overturned later. The impact on the poor included high costs from vendors and limited access. The water resources faced challenges like flooding and groundwater overuse. The privatization led to increased tariffs and some improvements but also criticism for not meeting targets and neglecting the poor.\n\nNow, I need to condense this. The main topic is water privatization in Jakarta, its origins, key events, outcomes, and controversies. Key concepts include the initial privatization by Thames Water and Suez, the financial crisis's impact, renegotiations, targets for service and losses, the court cases, and the effects on the poor and water resources. I should mention the legal rulings, the financial arrangements, the targets and their outcomes, and the social impact. Also, note the eventual return to public control.\n\nLet me check if I missed anything. The document also talks about the financial mechanisms, like the tariff categories and the deficit between tariffs and charges. The role of PAM Jaya, the regulatory body, and the exit of the private companies. The impact on service quality and the poor's access. The court cases and the final decision. \n\nSo, the summary needs to cover the start of privatization, the crisis and renegotiations, the targets and their outcomes, the legal battles, and the social and financial issues. Keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Avoid too many details but hit the main points.\n</think>\n\nWater privatization in Jakarta, initiated in 1993 through concessions awarded to Thames Water and Suez, aimed to expand service coverage and reduce water losses but faced challenges due to the 1997 financial crisis, tariff freezes, and renegotiations that weakened original targets. The privatization sparked legal disputes, culminating in a 2015 court ruling declaring it illegal for failing to ensure equitable access, though this was later overturned, leaving the system in limbo. Despite some improvements in service, the private operators struggled to meet goals, while the poor faced high costs from vendors and limited infrastructure access, exacerbated by financial mechanisms that prioritized wealthier customers and created deficits for public entities. The case highlights tensions between privatization, public accountability, and the human right to water.",

      "chunk": "Chunk:\n\n[S1] Water privatisation in Jakarta\n\n\n# Water privatisation in Jakarta\n\n\n\n**Water privatisation in Jakarta** began when the British water company Thames Water entered into an agreement with the son of then-President Suharto in 1993 to obtain a water concession. [S2] Under the influence of the French water company Suez, however, the government decided to split the city's service area between the two companies. [S3] The government awarded Thames Water and Suez each a concession for one half of the city without competitive bidding. [S4] The contracts foresaw water charge increases that would allow the companies to earn a comfortable 22 percent rate of return. [S5] However, only two months after the contracts were signed, the Indonesian rupiah massively lost in value due to the East Asian financial crisis, and President Suharto was toppled. [S6] The concessions survived, but the government imposed a tariff freeze and the contracts had to be renegotiated to reduce their targets. [S7] In 2006 Suez sold half and Thames Water all its shares to Indonesian investors. [S8] The main targets of the concession were to increase service coverage from an initial 46 percent and to reduce water losses from 61 percent. [S9] The original target of the concessions was to reach 75 percent service coverage in 2008 and 100 percent at the end of the concession. [S10] They also aimed to reduce water losses to 25 percent by 2008 and 20 percent by the end of the concession. [S11] These targets were substantially loosened during the renegotiations: The new 2008 targets were 68 percent for service coverage and 42 percent for water losses. [S12] In 2008 service coverage reached only 64 percent and water losses were reduced to only 50 percent. [S13] During the same period, water tariffs increased threefold. [S14] This increase was partly due to increases in the cost of electricity and bulk water purchases which are passed through by the private companies to the customers. [S15] On 24 March 2015 the Central Jakarta District Court ruled the privatisation of Jakarta's water was illegal and ordered the return of the water system to public control. [S16] The court noted that the private operators were \"negligent in fulfilling the human right to water for Jakarta's residents.\" The private operators won an appeal in the Jakarta High Court. [S17] In October 2017, the Indonesian Supreme Court overturned the appeal and confirmed the District Court Ruling that the privatization of Jakarta's water was an illegal act. [S18] ## Background\n\nTo understand the context of water privatisation in Jakarta, it is useful to know the water use pattern of residents, in particular of the poor, the particular financial mechanism of the concessions in Jakarta, the various types of water resources on which the city relies, and about other water-related challenges that are not directly related to privatisation such as floods, groundwater overexploitation and land subsidence. [S19] ### Water and the poor\n\nAccording to a household survey concerning water use that was carried out in 2005 among 110 poor households in various neighbourhoods, poor households typically rely on a variety of water sources, including foremost network water, vended water and groundwater. [S20] Network water and groundwater are usually bought from other households that have a connection or a well, or from public hydrants that are operated by private vendors. [S21] Use of different water sources varies over time depending on changes in quality, availability and pressure. [S22] Some households also collect rainwater. [S23] According to the survey, vendor water was 10 to 32 times more expensive than piped water and 43 percent of surveyed households spent more than 5 percent of their income for water.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking when water privatisation in Jakarta began and which companies were involved in the initial agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage starts with \"Water privatisation in Jakarta\" and then has several sentences. Let me go through each sentence to find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at sentence S1: It mentions that water privatisation began when Thames Water entered an agreement with Suharto's son in 1993. That seems like the start date. Then, under the influence of Suez, the government split the service between the two companies. So the initial companies would be Thames Water and Suez. \n\nSentence S3 says the government awarded both companies concessions without competitive bidding. So that confirms the two companies involved. The question is about the initial agreement, so the answer would be 1993 with Thames Water and Suez.\n\nI should check if there's any other info that might contradict this. The rest of the sentences talk about the financial crisis, renegotiations, sales of shares, etc., but the initial agreement is covered in S1 and S3. The answer should be based on those sentences. So the answer is 1993 with Thames Water and Suez."

There's a section starting with [S15] which says the Central Jakarta District Court ruled the privatisation illegal and ordered the return to public control.

[S3] According to the survey, vendor water was 10 to 32 times more expensive than piped water and 43 percent of surveyed households spent more than 5 percent of their income for water. [S4] The poor indicated they were not so much concerned about the tariff charged by the private water companies, since it was much lower than the prices they had to pay to private vendors. [S5] They were much more concerned about the high connection fees to the network that were unaffordable for most of them. [S6] While wealthier residents use suction pumps and storage tanks to improve supply, poorer residents suffer more from low pressure and intermittent supply. [S7] Water vendors are not effectively regulated in terms of service quality and prices charged. [S8] Obtaining water from private wells or hydrants involves queuing of up to two hours and costs of 15,000 Rupiahs (US$1.66) per month and family. [S9] Bottled water was also frequently bought at a cost of up to 85,000 Rupiahs (US$9.44) per month and family. [S10] Water from wells is often polluted with bacteria and salty, with salt levels increasing in the Northern parts of the city closer to the coast. [S11] Groundwater in some areas has high iron content and needs to be filtered. [S12] According to the Jakarta Environmental Management Body 90 percent of groundwater was contaminated by metal, nitrate and e-coli in 2011. [S13] Boiling of water is frequent. [S14] Water from the public network, including at public hydrants, is sometimes only available for several hours per day and not always of good quality. [S15] ### Financial arrangements and the concessions\n\nUnder a concession contract, a private company operates, maintains and expands infrastructure owned by the government for a given period which is usually 20 to 30 years. [S16] The private operator is in charge of financing all the investments and collects tariff revenues from the customers on behalf of the government. [S17] In exchange for its services it is allowed to earn a rate of return, which is usually derived from the tariff revenues that are usually passed on to the private operator. [S18] However, the Jakarta concessions are based on an unusual financial arrangement. [S19] It consists of *water tariffs* collected by the private operators on behalf of the provincial government of Jakarta, which are separate from *water charges* paid by the government to the private operators. [S20] The original idea was that tariffs billed to customers would be higher than charges paid to the private operators. [S21] The resulting surplus would have allowed the government to pay back the debt owed to the central government resulting from international loans. [S22] These loans had been incurred to build up the city's water infrastructure in previous years, totalling a staggering 1.6 trillion Rupiahs (USD 400 million at the pre-crisis exchange rate). [S23] The charge to the private operators is a fixed amount of Rupiahs per m\u00b3, independently of whether the water users are in a poor or wealthy category. [S24] It was set in such a way that the private companies would earn a rate of return of 22 percent. [S25] This charging system was designed to provide an incentive to private operators to connect the poor despite their low revenue potential. [S26] However, today the authorities question the usefulness of this system since it creates a shortfall for the public sector. [S27] **Water tariffs**. [S28] Tariffs in Jakarta are differentiated between seven customer categories, with customers in the highest category paying 14 times more than those in the lowest category:",

This system was designed so that tariffs billed to customers would be higher than charges paid to operators, creating a surplus to repay debt from infrastructure loans. However, the charges to private operators are a fixed amount per cubic meter, regardless of customer category, set to ensure a 22% rate of return and incentivize connecting low-revenue poor households.<cite>[S19][S23][S24][S25]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the unique financial arrangement in Jakarta's water concessions. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for keywords like \"financial arrangement,\" \"concessions,\" or \"Jakarta.\" There's a section starting with [S15] \"Financial arrangements and the concessions.\" That seems relevant. \n\nLooking at [S15], it mentions that under a concession contract, a private company operates government-owned infrastructure for 20-30 years. Then, in [S18], it states that Jakarta's concessions have an unusual financial arrangement. The next sentences elaborate: [S19] talks about water tariffs collected by private operators on behalf of the government, separate from water charges paid by the government to the private operators. \n\nThe key point here is the separation of tariffs and charges. The original idea was that tariffs would be higher than charges, creating a surplus to pay back debt. But the unique part is the distinction between the two. Also, [S23] mentions the charge to private operators is a fixed amount per m\u00b3, regardless of customer category, set to give a 22% return. \n\nSo the unique arrangement is the separation of water tariffs (collected from customers) and water charges (paid to operators), with the latter being a fixed rate. This is mentioned in [S19], [S20], [S21], [S22], [S23], [S24], and [S25]. The citation should include these sentences. \n\nI need to make sure the answer clearly states that the unique arrangement involves separate tariffs and charges, with the charges being fixed and designed to incentivize connecting poor areas. The citations would be [S19][S20][S21][S22][S23][S24][S25]. \n\nWait, the user wants each sentence in the answer to have its own citations. So if the answer is one sentence, it should have all the relevant citations. Let me check the exact wording. The answer should be a statement with citations. So the statement would be about the unique financial arrangement being the separation of tariffs and charges, with the fixed charges and the purpose. So the citations would be [S19][S23][S24][S25], maybe others. But the exact sentences that explain this are [S19], [S23], [S24], [S25], and possibly [S20][S21][S22]. However, the main points are in [S19], [S23]-[S25]. \n\nI think the answer should be a single statement citing those sentences. Let me structure it properly."

The rest of the sentences talk about other aspects like rainwater, connection fees, or financial arrangements, which aren't directly related. So the answer is based on S3.

      "chunk": "Chunk:\n\n[S1] However, today the authorities question the usefulness of this system since it creates a shortfall for the public sector. [S2] **Water tariffs**. [S3] Tariffs in Jakarta are differentiated between seven customer categories, with customers in the highest category paying 14 times more than those in the lowest category:\n\n* Category I is a highly preferential tariff for social institutions such as mosques and public hydrants (1% of all connections in 2003);\n* Category II includes a preferential tariff for very poor households as well as public hospitals (IIa, 12% of all connections) and poor households (IIb, 47%);\n* Category III includes a regular tariff for middle-income households and small businesses (IIIa, 20%) as well as upper middle-income households and government offices (IIIb, 15%);\n* Category IV is a high tariff designed to provide revenues to cross-subsidize users in the preferential tariff categories. [S4] It includes large hotels, highrise buildings, banks and factories (IVa, 5%) and the port (IVb, 1%). [S5] Thus 6% of the wealthier customers, using a much larger share of the total volume of water sold, subsidize 60% of the water users, using a much smaller share of the water sold, who are poor. [S6] In 2010 customers in Category IVa paid 9,880 Rupiahs (USD 1.00) per m\u00b3, while mostly poor customers in Category II paid only 1,050 Rupiahs (USD 0,11) per m\u00b3. [S7] In 2006 the average water tariff in 2006 was about 6,000 Rupiahs (USD 0.62). [S8] For comparison, the water charge was 7,020 Rupiahs (USD 0.73) in 2007. [S9] **Deficit between water tariffs and water charges**. [S10] There are two problems with this charging system: First, the water charge is indexed to inflation and is supposed to be automatically increased every six months, while water tariff increases have to be approved by the City Council. [S11] In the aftermath of the East Asian Crisis, the City Council froze the water tariff, thus creating a deficit for the government-owned Asset Holding Company *Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya* (PAM Jaya) as early as the second half of 1998. [S12] Second, the more poor people were connected the lower the average tariff collected would become because of the tariff structure. [S13] The public contract partner of the private companies, PAM Jaya, however, receives higher revenues from commercial customers and wealthier residential customers since these pay higher tariffs than the poor residential customers. [S14] The more poor people are connected by the private operators, the greater the deficit of the public holding company would become, since for each new poor customer it had to pay a charge to the private companies that was higher than the tariff paid by the customer. [S15] PAM Jaya thus actually discourages the private companies to connect the poor to the network by seeking a \"balanced composition of connections\" in order not to further increase the burden on the budget of the province of Jakarta. [S16] Indeed, between 1998 and 2004 only 25% of TPJ's new connections were in the two poorest categories, while 60% of existing customers in 2003 were in these categories. [S17] As a result of these factors, PAM Jaya has not fully paid the charges to the operators and has accumulated arrears to them. [S18] These arrears could reach Rupiahs 18.2 trillion (1.9bn USD) until the end of the contracts in 2022, if the water tariff remains frozen from 2007 until 2022.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the percentage of customers in the highest and lowest water tariff categories according to the text. I need to find the answer in the provided supporting context.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the passage for any mentions of percentages related to customer categories. Looking at the sentences, [S3] mentions that there are seven customer categories. Then, under the breakdown of categories, Category I is 1% of all connections in 2003. Category IIa is 12% and IIb is 47%. Wait, but the question is about the highest and lowest. \n\nIn [S3], it says the highest category pays 14 times more than the lowest. Then, looking at the categories listed: Category I is the lowest? Or is there a higher category? The highest category is probably Category IVa or IVb. But the percentages given are for Category I (1%), IIa (12%), IIb (47%), IIIa (20%), IIIb (15%), IVa (5%), IVb (1%). \n\nWait, the lowest category would be Category I at 1%, and the highest category is probably Category IVa or IVb? But the text doesn't explicitly state the highest category's percentage. However, the question is about the percentage of customers in the highest and lowest. The lowest is 1% (Category I). For the highest, maybe Category IVa is 5% and IVb is 1%, but those are lower than some other categories. Wait, Category IIb is 47%, which is higher. But the highest tariff is in Category IV, but the percentages for IVa and IVb are 5% and 1%. \n\nWait, maybe the highest category is Category IV, but the percentage of customers in that category is 5% (IVa) + 1% (IVb) = 6%? But the text doesn't combine them. The question is about the highest and lowest. The lowest is 1% (Category I). The highest might be Category IIb at 47%? But that's a higher percentage, but the tariff is lower. Wait, the text says that the highest category pays 14 times more than the lowest. So the highest tariff category is probably Category IV, but the percentage of customers in that category is 5% (IVa) and 1% (IVb). But the question is about the percentage of customers in the highest and lowest categories. \n\nWait, the text says \"Category I is a highly preferential tariff for social institutions... (1% of all connections in 2003);\" and \"Category IV includes large hotels, highrise buildings, banks and factories (IVa, 5%) and the port (IVb, 1%).\" So the highest tariff category is IV, but the percentage of customers in that category is 5% (IVa) + 1% (IVb) = 6%. But the text doesn't explicitly state that. However, the question is about the percentage of customers in the highest and lowest. The lowest is 1% (Category I). The highest is 5% (IVa) or 1% (IVb)? But IVa is 5%, which is higher than some other categories. But maybe the highest category is IVa, which is 5%. However, the text doesn't explicitly say that the highest category is IV. But since the highest tariff is in IV, and the percentages for IVa and IVb are 5% and 1%, then the highest category's percentage is 5%. \n\nBut the user is asking for the percentage of customers in the highest and lowest. So the answer would be 1% for the lowest (Category I) and 5% for the highest (Category IVa). But I need to check the text again. \n\nLooking back at [S3], it says \"customers in the highest category paying 14 times more than those in the lowest category.\" Then, the breakdown shows Category I at 1%, and Category IVa at 5% and IVb at 1%. So the lowest is 1% (Category I), and the highest category's percentage is 5% (IVa). However, the text doesn't explicitly state that the highest category is IV. But since the highest tariff is in IV, and the percentages for IVa is 5%, that's the highest percentage among the categories listed. Wait, Category IIb is 47%, which is higher than 5%. But that's a lower tariff. So the highest tariff category is IV, but the percentage of customers in that category is 5% (IVa) and 1% (IVb). So the highest category's customer percentage is 5% (IVa). \n\nTherefore, the answer is 1% for the lowest (Category I) and 5% for the highest (Category IVa). The citations would be [S3] for the 1% and [S3] again for the 5% (since IVa is mentioned in [S4]). Wait, [S3] mentions the highest category paying 14 times more, and [S4] mentions IVa as 5% and IVb as 1%. So the 1% is from [S3], and the 5% is from [S4]. \n\nSo the statement would be: The percentage of customers in the lowest category is 1% (from [S3]) and the highest is 5% (from [S4]). But need to check if there's any other mentions. Also, [S16] mentions 25% of new connections were in the two poorest categories, but that's not directly relevant. \n\nSo the answer is 1% (lowest) and 5% (highest). Citations: [S3] for 1%, [S4] for 5%."

      "chunk": "Chunk:\n\n[S1] However, today the authorities question the usefulness of this system since it creates a shortfall for the public sector. [S2] **Water tariffs**. [S3] Tariffs in Jakarta are differentiated between seven customer categories, with customers in the highest category paying 14 times more than those in the lowest category:\n\n* Category I is a highly preferential tariff for social institutions such as mosques and public hydrants (1% of all connections in 2003);\n* Category II includes a preferential tariff for very poor households as well as public hospitals (IIa, 12% of all connections) and poor households (IIb, 47%);\n* Category III includes a regular tariff for middle-income households and small businesses (IIIa, 20%) as well as upper middle-income households and government offices (IIIb, 15%);\n* Category IV is a high tariff designed to provide revenues to cross-subsidize users in the preferential tariff categories. [S4] It includes large hotels, highrise buildings, banks and factories (IVa, 5%) and the port (IVb, 1%). [S5] Thus 6% of the wealthier customers, using a much larger share of the total volume of water sold, subsidize 60% of the water users, using a much smaller share of the water sold, who are poor. [S6] In 2010 customers in Category IVa paid 9,880 Rupiahs (USD 1.00) per m\u00b3, while mostly poor customers in Category II paid only 1,050 Rupiahs (USD 0,11) per m\u00b3. [S7] In 2006 the average water tariff in 2006 was about 6,000 Rupiahs (USD 0.62). [S8] For comparison, the water charge was 7,020 Rupiahs (USD 0.73) in 2007. [S9] **Deficit between water tariffs and water charges**. [S10] There are two problems with this charging system: First, the water charge is indexed to inflation and is supposed to be automatically increased every six months, while water tariff increases have to be approved by the City Council. [S11] In the aftermath of the East Asian Crisis, the City Council froze the water tariff, thus creating a deficit for the government-owned Asset Holding Company *Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya* (PAM Jaya) as early as the second half of 1998. [S12] Second, the more poor people were connected the lower the average tariff collected would become because of the tariff structure. [S13] The public contract partner of the private companies, PAM Jaya, however, receives higher revenues from commercial customers and wealthier residential customers since these pay higher tariffs than the poor residential customers. [S14] The more poor people are connected by the private operators, the greater the deficit of the public holding company would become, since for each new poor customer it had to pay a charge to the private companies that was higher than the tariff paid by the customer. [S15] PAM Jaya thus actually discourages the private companies to connect the poor to the network by seeking a \"balanced composition of connections\" in order not to further increase the burden on the budget of the province of Jakarta. [S16] Indeed, between 1998 and 2004 only 25% of TPJ's new connections were in the two poorest categories, while 60% of existing customers in 2003 were in these categories. [S17] As a result of these factors, PAM Jaya has not fully paid the charges to the operators and has accumulated arrears to them. [S18] These arrears could reach Rupiahs 18.2 trillion (1.9bn USD) until the end of the contracts in 2022, if the water tariff remains frozen from 2007 until 2022.",
      "question": "What was the main reason for the deficit faced by PAM Jaya according to the text?",
      "answer": "<statement>The main reason for the deficit faced by PAM Jaya was the freezing of water tariffs by the City Council following the East Asian Crisis, which created a shortfall as early as the second half of 1998.<cite>[S11]</cite></statement> <statement>This deficit was exacerbated by the structure of water tariffs, where higher tariffs for wealthier customers were intended to cross-subsidize poorer users, but the frozen tariffs prevented revenue adjustments to cover costs.<cite>[S10][S11]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the main reason for the deficit faced by PAM Jaya according to the text. I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the sentences to find mentions of PAM Jaya and the deficit. Looking at the chunk provided, there's a section starting with [S9] \"Deficit between water tariffs and water charges.\" Then, [S10] talks about two problems with the charging system. The first problem is about water charges being indexed to inflation and automatically increased, while tariffs need council approval. \n\nThen, [S11] specifically mentions that after the East Asian Crisis, the City Council froze water tariffs, leading to a deficit for PAM Jaya as early as 1998. This seems like a key point. Also, [S14] and [S15] discuss how connecting more poor customers increases the deficit because PAM Jaya has to pay higher charges to private companies than the tariffs collected. However, the initial cause mentioned in [S11] is the freezing of tariffs by the City Council, which is directly linked to the deficit. \n\nThe question is about the main reason. The text states that the freezing of tariffs by the City Council created the deficit. Additionally, the structure of tariffs where higher categories pay more but the poor are subsidized might contribute, but the direct reason given in the text is the tariff freeze. So the answer should cite [S11] and possibly [S10] for the context of the two problems. However, the main reason is the tariff freeze leading to the deficit. Let me check if there are other sentences. [S17] mentions PAM Jaya not paying charges and accumulating arrears, but that's a result, not the main reason. \n\nSo the main reason is the City Council freezing water tariffs, causing the deficit. The citation would be [S11]. Also, [S10] explains the problem with the system, but the direct cause is [S11]. Therefore, the answer should reference [S11]."

[S26] The private companies mostly buy raw water at a relatively low price from *Perum Jasa Tirta II*, a state-owned company that operates the West Tarum Canal system. [S27] The system provides 80 percent of the raw water supply for Jakarta. [S28] Its water comes from Jatiluhur reservoir on the Citarum River 70\u00a0km southeast of the city. [S29] According to a 2007 report by the Asian Development Bank, there was a risk for the water supply of Jakarta from inadequate maintenance and repair of the canal and associated pumping stations.

[S3] ## History\n\n\n### Prelude (1993-1997)\n\nIn 1993 the British water company Thames Water International set foot in Indonesia with the aim of gaining a concession contract for Jakarta. [S4] For this purpose it entered into an agreement with Sigit Harjojudanto, one of the sons of then President Suharto. [S5] Sigit's firm PT Kekar Pola Airindo \u2013 which had no experience in water supply - received 20 percent of shares in a joint venture with Thames Water. [S6] The French water company Lyonnaise des Eaux, now Suez Environnement, which had been active in Indonesia before, was afraid of being left behind. [S7] It already had a joint venture with the Salim Group of Anthony Salim, a crony of Suharto, for the production and distribution of industrial water in the Serang area of Jakarta since 1994. [S8] Together they created the joint venture PT Garuda Dipta Semesta (now called Palyja). [S9] Salim, not wanting to confront the President, was at first cautious. [S10] But when Lyonnaise des Eaux managed to convince the government to split up the Jakarta concession in two halves, each of which would be awarded without competition to one of the two groups, Salim acquiesced. [S11] In 1995 the government issued letters of invitation to Lyonnaise des Eaux and Thames Water International to begin negotiations for concessions. [S12] The two companies then completed feasibility studies in 1996. [S13] Negotiations took more than a year and were tedious. [S14] One issue was that the private companies requested to be paid in foreign currency, a request that was successfully opposed by the then Governor of Jakarta. [S15] Apparently the World Bank had pressured the Indonesian government in the early 1990s to privatise water supply. [S16] However, the Second Jabotabek Urban Development Project, a major water project for Jakarta approved by the World Bank's board in 1990, included no conditions for privatisation. [S17] ### Concession award (1997)\n\nIn June 1997 the two 25-year water concessions were awarded, becoming effective in February 1998. [S18] The subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux, called PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya (**Palyja**), was awarded the concession for the western part of the city while the subsidiary of Thames Water International, called Thames PAM Jaya (**TPJ**), was awarded the concession for the eastern part. [S19] The concessions aimed to achieve universal service coverage and a reduction of non-revenue water to 20 percent at the end of the concession period. [S20] To that end the concessions foresaw private investments of Rupiahs 1,520 billion during the first five years of the concession alone. [S21] This corresponded to USD 610 million at the exchange rate at signing before the financial crisis. [S22] However, after the devaluation of the Rupiah during the East Asian financial crisis the value of these investment commitments dropped to USD 160 million. [S23] In the turmoil following the toppling of Suharto, most expatriates fled the country and the Director General of PAM Jaya moved to cancel the concession contracts. [S24] British and French executives and diplomats then convinced the central government to maintain the concessions, after the foreign companies separated themselves from their Indonesian partners tainted by their association with the former regime. [S25] The City Council, after having approved tariff increases of 15 percent in February 1998 despite the crisis, was soon faced with riots and froze the tariffs for the next three years. [S26] ### Renegotiations (2001-2004) and establishment of a regulator",
      "question": "Which companies were awarded water concessions in Jakarta in 1997, and for which areas?",
      "answer": "<statement>The companies awarded water concessions in Jakarta in 1997 were PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya (Palyja), a subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux, and Thames PAM Jaya (TPJ), a subsidiary of Thames Water International, for the western and eastern parts of the city, respectively.<cite>[S18][S19]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which companies were awarded water concessions in Jakarta in 1997 and for which areas. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage mentions the history of water concessions in Jakarta. Specifically, under the \"Concession award (1997)\" section, there's a sentence that says: \"In June 1997 the two 25-year water concessions were awarded, becoming effective in February 1998. The subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux, called PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya (Palyja), was awarded the concession for the western part of the city while the subsidiary of Thames Water International, called Thames PAM Jaya (TPJ), was awarded the concession for the eastern part.\"\n\nSo, the companies are Palyja (subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux) and TPJ (subsidiary of Thames Water International). The areas are the western and eastern parts of Jakarta, respectively. \n\nI should check if there are any other mentions of companies or areas. The context also talks about Palyja using water from the Kali Krukut and Ciliwung rivers, but that's about water sources, not the concessions. The other sentences mention the history leading up to the 1997 awards, like the joint ventures with Sigit Harjojudanto and the Salim Group, but those are more about the pre-1997 activities. \n\nThe key sentence here is [S18] and [S19]. The answer should cite those. Let me make sure there's no other information. The user might be looking for the exact names of the companies and the areas. The answer is straightforward from [S18] and [S19]. \n\nSo, the statement would be: The companies awarded water concessions in Jakarta in 1997 were PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya (Palyja), a subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux, and Thames PAM Jaya (TPJ), a subsidiary of Thames Water International. Palyja was awarded the western part of the city, while TPJ was awarded the eastern part. \n\nCitations would be [S18] and [S19]. I need to format each sentence properly with the citations. Since the answer has two sentences, each should have their own <statement> tags with the citations. Wait, the user's example shows each sentence in separate <statement> tags. So, I should split the answer into two sentences if needed. But the answer can be in one sentence. Let me check the example again. The example has two sentences, each in their own <statement> with citations. So, maybe the answer can be one sentence with both citations. \n\nAlternatively, if the answer is one sentence, it would be: \"The companies awarded water concessions in Jakarta in 1997 were PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya (Palyja), a subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux, and Thames PAM Jaya (TPJ), a subsidiary of Thames Water International, for the western and eastern parts of the city, respectively.\" Cited as [S18][S19]. \n\nYes, that's concise and covers both parts. So the final answer would be that sentence with the citations."

[S2] The City Council, after having approved tariff increases of 15 percent in February 1998 despite the crisis, was soon faced with riots and froze the tariffs for the next three years. [S3] ### Renegotiations (2001-2004) and establishment of a regulator\n\nDue to the impact of the 1997 East Asian financial crisis the contracts were renegotiated through a \"Restated Cooperative Agreement\" signed in October 2001. [S4] The agreement also foresaw the creation of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body (JWSRB) as an \"independent\" regulator in charge of supervising the concessions and reviewing requests for tariff increases on behalf of the Governor of Jakarta and the Ministry of Public Works. [S5] Initially, PAM Jaya had the responsibility to monitor the performance of the two private companies on behalf of the city government in addition to being an asset holding company. [S6] By creating the regulatory body the regulatory function was to be clearly separated from the asset holding function, thus avoiding a possible perception of a conflict of interest. [S7] In April 2001 the City Council approved a tariff increase of 35 percent, while leaving tariffs in the two poorest consumer categories unchanged. [S8] After the signing of the new contract, lengthy negotiations began with the assistance of external advisors brought in with the support of the Asian Development Bank about the so-called \"rate rebasing\" for the period 2002-2007. [S9] During the negotiations, two other tariff increases were approved in April 2003 and January 2004, again leaving tariffs for the poorest unchanged. [S10] For the first time since 1998, in 2003 average water tariffs became higher than water charges, standing at 5,000 and 4,000 Rupiahs per cubic meter respectively. [S11] In July 2004 the City Council approved an automatic tariff adjustment (ATA) every six months over a five-year period to allow the provincial government to pay its arrears to the private operators. [S12] The water tariff adjustment formula foresaw that increases of the water charge would be fully passed on to consumers, in addition to any changes in the financial requirements of the asset holding company PAM Jaya and the regulatory body. [S13] In 2004 a consumer group sued the concessionaires for providing poor services, based on a survey carried out by the Peoples Coalition for The Rights to Water (KRuHA). [S14] The lawyers of the utilities rejected the claims saying that the evidence presented was poor and that the survey to support the claims was not carried out by an independent agency. [S15] ### Exit of Thames Water and freeze of water tariffs and charges (2006-2009)\n\nIn January 2006 Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso and the City Council delayed a raise in water tariffs due to protests by city councillors. [S16] In the same year Suez Environnement reduced its share in the concession to 51 percent in a move that, according to the company, had been planned long before. [S17] The remaining shares were sold to PT Astratel Nusantara (30 percent), which is part of the Indonesian conglomerate Astra International, and Citigroup of the US (19 percent). [S18] Shortly afterwards Thames Water completely exited the Indonesian market by selling 95 percent of its share in TPJ to Acuatico, a consortium of Indonesia's ReCapital Advisors and Glendale Partners. [S19] While both mother companies of Acuatico had no operating experience in the water sector, Acuatico itself had provided water to commercial customers in Jakarta before.

The user is asking when the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body (JWSRB) was established and what its primary role was. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information. Let me scan through the sentences.\n\nLooking at the chunks, there's a section labeled \"Renegotiations (2001-2004) and establishment of a regulator\". That seems relevant. Specifically, sentence S3 mentions the establishment. Then, in S4, it says the agreement foresaw the creation of JWSRB as an independent regulator. \n\nSo, the establishment date would be when the \"Restated Cooperative Agreement\" was signed, which is October 2001. The primary role is supervising the concessions and reviewing tariff increases on behalf of the Governor and the Ministry of Public Works. Also, S6 mentions that the regulatory function was separated from the asset holding function to avoid conflict of interest. But the main role is in S4. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other info. The question is about establishment date and primary role. The answer should cite S3 and S4. Let me check if there are other sentences. S5 talks about PAM Jaya's role before, but that's not the regulator. S6 explains the separation of functions, which supports the role. But the primary role is directly stated in S4. \n\nSo the answer would be: Established in October 2001 (S3), primary role was supervising concessions and reviewing tariff increases (S4). Also, maybe mention the separation of functions from S6. But the user might want the main points. Let me structure the statements accordingly."

      "chunk": "Chunk:\n\n[S1] British and French executives and diplomats then convinced the central government to maintain the concessions, after the foreign companies separated themselves from their Indonesian partners tainted by their association with the former regime. [S2] The City Council, after having approved tariff increases of 15 percent in February 1998 despite the crisis, was soon faced with riots and froze the tariffs for the next three years. [S3] ### Renegotiations (2001-2004) and establishment of a regulator\n\nDue to the impact of the 1997 East Asian financial crisis the contracts were renegotiated through a \"Restated Cooperative Agreement\" signed in October 2001. [S4] The agreement also foresaw the creation of the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body (JWSRB) as an \"independent\" regulator in charge of supervising the concessions and reviewing requests for tariff increases on behalf of the Governor of Jakarta and the Ministry of Public Works. [S5] Initially, PAM Jaya had the responsibility to monitor the performance of the two private companies on behalf of the city government in addition to being an asset holding company. [S6] By creating the regulatory body the regulatory function was to be clearly separated from the asset holding function, thus avoiding a possible perception of a conflict of interest. [S7] In April 2001 the City Council approved a tariff increase of 35 percent, while leaving tariffs in the two poorest consumer categories unchanged. [S8] After the signing of the new contract, lengthy negotiations began with the assistance of external advisors brought in with the support of the Asian Development Bank about the so-called \"rate rebasing\" for the period 2002-2007. [S9] During the negotiations, two other tariff increases were approved in April 2003 and January 2004, again leaving tariffs for the poorest unchanged. [S10] For the first time since 1998, in 2003 average water tariffs became higher than water charges, standing at 5,000 and 4,000 Rupiahs per cubic meter respectively. [S11] In July 2004 the City Council approved an automatic tariff adjustment (ATA) every six months over a five-year period to allow the provincial government to pay its arrears to the private operators. [S12] The water tariff adjustment formula foresaw that increases of the water charge would be fully passed on to consumers, in addition to any changes in the financial requirements of the asset holding company PAM Jaya and the regulatory body. [S13] In 2004 a consumer group sued the concessionaires for providing poor services, based on a survey carried out by the Peoples Coalition for The Rights to Water (KRuHA). [S14] The lawyers of the utilities rejected the claims saying that the evidence presented was poor and that the survey to support the claims was not carried out by an independent agency. [S15] ### Exit of Thames Water and freeze of water tariffs and charges (2006-2009)\n\nIn January 2006 Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso and the City Council delayed a raise in water tariffs due to protests by city councillors. [S16] In the same year Suez Environnement reduced its share in the concession to 51 percent in a move that, according to the company, had been planned long before. [S17] The remaining shares were sold to PT Astratel Nusantara (30 percent), which is part of the Indonesian conglomerate Astra International, and Citigroup of the US (19 percent). [S18] Shortly afterwards Thames Water completely exited the Indonesian market by selling 95 percent of its share in TPJ to Acuatico, a consortium of Indonesia's ReCapital Advisors and Glendale Partners. [S19] While both mother companies of Acuatico had no operating experience in the water sector, Acuatico itself had provided water to commercial customers in Jakarta before. [S20] The new owners retained the management of TPJ, but the name of the TPJ was subsequently changed to PT Aetra Air Jakarta (**Aetra**).",

The user is asking in which year Thames Water exited the Indonesian market and to whom they sold their shares in TPJ.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context for any mentions of Thames Water's exit.

Also, [S15] mentions January 2006, which aligns with the exit happening in 2006. \n\nThe answer to the first part is 2006. For the second part, the buyers are Acuatico, which is a consortium of ReCapital Advisors and Glendale Partners. The citation here is [S18]. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention, but the rest of the context doesn't add more info on this.

[S17] The court also noted that the private operators were \"negligent in fulfilling the human right to water for Jakarta's residents.\" The government of Indonesia and the private operators lodged an appeal against the court decision.

[S2] It remains unclear what could have caused such a massive decline, and substantial increases and decreases in the BPS figures from one year to the other cast a shadow of doubt on the reliability of these figures. [S3] ### Access by the poor\n\nThe private companies have specifically attempted to improve the supply of clean drinking water to slum areas where house connections are difficult because residents do not own the land on which they live. [S4] However, these attempts have been fairly limited. [S5] For example, Palyja has installed so-called *Master Meters*, from which residents in communities can connect themselves with the assistance of NGOs such as Mercy Corps. [S6] As of 2012, however, there were only 3 Master Meters, one in Rawa Bebek and 2 in Jembatan Besi. [S7] The Master Meters provide cleaner water than water vendors at about half the costs to households, but the impact of the program is minimal because of its limited size. [S8] In addition, Palyja has built 47 water kiosks in or near slum areas where residents can obtain clean water. [S9] Piped connections were also expanded. [S10] One example is a project in Western Jakarta under which Palyja connected more than 5,000 poor households and was reimbursed through an *output-based aid* grant from the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid. [S11] As part of the project connection fees were reduced to USD 13, or less than one tenth of the usual fee. [S12] 75 percent of the subsidy was paid to PALYJA upon independent verification of the installation of a working connection and the remaining 25 percent after verification of three consecutive months of satisfactory service delivery. [S13] Another example is in Marunda where TPJ completely waived connection fees and even installed in-house connections for free for 1,600 households using a grant from Thames Water. [S14] It allowed the poorest households to pay the connection fee in 12 monthly instalments through the water bill. [S15] However, these efforts have been limited in part because there are disincentives to connect the poor even when they have a legal title to their land. [S16] These disincentives existed when the system was managed publicly and remain in place under private management: Revenues from poor customers are low, thus increasing the deficit of the entities in charge of service provision; the cost of connecting the poor in dense existing settlements is higher than connecting new middle-income settlements; and finally a \"mafia\" of water vendors and hydrant operators defends its monopoly of selling water to the poor at high prices, sometimes even through violent intimidation of customers, competing vendors, the police and city officials. [S17] ### Water sales\n\nThe concession contracts included contractual targets to increase the volume of water sold. [S18] Water sales did increase substantially without any increase in bulk water supply, but still not as much as foreseen in the contracts. [S19] In the western half, the volume increased from 89 million m\u00b3 per year in 1998 to 130 in 2007 and 153 in 2011. [S20] In the eastern half it increased from about 90 million m\u00b3 per year to more than 140 in 2004. [S21] However, it then declined to about 120 in 2007, far below the contractual target.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the decline in the share of households with access to an improved water source in DKI Jakarta from 1998 to 2010 according to SUSENAS surveys. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information. The passage starts with [S1], which mentions the SUSENAS surveys showing a decline from 59% in 1998 to 39% in 2008 and 28% in 2010. That seems to directly answer the question. \n\nI should check if there are any other sentences that might add more context or details. [S2] talks about the decline being unclear and the reliability of the figures being in question, but the actual numbers are in [S1]. The rest of the context discusses efforts to improve water access, like Master Meters and water kiosks, but those are probably not relevant to the specific question about the decline percentage.\n\nSo the answer should be the numbers from [S1]. The user wants the decline from 1998 to 2010, which is from 59% to 28%. The citation needed is [S1]. I need to make sure each sentence in the answer has the correct citations. Since the statement about the decline is in [S1], that's the only citation needed."

      "chunk": "Chunk:\n\n[S1] However, the annual national socio-economic surveys (SUSENAS) of the National Statistical Agency BPS for the Special Capital City District (DKI) of Jakarta show a decline in the share of households with access to an improved water source from 59 percent in 1998 to 39 percent in 2008 and 28 percent in 2010. [S2] It remains unclear what could have caused such a massive decline, and substantial increases and decreases in the BPS figures from one year to the other cast a shadow of doubt on the reliability of these figures. [S3] ### Access by the poor\n\nThe private companies have specifically attempted to improve the supply of clean drinking water to slum areas where house connections are difficult because residents do not own the land on which they live. [S4] However, these attempts have been fairly limited. [S5] For example, Palyja has installed so-called *Master Meters*, from which residents in communities can connect themselves with the assistance of NGOs such as Mercy Corps. [S6] As of 2012, however, there were only 3 Master Meters, one in Rawa Bebek and 2 in Jembatan Besi. [S7] The Master Meters provide cleaner water than water vendors at about half the costs to households, but the impact of the program is minimal because of its limited size. [S8] In addition, Palyja has built 47 water kiosks in or near slum areas where residents can obtain clean water. [S9] Piped connections were also expanded. [S10] One example is a project in Western Jakarta under which Palyja connected more than 5,000 poor households and was reimbursed through an *output-based aid* grant from the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid. [S11] As part of the project connection fees were reduced to USD 13, or less than one tenth of the usual fee. [S12] 75 percent of the subsidy was paid to PALYJA upon independent verification of the installation of a working connection and the remaining 25 percent after verification of three consecutive months of satisfactory service delivery. [S13] Another example is in Marunda where TPJ completely waived connection fees and even installed in-house connections for free for 1,600 households using a grant from Thames Water. [S14] It allowed the poorest households to pay the connection fee in 12 monthly instalments through the water bill. [S15] However, these efforts have been limited in part because there are disincentives to connect the poor even when they have a legal title to their land. [S16] These disincentives existed when the system was managed publicly and remain in place under private management: Revenues from poor customers are low, thus increasing the deficit of the entities in charge of service provision; the cost of connecting the poor in dense existing settlements is higher than connecting new middle-income settlements; and finally a \"mafia\" of water vendors and hydrant operators defends its monopoly of selling water to the poor at high prices, sometimes even through violent intimidation of customers, competing vendors, the police and city officials. [S17] ### Water sales\n\nThe concession contracts included contractual targets to increase the volume of water sold. [S18] Water sales did increase substantially without any increase in bulk water supply, but still not as much as foreseen in the contracts. [S19] In the western half, the volume increased from 89 million m\u00b3 per year in 1998 to 130 in 2007 and 153 in 2011. [S20] In the eastern half it increased from about 90 million m\u00b3 per year to more than 140 in 2004. [S21] However, it then declined to about 120 in 2007, far below the contractual target.

      "answer": "<statement>As of 2012, there were only 3 Master Meters installed by Palyja in Jakarta, located in Rawa Bebek and Jembatan Besi.<cite>[S6]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how many Master Meters Palyja installed in Jakarta as of 2012 and where they were located. \n\nFirst, I need to scan through the provided supporting context to find relevant information. The key terms here are \"Master Meters\" and \"Palyja\" and the year 2012. Let me go through each sentence.\n\nLooking at the sentences, [S5] mentions that Palyja installed Master Meters. Then [S6] says \"As of 2012, however, there were only 3 Master Meters, one in Rawa Bebek and 2 in Jembatan Besi.\" That seems to directly answer the question. \n\nSo the number is 3, with locations Rawa Bebek (1) and Jembatan Besi (2). I should check if there's any other mention of Master Meters elsewhere. Scanning through the rest, [S7] talks about the impact but doesn't add more numbers. The rest of the sentences discuss water kiosks, connections, etc., but not the Master Meters. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 3 Master Meters located in Rawa Bebek and Jembatan Besi. The citation is [S6]."

      "chunk": "Chunk:\n\n[S1] In the eastern half it increased from about 90 million m\u00b3 per year to more than 140 in 2004. [S2] However, it then declined to about 120 in 2007, far below the contractual target. [S3] ### Service quality\n\nAccording to a survey by the regulatory body in 2007, only 30 percent of those connected to the public water network enjoyed continuous water supply. [S4] On average, customers received water 12 hours per day. [S5] Tap water quality, at least in some areas and at some times, is poor: For example, residents of Cilincing, North Jakarta, have complained that their tap water has been cloudy for two months and blame skin irritation and diarrhoe on the poor water supply. [S6] According to interviews with residents in South and West Jakarta, shown in a 2011 video by the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, service quality has actually deteriorated since the concessions began. [S7] One of the reasons is that, because of low pressure, some customers pump directly from the pipes, therefore sucking dirty groundwater through leakages of the pipes. [S8] ### Water losses\n\nWater losses have been reduced, but much slower than foreseen in the concession contracts. [S9] In the eastern half, they have increased again between 2003 and 2007. [S10] According to Palyja, in its western half of the concession non-revenue water declined from 57 percent in 1998 to 47 percent in 2007 and 37 percent in 2012. [S11] According to data from the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body non-revenue water in the eastern half declined from 58 percent in 1998 to 44 percent in 2003, but then increased again to 52 percent. [S12] This compares unfavorably with the 2007 target of 34 percent. [S13] Water losses include illegal connections, some of which are used by the poor to serve their basic needs. [S14] ### Tariffs\n\n**Tariff increases**. [S15] Between 1998 and 2010 the water tariff increased threefold, from 375 to 1,050 Rupiahs (USD 0.04 to USD 0.12) per m\u00b3 in the lowest category and from 5,200 to 14,650 Rupiahs (USD 0.58 to USD 1.63) in the highest category. [S16] This far exceeded the growth of household income during the same period and thus increased the burden of water tariffs on all water consumers, including the poor. [S17] **Affordability**. [S18] According to a study by the Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia in 2008, the share of the water bill in the income of a poor family (tariff Category II) was 2.8 percent. [S19] According to Palyja, the corresponding figure for 2009 in its service area was only 1.6 percent. [S20] **Comparison with other cities**. [S21] At an average of USD 0.70/m\u00b3 water tariffs were higher than in other Indonesian cities in 2005. [S22] They were similar to those in Manila (USD 0.60/m\u00b3 and USD 0.71/m\u00b3 in East and West Manila respectively in 2008), higher than in Kuala Lumpur (USD 0.45/m\u00b3 in 2007), but lower than in Singapore (USD 1.22/m\u00b3 in 2012). [S23] ### Profitability\n\nThe concession contracts fixed a 22 percent annual rate of return for the private operators. [S24] The net profit of Palyja varied between Rp 58 million (9 percent of sales) in 2005 and Rp 137 million (15 percent of sales) in 2008. [S25] Palyja's financial statement for 2010 shows an even higher profit of Rp 216 billion (USD 25 million), and Aetra's 2010 profit was Rp 142 billion (USD 16 million). [S26] However, these profits are based on the assumption that the unpaid water charges billed to PAM Jaya will be fully paid to the operators. [S27] Actually, these charges are not being paid and writing off these unpaid bills, as it may become necessary, would significantly reduce the profits shown on the financial statements of the companies.

I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the relevant sentences.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of the eastern half and the years 2004 and 2007. Looking at the sentences:\n\n[S1] says that in the eastern half, the water supply increased from about 90 million m\u00b3 per year to more than 140 in 2004. So that's the start point in 2004.\n\nThen [S2] mentions that it then declined to about 120 in 2007. So from 2004 to 2007, it went from over 140 to 120. That's a decrease. \n\nAre there any other sentences that might be relevant? Let me check. [S9] talks about water losses increasing again between 2003 and 2007 in the eastern half, but that's about losses, not the supply volume. [S11] mentions non-revenue water in the eastern half declining then increasing, but again, not the actual supply volume. \n\nSo the key sentences are [S1] for 2004 and [S2] for 2007. The answer should state that the volume increased to over 140 in 2004 but then declined to 120 by 2007. The citations would be [S1] and [S2]. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other data. The question is specifically about the change from 2004 to 2007, so those two sentences are the main ones. The answer should be a statement citing those two."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how water tariffs in Jakarta compared to other cities in 2005 according to the text. I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of Jakarta's water tariffs and comparisons. The section labeled \"Tariffs\" seems important. Looking at the sentences under that section, there's a mention of tariff increases from 1998 to 2010. But the specific comparison to other cities is probably in the \"Comparison with other cities\" subsection. \n\nLooking at sentence [S21], it states: \"At an average of USD 0.70/m\u00b3 water tariffs were higher than in other Indonesian cities in 2005.\" Then sentence [S22] adds more details: \"They were similar to those in Manila (USD 0.60/m\u00b3 and USD 0.71/m\u00b3 in East and West Manila respectively in 2008), higher than in Kuala Lumpur (USD 0.45/m\u00b3 in 2007), but lower than in Singapore (USD 1.22/m\u00b3 in 2012).\" \n\nWait, the question is specifically about 2005. The text mentions 2005 in [S21] but the other cities' data is from different years. For example, Manila's data is from 2008, Kuala Lumpur from 2007, and Singapore from 2012. However, the question is about 2005, so maybe the comparison in [S21] is the key point. The text says that in 2005, Jakarta's tariffs were higher than other Indonesian cities. The other details in [S22] might be additional context but not directly relevant to 2005. \n\nSo the answer should focus on [S21] and possibly [S22] if the user is okay with the other cities' data even if not exactly 2005. But the question is about 2005, so the main citation is [S21]. However, the user might want the full comparison even if the dates differ. The answer needs to accurately reflect the text. \n\nTherefore, the statement would be that Jakarta's water tariffs in 2005 were higher than other Indonesian cities, with specific comparisons to Manila, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore, even though some data points are from different years. The citations would be [S21] and [S22]. But the user's question is about 2005, so maybe only [S21] is directly relevant. However, the text in [S22] mentions 2005 in the context of the comparison. Wait, no, [S21] says \"in 2005\" while [S22] has data from 2008, 2007, 2012. So the direct answer is [S21], but [S22] provides more context. However, the user might need to know that the comparison includes other cities even if the data isn't all from 2005. \n\nI think the correct approach is to cite [S21] for the 2005 comparison and [S22] for the specific cities' tariffs, even if the years differ. The question is about how Jakarta compared in 2005, so the main point is [S21], but the additional info in [S22] supports the comparison. So the answer should include both citations."
