      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for Wave Chow's full name and birth year. First, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the chunk given, the first sentence says: \"Wave Chow\" and then in parentheses \"(\u5468\u69ae\u4f73)(born 1975, Hong Kong)\". So the full name is probably \"\u5468\u69ae\u4f73\" which is the Chinese name, and the English name is Wave Chow. The birth year is 1975. \n\nI should check if there are any other mentions of his birth year elsewhere in the text. Scanning through the rest of the document, the other sentences talk about his career, qualifications, writings, etc., but nothing else about his birth year. The first mention seems to be the only one. \n\nSo the answer should state that his full name is Wave Chow (\u5468\u69ae\u4f73) and he was born in 1975. The citation would be [S1] because that's where the information is first mentioned. I need to make sure that the citations are correctly placed. The sentence in [S1] includes both the name and the birth year, so that's the correct citation."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking for Wave Chow's current position at AIA. I need to look through the supporting context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage. The first sentence mentions \"Premier Senior District Director of AIA.\" Then later, in sentence S3, it says \"Senior District Director.\" There's also a mention of \"Premier Senior District Director\" in S1. Wait, the user is asking for the current position. The passage says \"Today, as a Senior District Director...\" which might indicate his current role. But there's also \"Premier Senior District Director\" in S1. However, the exact wording in S1 is part of his name's description. Maybe the current position is Senior District Director. But I need to check if there's any more recent info. The passage doesn't mention any changes, so perhaps both titles are correct. But the question is about the current position. The sentence S3 says \"Today, as a Senior District Director...\" which suggests that's his current role. However, the initial mention in S1 says \"Premier Senior District Director.\" Maybe \"Premier\" is part of his title. But the exact answer would depend on the context. The user might need the most accurate citation. So the answer would be \"Senior District Director\" with citation S3. But also, the first sentence mentions \"Premier Senior District Director.\" So maybe both are correct. Wait, the question is about the current position. The passage states in S3 that he is \"a Senior District Director\" and mentions leading a team. The initial sentence might be his title, but the current role is stated in S3. So the answer should be Senior District Director, citing S3. But I need to check if there's any other sentences. The rest of the context talks about his career, writing, and honors. So the answer is Senior District Director, with citation [S3]. But also, the first sentence says \"Premier Senior District Director.\" Maybe the correct answer is \"Premier Senior District Director\" from S1. However, the wording in S1 is part of the introduction. The user might need to check if \"Premier\" is part of his current title. Since the passage doesn't specify that he has changed titles, both could be correct. But the question is about the current position. The sentence in S3 says \"Today, as a Senior District Director...\" which might imply that's his current role. However, the initial mention in S1 could be his title. Maybe the answer is \"Premier Senior District Director\" with citation S1. But I need to be precise. The passage starts with \"Wave Chow (\u5468\u69ae\u4f73)(born 1975, Hong Kong) is a Premier Senior District Director of AIA...\" So that's his title. Then in S3, it says \"Today, as a Senior District Director...\" Maybe \"Premier\" is part of his title, but the current position is Senior District Director. Or maybe \"Premier Senior District Director\" is the current title. The wording is a bit ambiguous. However, since S1 is the first sentence and introduces his title, and S3 refers to him as a Senior District Director, perhaps the answer is Senior District Director with S3. But the user might need to check both. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is \"Premier Senior District Director\" from S1. I think the answer is \"Premier Senior District Director\" as per S1, but the user should verify. However, the question is about the current position. If the passage doesn't mention any changes, then the initial title is still current. So the answer would be Premier Senior District Director, citing S1. But the sentence in S3 says \"Senior District Director,\" which might be a more recent title. This is a bit confusing. Maybe the correct approach is to include both citations if both are relevant. But the user's instructions say to provide citations for each sentence. So if the answer is \"Senior District Director\" from S3, then cite [S3]. Alternatively, if the title is \"Premier Senior District Director\" from S1, then cite [S1]. The passage might have both, but the exact answer depends on which is current. Since the passage doesn't specify that he has changed titles, the initial title in S1 is likely still current. However, the sentence in S3 uses \"Senior District Director,\" which might be a more specific role. Maybe \"Premier Senior District Director\" is the correct title, and S3 is part of his responsibilities. I think the safest answer is \"Premier Senior District Director\" with citation [S1], but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, the answer could be \"Senior District Director\" with [S3]. To resolve this, perhaps the answer is \"Senior District Director\" as per S3, since it's stated in the present tense. The first sentence might be a general description, but the current position is mentioned in S3. So I'll go with that."

The question is about what he's known as, so the key term here is \"Father of IANG.\" The answer should include that title and the citation from sentence 4.

I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the relevant sentences.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage. The user mentioned that each sentence is tagged with [S1], [S2], etc. So I'll go through each section.\n\nIn the \"Career\" section, sentence [S5] says: \"As a professional, he is keenly aware of the fundamental need to stay abreast of industry developments and global changes.\" That sounds directly related to staying updated. Then, sentence [S6] mentions he continues to diligently improve his qualifications. Also, [S7] lists the 15 professional qualifications he's obtained. \n\nSo the key points here are staying abreast of industry developments and global changes, and continuously improving qualifications. The question is about what he emphasizes. The answer should cite the sentences that mention these points. \n\nLooking at the sentences again, [S5] specifically talks about the need to stay updated. [S6] and [S7] talk about his actions to improve qualifications, which supports the emphasis. But the direct statement is in [S5]. So the citation would be [S5]. \n\nWait, the user wants the answer to include the citations. So the statement should be something like \"Wave Chow emphasizes the need to stay abreast of industry developments and global changes, as well as continuously improving qualifications.\" Then cite [S5][S6][S7]. But I need to check if those sentences are the ones that mention it. \n\nYes, [S5] is about staying abreast, [S6] says he continues to improve qualifications, and [S7] lists the qualifications. So those three sentences. But the question is specifically about \"staying updated,\" which is covered in [S5]. However, the answer might include the actions he takes, which are [S6] and [S7]. But the exact emphasis is in [S5]. \n\nSo the correct citation would be [S5]. But maybe the answer combines [S5] and [S6]. Let me check the exact wording. The question is \"what does Wave Chow emphasize about staying updated in his field?\" So the answer is that he emphasizes staying abreast of industry developments and global changes, and continuously improving qualifications. Therefore, the citations would be [S5] for the first part and [S6][S7] for the qualifications. But the user might expect only the direct mentions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe [S5] is the main one. The answer should be based on the exact sentences. So the answer sentence would be \"Wave Chow emphasizes the need to stay abreast of industry developments and global changes.\" Cited as [S5]. Then, if there's another sentence about improving qualifications, but the question is about staying updated, which is [S5]. However, the user might consider that improving qualifications is part of staying updated. But the exact answer is in [S5]. So I'll go with that."

      "question": "In which countries is Wave Chow's English-translated book sold?",
      "answer": "<statement>Wave Chow's English-translated book, \"Riding the Wave,\" is sold worldwide in Asia, the USA, Canada, Greece, Brazil, and India, in hardback and as an eBook.<cite>[S13]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking in which countries Wave Chow's English-translated book is sold. The supporting context provided has several sentences. I need to look through them to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan each sentence. Sentence S13 mentions that the first book, \"Riding the Wave,\" is sold worldwide in Asia, the USA, Canada, Greece, Brazil, and India, in hardback and as an eBook. That seems to directly answer the question. The other sentences talk about his career, writing, and honors, but not the countries where the book is sold. So the answer should be the countries listed in S13. I need to make sure there are no other sentences that mention other countries. Let me check again. No, the rest are about his qualifications, awards, and other books in Chinese. So the correct citation is S13."
