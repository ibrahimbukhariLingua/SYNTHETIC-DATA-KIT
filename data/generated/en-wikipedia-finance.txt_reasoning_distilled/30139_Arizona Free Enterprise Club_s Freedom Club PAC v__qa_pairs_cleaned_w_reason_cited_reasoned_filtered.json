  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this legal case in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by understanding the main points. The case is Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett, decided in 2011. The key issue was about Arizona's Clean Elections Act, which provided public financing to candidates who participated. If a participating candidate was outspent by a non-participating one, they got matching funds. The plaintiffs argued this violated the First Amendment by chilling speech, while supporters said it prevented corruption.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the matching funds were unconstitutional. They compared it to the Davis v. FEC case, where the Millionaire's Amendment was struck down. The Court said the Clean Elections Act imposed a greater burden because it automatically gave funds based on opponents' spending, even if the opponents weren't coordinated. This affected independent expenditures, which are protected. The main concept is that the law's matching funds provision was seen as a restriction on free speech by penalizing candidates who didn't use public funds.\n\nI should make sure to mention the key parties, the law in question, the Supreme Court's decision, the reasoning related to the First Amendment, and the comparison to Davis. Also, note the impact on independent expenditures. Need to keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Let me check if I missed any important details. The case timeline might not be necessary in the summary. Focus on the main topic: the constitutionality of matching funds under the First Amendment. Alright, time to put it all together.\n</think>\n\nIn *Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett* (2011), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5\u20134 that Arizona's Clean Elections Act, which provided public financing to candidates and matched funds when opponents outspent them, violated the First Amendment. The Court held that the law imposed an unconstitutional burden on free speech by penalizing candidates who chose not to participate in the public financing system, as it automatically triggered matching funds based on opponents' expenditures, including independent ones. The decision drew parallels to *Davis v. FEC* (2008), where a similar \"millionaire's amendment\" was struck down, but emphasized that Arizona's scheme was more restrictive by forcing independent groups to limit their speech to avoid triggering matching funds. The ruling underscored the Court's view that public financing mechanisms must not disproportionately chill political expression or create unequal treatment of candidates.",

[S3] Bennett\n\n\n\n***Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. [S4] Bennett***, 564 U.S. [S5] 721 (2011), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. [S6] ## Facts\n\nIn 1998, Arizona voters approved the ballot measure known as the Clean Elections Act. [S7] When it was passed, the Clean Elections law established public financing for candidates running for office. [S8] Candidates who choose to participate in the system must collect a specific number of five dollar donations. [S9] Under the law as passed, if a participating candidate is outspent by a non-participating opponent (including the opponent's expenditures of personal funds) the participating candidate receives government funds matching the money spent by the non-participating candidate, up to three times the original government subsidy. [S10] Independent expenditures by groups not coordinated with the candidate were also matched. [S11] ## Legal history\n\nThe plaintiffs filed a legal challenge against the Arizona Clean Elections Commission on August 21, 2008, in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. [S12] According to the Plaintiffs, the Clean Elections system produced a chilling effect on speech because it \"seeks to equalize funding.\" But advocates of the Clean Elections law argued that the system deters corruption because candidates do not have to cater to special interest groups. [S13] In January 2010 the district court decided the matching funds provision violated the First Amendment and issued an injunction. [S14] District Court Judge Roslyn Silver agreed with the plaintiffs that the matching funds provision could not stand under Davis, although she referred to the result as \"illogical\" and referred to the holding in *Davis* as \"an ipse dixit unsupported by the slightest veneer of reasoning to hide the obvious judicial fiat by which it is reached.\"\n\nSilver suspended her order while the Arizona Clean Elections Commission appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. [S15] The case was heard by the Ninth Circuit Court on April 12, 2010. [S16] The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the matching funds provision of Arizona's law was analytically distinct from the millionaire's amendment. [S17] Two years earlier the Supreme Court had decided, in *Davis v. [S18] Federal Election Commission* (2008), to strike down a provision of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) known as the Millionaire's Amendment that allowed candidates to raise campaign contributions at three times the normal contribution limit and receive unlimited coordinated party expenditures if their opponent spent over $350,000 of their own personal money. [S19] Writing for the Court in *Davis*, Justice Samuel Alito said the burden the Millionaire's Amendment imposed on candidates was impermissible because \"it attaches as a consequence of a statutorily imposed choice\". [S20] In other words, the statute imposed a burden on candidates who did not limit expenditures of their personal wealth to $350,000. [S21] The Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of *McComish*. [S22] (This case was consolidated with *Arizona Free Enterprise Club Freedom Club PAC v. [S23] Bennett* prior to consideration by the Supreme Court.) Oral arguments were heard March 28, 2011. [S24] On June 27, 2011, the Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling and declared matching funds schemes designed to \"level the playing field\" unconstitutional in a 5\u20134 decision.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the full name and citation of the case discussed in the text. First, I need to look through the supporting context provided.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the chunk, there's a line that says: \"Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. [S2] Bennett\". Then later, there's a bolded line: \"***Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. [S4] Bennett***, 564 U.S. [S5] 721 (2011), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" So the full name of the case seems to be \"Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett\". The citation is 564 U.S. 721 (2011). \n\nI should check if there are any other possible citations mentioned. The text also references \"Davis v. [S18] Federal Election Commission\" but that's another case. The main case here is the one about Arizona's Clean Elections Act. The key sentences are S4 and S5, but the full citation is in S5.

I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the passage. The user mentioned that each sentence is labeled with [S1], [S2], etc. So I'll check each of those sentences to find the answer.\n\nLooking at the sentences, [S7] says \"When it was passed, the Clean Elections law established public financing for candidates running for office.\" That's about public financing but not the specific requirement. Then [S8] states \"Candidates who choose to participate in the system must collect a specific number of five dollar donations.\" That sounds like a requirement. \n\nAnother part is [S9], which talks about matching funds if outspent, but that's more about what happens when they are outspent, not the initial requirement. The question is about what they had to meet to participate. So [S8] seems to be the key sentence here. \n\nI should check if there are other sentences that mention requirements. [S13] mentions advocates' arguments about deterring corruption, but that's not a requirement. [S14] talks about the court's decision, not the requirement. \n\nSo the main requirement is collecting five dollar donations as per [S8].

I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the sentences to find mentions of the Supreme Court's reasoning. Looking at the chunks, sentence S3 mentions that the Court found the Clean Elections Act imposed a heavier burden on candidate speech compared to the Millionaire's Amendment. It explains that candidates got public funds automatically when their opponent spent money, even for independent groups' expenditures. \n\nThen, sentence S6 talks about independent expenditures being protected since Buckley v. Valeo, and the Court found that the Clean Elections Act burdened groups making these expenditures by forcing them to choose between speaking on issues or candidates or triggering matching funds. \n\nSo the key issue seems to be that the Act placed a burden on protected independent expenditures by forcing groups to limit their speech. The Supreme Court's main point was about the unconstitutional burden on free speech, specifically regarding independent expenditures. \n\nI need to check if there are other sentences that might contribute. Sentence S7 mentions the Court's finding about the burden on independent expenditures.

      "question": "When did the Supreme Court agree to consider the formal appeal of the case?",
      "answer": "<statement>The Supreme Court agreed to consider the formal appeal of the case on November 29, 2010.<cite>[S26]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking when the Supreme Court agreed to consider the formal appeal of the case. I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the relevant sentence.\n\nLooking at the chunks, there's a section labeled \"Case timeline\". Let me go through each entry. \n\n[S25] says: \"August 17, 2010: Plaintiffs lawyers make formal appeal to the Supreme Court.\" So that's when the formal appeal was filed. But the question is about when the Supreme Court agreed to consider it. \n\nThen later in the same timeline, [S26] is November 29, 2010: \"Supreme Court agrees to consider formal appeal.\" That seems to directly answer the question. \n\nI should check if there are other mentions. [S27] mentions March 28, 2011, for oral arguments, and [S28] June 27, 2011, for the decision. But the key date here is November 29, 2010, when the Court agreed to consider the appeal. \n\nSo the answer should be November 29, 2010, cited from [S26]. Let me make sure there's no other conflicting info. The other dates are about the appeal being filed and the arguments, but the agreement to consider is specifically in [S26]."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the date set for oral arguments before the Supreme Court.
