      "chunk": "Chunk:\n\n[S1] Conning (company)\n\n\n# Conning (company)\n\n\n\n**Conning** is a global investment management firm serving the insurance industry. [S2] Conning supports institutional investors, including pension plans, with investment and asset management products, risk modeling software, and industry research. [S3] Founded in 1912, Conning has offices in Boston, Cologne, Hartford, Hong Kong, London, New York and Tokyo. [S4] ## Company history\n\nConning & Company was founded in Hartford, Connecticut in 1912 by William Smith Conning. [S5] Conning was born in Slingerlands, New York, just outside of Albany on September 16, 1877, and moved to Hartford in 1904 to serve as office manager for investment firm Hornblower & Weeks. [S6] He founded the firm together with William C. [S7] Goeben, a colleague of Conning's at Hornblower & Weeks. [S8] The firm embraced the technology of the day, providing election returns to clients by wire from New York during President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s t narrow, re-election victory in 1916 over Charles Evans Hughes. [S9] In 1920, Conning & Company installed a bond ticker and moved into a newly constructed building on Lewis Street in Hartford. [S10] In January 1923, Conning Realty Company was incorporated for $50,000 by Conning, Goeben, Mitchell and Charles T. [S11] Treadway. [S12] In 1935, a year shy of celebrating its 60th anniversary, the Hartford Stock Exchange closed after failing to comply with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the firm was no longer registered with the exchange. [S13] Two of the oldest investment firms in Hartford joined forces when Conning & Company merged with Ballard & Company on December 4, 1942, to become Conning & Company and Ballard. [S14] In late 1948, William S. [S15] Conning\u2019s wife, Carolyn Dermott Conning, died. [S16] Four months later, the widowed Conning died at the age of 71, leaving behind the couple\u2019s daughter, Katharine S. [S17] Conning, who died in 1996. [S18] ### Early activities\n\nIn 1950, Conning & Company began offering insurance stock research and advice to institutional investors. [S19] After Conning & Company celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1962, the firm continued to emphasize research and education. [S20] In 1968, the firm became a Registered Investment Advisor with the SEC. [S21] During 1970, the firm branched out into consulting and strategic industry research for senior insurance executives. [S22] By 1974, the firm had 13 Partners and 60 employees operating in Hartford with a subsidiary, Fox-Pitt Kelton Inc., headquartered in London. [S23] The subsidiary provided research on U.S. [S24] insurance companies and banks to institutional investors throughout Europe. [S25] ### Mergers and acquisitions (1985\u20131999)\n\nIn the mid- to late-1980s, the firm formed two new groups: a venture capital unit to raise private equity for insurance investments and an asset management group to manage insurance companies\u2019 assets. [S26] In 1995, Conning Corp. [S27] and its subsidiary Conning & Company. [S28] were acquired by General American Life Insurance Company (GALIC). [S29] Conning Corp.\u2019s asset management business was merged with General American Investment Management Company (GAIMCO) to form Conning Asset Management Company (now known as Conning, Inc.). [S30] In 1997, GALIC took Conning Corp. [S31] public and completed an initial public offering of 2.875 million shares in 1997. [S32] The company began trading on NASDAQ as CNNG. [S33] In August 1998, Conning Asset Management acquired Schroeder Mortgage Associates LP, a small real estate investment company in Manhattan. [S34] Four months later, Conning Corp. [S35] and Conning Asset Management acquired Noddings Investment Group, a small convertible bond asset manager and broker-dealer located near Chicago. [S36] Conning Corp. [S37] also acquired the insurance company and high-grade fixed income management business of TCW Group, based in Los Angeles. [S38] In 1999, Forbes ranked Conning Corp. [S39] 82nd on its list of 200 Best Small Companies. [S40] ### Expansion (2000\u20132003)",
      "question": "Who founded Conning and in which year?",
      "answer": "<statement>Conning was founded by William Smith Conning in 1912.<cite>[S4]</cite></statement> <statement>William Smith Conning founded the firm together with William C. Goeben.<cite>[S6]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking who founded Conning and in which year. So I need to look through the provided supporting context to find that information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of the founder. The chunk starts with \"Conning (company)\" and then there's a section about the company's history. Looking at the sentences, [S3] says \"Founded in 1912, Conning has offices in Boston...\" but it doesn't mention the founder's name here. Then, moving to [S4], which is \"Conning & Company was founded in Hartford, Connecticut in 1912 by William Smith Conning.\" That seems like the key sentence. \n\nFurther down, [S5] talks about William Smith Conning being born and moving to Hartford. [S6] mentions he founded the firm with William C. Goeben. Wait, so [S4] says he founded it, and [S6] says he founded it together with William C. Goeben. But the question is about who founded it. So the answer would be William Smith Conning, and the year is 1912. \n\nI need to check if there are other sentences that mention the founder. [S3] mentions the founding year but not the name. [S4] and [S5] and [S6] all refer to William Smith Conning as the founder. So the answer is William Smith Conning in 1912. The citations would be [S4] and maybe [S6] since it mentions he founded it with someone else. But the question is who founded it, so the primary citation is [S4], and [S6] might support that he was the founder. However, the exact answer is in [S4], so I should cite that. Also, [S5] gives more details about him, but the founding is in [S4]. \n\nSo the statement would be \"Conning was founded by William Smith Conning in 1912.\" The citations would be [S4] and possibly [S6] if needed. Wait, [S6] says \"He founded the firm together with William C. Goeben...\" So the founding was by both, but the primary name given in [S4] is William Smith Conning. So maybe the answer is William Smith Conning and William C. Goeben? But the question says \"who founded Conning\" \u2013 maybe it's both. However, the initial sentence in [S4] says \"founded in Hartford... by William Smith Conning.\" So perhaps the main founder is William Smith Conning, and [S6] adds that he founded it with William C. Goeben. So the answer should include both names? But the user might be looking for the primary founder. \n\nBut according to the text, [S4] states that Conning & Company was founded by William Smith Conning. Then [S6] says he founded the firm together with William C. Goeben. So the correct answer would be William Smith Conning and William C. Goeben. But the question is \"who founded Conning\" \u2013 maybe the answer is both. However, the user might expect the primary name. But according to the text, it's both. So I need to check the exact sentences. \n\nSo the answer should be William Smith Conning and William C. Goeben, with the year 1912. The citations would be [S4] and [S6]. But the user's question is \"Who founded Conning and in which year?\" So the answer is the two names and the year. But the initial sentence in [S4] says \"founded... by William Smith Conning,\" and [S6] says \"He founded the firm together with William C. Goeben.\" So the correct answer is both. Therefore, the statement should mention both names, citing [S4] and [S6]. \n\nBut maybe the user expects just the primary founder. However, the text explicitly mentions both. So I should include both. Therefore, the answer is William Smith Conning and William C. Goeben, founded in 1912. The citations would be [S4] and [S6]. Let me check the sentences again. \n\n[S4]: \"Conning & Company was founded in Hartford, Connecticut in 1912 by William Smith Conning.\"\n\n[S6]: \"He founded the firm together with William C. Goeben, a colleague of Conning's at Hornblower & Weeks.\"\n\nSo the answer is both. Therefore, the statement should be \"Conning was founded by William Smith Conning and William C. Goeben in 1912.\" Citations [S4] and [S6]. But the user might have intended only William Smith Conning. However, the text says \"together with,\" so both are correct. So I need to include both names."

Then, looking at sentence S2: \"Conning supports institutional investors, including pension plans, with investment and asset management products, risk modeling software, and industry research.\" That seems to list specific services. \n\nAre there other sentences that add more details? Let me check. S18 talks about early activities in 1950 when they began offering insurance stock research and advice. S21 mentions they became a Registered Investment Advisor. S22 says they branched out into consulting and strategic industry research. S23 mentions a subsidiary providing research on U.S. insurance companies and banks to European investors. \n\nBut the question is about services offered to institutional investors. The main services listed in S2 are investment and asset management products, risk modeling software, and industry research. The other sentences add more context but might not be directly answering the question. For example, S18 and S22 mention specific services like insurance stock research, consulting, and strategic research, but those might be part of the broader categories mentioned in S2. \n\nI should make sure to include all the services mentioned. However, the user might be looking for the direct answer from the passage. The answer should cite the sentences that explicitly state the services. So S2 is a key sentence. Also, S18 and S22 might be relevant. But the question is about what services they offer, so the main answer is in S2. Let me check if there are other sentences. \n\nLooking at the rest, S23 mentions the subsidiary provided research, which is part of industry research. S24 and S25 talk about that. But the main answer is in S2. So the answer should list the services from S2 and maybe other sentences if they add more. However, the user might want all the services mentioned. \n\nWait, the question is specifically about services to institutional investors. So S2, S18, S21, S22, S23, S24, S25. But need to check each. \n\nS2: investment and asset management products, risk modeling software, industry research.\n\nS18: insurance stock research and advice.\n\nS21: becoming a Registered Investment Advisor (which is a service).\n\nS22: consulting and strategic industry research.\n\nS23: subsidiary providing research on U.S. insurance companies and banks to institutional investors in Europe.\n\nSo maybe the answer should combine all these. But the user might want the most direct answer. The first mention is S2, which is the most comprehensive. The other sentences might be supporting details. However, the instructions say to provide citations for each sentence. So each service mentioned in different sentences should be cited. But how to structure the answer.\n\nThe user's answer should be in the format of statements with citations. So the answer would be a statement that lists the services, citing the relevant sentences. For example:\n\nConning offers investment and asset management products, risk modeling software, and industry research to institutional investors [S2]. Additionally, they provide insurance stock research and advice [S18], consulting and strategic industry research [S22], and have a subsidiary that offers research on U.S. insurance companies and banks [S23][S24][S25]. They are also a Registered Investment Advisor [S21].\n\nBut need to check if each of these is in the passage. Let me confirm:\n\n- S2: yes.\n- S18: yes, 1950 began offering insurance stock research and advice.\n- S22: 1970 branched into consulting and strategic industry research.\n- S23: subsidiary provided research on U.S. insurance companies and banks to European investors.\n- S21: became a Registered Investment Advisor in 1968.\n\nSo the answer should include all these points with their citations. However, the user might want the answer to be concise but accurate. The main answer is in S2, but other sentences add more details. So the final answer should list all the services mentioned, each with their respective citations."

      "answer": "<statement>The name of the merged company formed by Conning & Company and Ballard & Company was Conning & Company and Ballard.<cite>[S13]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the name of the merged company formed by Conning & Company and Ballard & Company. I need to look through the supporting context provided to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of a merger between Conning & Company and Ballard & Company. Let me go through each sentence. \n\nLooking at the sentences, I notice that sentence S13 mentions: \"Two of the oldest investment firms in Hartford joined forces when Conning & Company merged with Ballard & Company on December 4, 1942, to become Conning & Company and Ballard.\" Wait, that seems a bit redundant. The sentence says they merged to become \"Conning & Company and Ballard.\" But that might be a typo or a way of indicating the combined entity. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the merged company's name is just \"Conning & Company and Ballard,\" but that feels like just listing both companies. However, sometimes when companies merge, they might take a new name, but in this case, the sentence structure says they merged to become \"Conning & Company and Ballard.\" That might be the answer, but I need to check if there's another part of the context that clarifies it. \n\nLooking through the rest of the sentences, there's no other mention of the merged company's name. The next sentences talk about other events in 1948 and later. So based on the given context, the answer is likely \"Conning & Company and Ballard\" as per sentence S13. \n\nI should make sure there's no other citation. The question is straightforward, and the answer is directly in S13. So the citation would be [S13]."

[S5] Conning was born in Slingerlands, New York, just outside of Albany on September 16, 1877, and moved to Hartford in 1904 to serve as office manager for investment firm Hornblower & Weeks. [S6] He founded the firm together with William C. [S7] Goeben, a colleague of Conning's at Hornblower & Weeks.

Let me check the sentences under that section. \n\nSentence S26 talks about the mid- to late-1980s forming new groups, but that's before 1995. Then S27 mentions \"In 1995, Conning Corp. and its subsidiary Conning & Company. were acquired by General American Life Insurance Company (GALIC).\" Wait, so that's the acquisition.

But the actual acquisition here is Conning being bought by GALIC. The question is about Conning's acquisition, but maybe the answer is that they were acquired by GALIC in 1995. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other acquisitions mentioned in 1995. Let me check the rest. The next sentences talk about 1997 and 1998. So the only 1995 mention is S27 and S28. \n\nSo the answer is that Conning Corp. and its subsidiary were acquired by GALIC in 1995. The citations would be [S27][S28]. \n\nWait, but the question says \"acquisition did Conning make\", but according to the text, Conning was the one being acquired.

So the statement would be \"Conning Corp. and its subsidiary Conning & Company were acquired by General American Life Insurance Company (GALIC) in 1995.\" With citations [S27][S28]. \n\nI need to check if there's any other acquisition.

      "question": "In which year was Conning Corp. ranked 82nd on Forbes' list of 200 Best Small Companies?",
      "answer": "<statement>Conning Corp. was ranked 82nd on Forbes' list of 200 Best Small Companies in 1999.<cite>[S1][S2]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking in which year Conning Corp. was ranked 82nd on Forbes' list of 200 Best Small Companies. The supporting context provided has several sentences with citations.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context for any mention of Forbes' ranking. Let me scan each sentence. \n\nLooking at the first chunk: [S1] says \"In 1999, Forbes ranked Conning Corp.\" Then [S2] states \"82nd on its list of 200 Best Small Companies.\" So those two sentences together answer the question. The year mentioned here is 1999. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of the ranking in other sentences. The rest of the context talks about acquisitions and other events, but nothing else about Forbes. So the answer is 1999. The citations would be [S1] and [S2]. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says each sentence should have its own citations. So the statement about the year 1999 would be in [S1], and the 82nd rank in [S2]. But the question is asking for the year, so the answer is 1999, cited from [S1]. However, the user might need to have the answer in a statement that combines both sentences. But according to the response format, each sentence is a separate statement. \n\nBut the question is a single question, so the answer is the year 1999, which is in [S1]. However, [S2] also mentions the 82nd rank. But the question is about the year, so the correct citation is [S1]. Wait, but maybe the answer is in [S2], but [S2] doesn't have the year. Let me check again. \n\n[S1] says \"In 1999, Forbes ranked Conning Corp.\" [S2] says \"82nd on its list of 200 Best Small Companies.\" So the year is in [S1], and the rank is in [S2]. Therefore, the answer to the question is 1999, cited from [S1]. But the user might need to have both sentences as part of the answer. However, the question is specifically about the year. So the correct citation is [S1]. \n\nBut maybe the answer is presented as a statement that combines both sentences. For example, \"In 1999, Conning Corp. was ranked 82nd on Forbes' list...\" which would cite both [S1] and [S2]. But according to the instructions, each sentence is a separate statement. So if the answer is a single statement, it would need to reference both sentences. \n\nWait, the user's example shows that a sentence can have multiple citations. So if the answer is a single statement that includes both the year and the rank, then it would cite [S1] and [S2]. But the question is only asking for the year. However, the answer might need to reference the sentence where the year is mentioned. \n\nBut the user's instructions say to answer as accurately as possible. So the correct answer is 1999, and the citation is [S1]. However, the sentence [S2] also refers to the same event. But since the question is about the year, the citation should be [S1]. \n\nAlternatively, if the answer is presented as \"In 1999, Forbes ranked Conning Corp. 82nd on its list...\" then that would be a combination of [S1] and [S2], so the citation would be [S1][S2]. But the user's example shows that each sentence is separate. So maybe the answer should be split into two statements, but the question is a single question. \n\nHmm, the user's response format requires each sentence to be in <statement> tags. So if the answer is a single sentence, then it would be one statement. But the answer here is the year 1999, which is in [S1]. So the correct answer is 1999 with citation [S1]. However, the user might need to have the full context. Let me check the exact wording of the question again. \n\nThe question is \"In which year was Conning Corp. ranked 82nd on Forbes' list of 200 Best Small Companies?\" The answer is 1999, which is in [S1]. Therefore, the statement would be \"Conning Corp. was ranked 82nd on Forbes' list of 200 Best Small Companies in 1999.\" But the original sentences are [S1] and [S2]. So the answer would need to cite both sentences because the year is in [S1] and the rank is in [S2]. However, the question is only asking for the year. \n\nBut according to the instructions, each sentence in the answer must have citations. So if the answer is a single sentence that includes both the year and the rank, then it would cite both [S1] and [S2]. But if the answer is only the year, then it's [S1]. However, the answer needs to be accurate. Since the year is in [S1], the citation is [S1]. But maybe the answer should combine both sentences to provide the full context. \n\nI think the correct approach is to have a statement that includes both the year and the rank, citing both sentences. So the answer would be: \"Conning Corp. was ranked 82nd on Forbes' list of 200 Best Small Companies in 1999.\" with citations [S1][S2]. But the user's example shows that each sentence is separate. However, the question is a single question, so the answer is a single statement. Therefore, the correct answer is 1999, cited from [S1], but the full context requires both sentences. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is just the year, so the statement is \"The year is 1999.\" with citation [S1]. But the user might expect the full answer. \n\nI think the best way is to create a statement that states the year and the ranking, citing both sentences. So the answer would be:\n\n<statement>Conning Corp. was ranked 82nd on Forbes' list of 200 Best Small Companies in 1999.<cite>[S1][S2]</cite></statement>\n\nBut I need to check if that's allowed. The user's example shows that a sentence can have multiple citations. So this should be acceptable."

Looking at the chunks, there's a section labeled \"Expansion (2000\u20132003)\" which might have the necessary details. \n\nIn the chunk, sentence S12 mentions that in the first six months of 2003, the company spun out Schroeder Mortgage and Conning Capital Partners in MBOs. But that's about MBOs, not renaming. Then, looking further, sentence S13 says: \"Conning US then took over management of SR Asset Management's European third-party asset management businesses in Dublin and London.\" \n\nThen, sentence S14 states: \"Although Swiss Re continued to own the entities, they were renamed Conning Asset Management (Europe) Limited located in Dublin and Conning Asset Management Limited located in London.\" \n\nSo, the key part here is that the entities were renamed to Conning Asset Management (Europe) Limited in Dublin and Conning Asset Management Limited in London. The question is about the renamed entities of SR Asset Management's European businesses in 2003. The answer should be these two names. \n\nI need to check if these renamings happened in 2003. The context mentions that in 2003, Conning US took over the management, and then the entities were renamed. The exact year might be 2003. The citation for this would be S14. \n\nSo the answer should list the two renamed entities with the citation [S14]. Let me make sure there's no other information. The other sentences don't mention other renamings. Therefore, the answer is the two companies mentioned in S14."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking about a significant merger in 2004 involving Conning Corp. and Conning, Inc. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nLooking at the chunks, there's a section labeled \"### Expansion (2000\u20132003)\" and then later \"### New ownership (2009\u2013present)\". But the user is asking about 2004, which might be in the Expansion section. Let me check each sentence.\n\nLooking through the sentences, S14 mentions \"In 2004, Conning Corp. [S15] and Conning, Inc. [S16] merged with and into Conning & Company...\" So that seems to be the key sentence. The merger was between Conning Corp. and Conning, Inc. merging into Conning & Company. The citations here would be S15 and S16. \n\nI should make sure there's no other mention of a merger in 2004. The other sentences in 2004 also mention Conning & Company acquiring Conning Research & Consulting, but that's an acquisition, not a merger. The main merger is the one in S14. So the answer should be that Conning Corp. and Conning, Inc. merged with and into Conning & Company. The citation is [S14], but wait, the sentence itself has [S15] and [S16] as citations. Wait, looking at the original text:\n\n\"In 2004, Conning Corp. [S15] and Conning, Inc. [S16] merged with and into Conning & Company, leaving two entities: Conning & Company and Conning Asset Management Company which then changed its name to Conning, Inc. [S17]\"\n\nSo the sentence S14 is the one that mentions the merger. But the citations in that sentence are [S15][S16][S17]. Wait, the user's context has S14 as the sentence: \"In 2004, Conning Corp. [S15] and Conning, Inc. [S16] merged with and into Conning & Company, leaving two entities: Conning & Company and Conning Asset Management Company which then changed its name to Conning, Inc. [S17]\"\n\nSo the actual merger is mentioned in S14, and the citations for Conning Corp. and Conning, Inc. are S15 and S16, but the sentence S14 itself is the one that states the merger. However, the way the citations are structured, each sentence has its own citations. So the sentence S14 would have [S15][S16][S17], but the question is about the merger occurring in 2004. So the answer is that Conning Corp. and Conning, Inc. merged with and into Conning & Company. The citation for that statement would be [S14], but looking at the original context, the sentence S14 is the one that contains the information. However, the way the user provided the context, each sentence is labeled with [S1], [S2], etc. So the sentence that mentions the merger is S14, and within that sentence, there are references to S15, S16, and S17. But the actual event is in S14. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's supporting context is structured as:\n\nChunk:\n\n[S1] In 1999, Forbes ranked Conning Corp. [S2] 82nd on its list of 200 Best Small Companies. [S3] ### Expansion (2000\u20132003)\n\nIn 2000, MetLife acquired Conning Corp. [S4] and took it private, paying $12.50 a share in cash. [S5] Later that year, Conning acquired Charter Oak Asset Management of Hartford, and also spun out its MarketStance business in an MBO. [S6] Swiss Reinsurance Company acquired Conning Corp.

[S19] ### New ownership (2009\u2013present)\n\nSo the sentence that mentions the merger is S14. However, within that sentence, there are references to S15, S16, and S17. But the actual event (the merger) is described in S14. Therefore, the correct citation for the statement about the merger would be [S14]. However, the user's instruction says that each sentence is inside <statement> tags, and the citations are the ones linked to that sentence. So if the sentence is S14, then the citation is [S14]. But in the original text, the sentence S14 has [S15][S16][S17] as citations. Wait, no. Let me check the exact structure.\n\nLooking at the original context, the sentence \"In 2004, Conning Corp. [S15] and Conning, Inc. [S16] merged with and into Conning & Company, leaving two entities: Conning & Company and Conning Asset Management Company which then changed its name to Conning, Inc. [S17]\" is labeled as [S14]. So the sentence S14 includes the merger event, and within that sentence, the mentions of Conning Corp. and Conning, Inc. are cited as S15 and S16, and the part about the name change is S17. But the main event (the merger) is in S14. However, the user's instruction says that each sentence's citations are the ones linked to that sentence. So if the sentence is S14, then the citations would be [S15][S16][S17], but the actual event is in that sentence. But the question is asking for the merger, which is described in S14. Therefore, the answer should be that the merger is mentioned in S14, and the citations for that sentence are [S15][S16][S17]. However, the user might expect the answer to cite S14 as the source. But according to the format, each sentence's citations are the ones in that sentence. So the correct way is to have the statement about the merger in S14, with citations [S15][S16][S17]. But the user's question is asking for the significant merger, so the answer would be the sentence from S14, with those citations. Therefore, the answer should be:\n\n<statement>In 2004, Conning Corp. and Conning, Inc. merged with and into Conning & Company, leaving two entities: Conning & Company and Conning Asset Management Company which then changed its name to Conning, Inc.</statement><cite>[S15][S16][S17]</cite>\n\nBut I need to check if the user's format requires each sentence to be in <statement> tags with their own citations. So the answer would be a single statement citing those three sentences. However, the user's example shows that each sentence is a separate <statement> with its own citations. So in this case, the sentence that contains the merger information is S14, which includes the citations [S15][S16][S17]. Therefore, the correct answer is that statement with those citations."
