[S2] The latter includes: clothing, furniture, household items, electronics and electrical appliances. [S3] In Germany, Tchibo's slogan is \"Every week a new world\" (German: *Jede Woche eine neue Welt*). [S4] Tchibo has further expanded its product range to sell services such as travel, insurance, and mobile-phone contracts. [S5] With over 1,000 shops, Tchibo is one of Germany's largest retail chains. [S6] The company is headquartered in Hamburg. [S7] Tchibo's coffee is sold in supermarkets and other smaller stores in the United States, Canada, Czechia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Hungary, Ukraine, Syria, Jordan, ~~Russia~~, United Arab Emirates, Poland, Ireland, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Lebanon. [S8] It is also sold online. [S9] ## History\n\n\n### Founding\n\nTchibo was founded in 1949 in Hamburg by Max Herz and Carl Tchilinghiryan, and still maintains its headquarters in the north of the city. [S10] The name Tchibo is an abbreviation for Tchiling and *Bohnen* (coffee beans). [S11] During its formative years, Tchibo concentrated on a mail-order service of freshly roasted coffee beans, processed in the company's own roasting facility in the Hamburg district of Hoheluft. [S12] ### Expansion\n\nIn 1977, Tchibo purchased shares of Beiersdorf and in 1980 became the majority shareholder of the Hamburg cigarette producer Reemtsma. [S13] The Reemtsma stake was sold in 2002 to Imperial Tobacco for €5.2 billion. [S14] In 1986, they tried their luck in the video game console market and released the Tele-Fever home video game console. [S15] It sold only very few units. [S16] After buying its rival Eduscho in 1997, Tchibo became the market leader in Germany with 20%. [S17] In the 1990s, Tchibo began to expand to countries outside Germany and now has shops in Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, the Netherlands, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Turkey. [S18] Entry into the US market was planned in the early 2000s, but later cancelled. [S19] As of mid-2020 Tchibo operates a mail order business in the United States selling ground and whole-bean coffee as well as proprietary coffee makers. [S20] Tchibo sold the cigarette brand Davidoff to the UK-based company Imperial Tobacco for €540 million. [S21] in 2006; the rights for the brand *Davidoff café* remained with Tchibo. [S22] Tchibo has started distribution of its brand *Davidoff café* to the US. [S23] ### Reorganisation\n\nThe company presented a reorganisation programme to its employees at a staff meeting on 7 December 2007, with the aim of returning the business to growth by 2010.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ\n\nIn the UK, following a consultation period, Tchibo GB decided to close half of its retail stores and re-structure the head office and field teams. [S24] The UK board was reduced from 11 directors to 4. [S25] In November 2008, a Tchibo spokesman announced that the concessions in Somerfield and Sainsbury's supermarkets would close in 2009, blaming difficult macroeconomic conditions in Britain. [S26] Tchibo's lack of success in the British market was summarised by *Retail Week* as due to it being \"a glorified pound shop\". [S27] In early 2009, the company confirmed it would leave the UK market, by selling its leases. [S28] All of the Tchibo GB stores were closed by the end of October 2009. [S29] The UK online webstore followed on 1 September 2010. [S30] A \"new and improved\" Tchibo Online Shop was launched in the UK on 28 June 2016\n\nIn August 2016, Tchibo acquired Scotland based roasting company Matthew Algie. [S31] ## Corporate structure\n\nTchibo is owned by Maxingvest AG, which changed its name from Tchibo Holding AG in 2007. [S32] It is 100% owned by three members of the Herz family, Ingeburg Herz (Max Herz's widow), and two of her sons, Michael Herz and Wolfgang Herz. [S33] In 2003, they bought out their brother, Gunter, and sister, Daniela Herz-Schnoekel. [S34] Their brother Joachim died in a motorboat accident in 2008.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking what Tchibo is primarily known for. I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage. The first sentence mentions that Tchibo is a German chain of coffee retailers and cafés. Then it says they're known for their range of non-coffee products that change weekly. The next sentences list items like clothing, furniture, household items, electronics, etc. There's also mention of their slogan, expansion into services like travel and insurance, and their presence in various countries.\n\nBut the key part here is the first part. The question is about what they're primarily known for. The passage starts by stating they are a coffee retailer and café chain. Even though they have other products, the primary focus is on coffee. The non-coffee products are mentioned as part of their range, but the main identity is as a coffee retailer. Also, the slogan \"Every week a new world\" might relate to their product variety, but the core is coffee.\n\nLooking at the citations, the first sentence [S1] introduces Tchibo as a coffee retailer. The second sentence [S2] talks about non-coffee products. So the primary knowledge is in [S1]. Other sentences support additional info but the main answer is from [S1]. I should make sure there's no other sentence that contradicts this. The rest of the context talks about expansion, history, etc., but the primary focus is on coffee retailing."

So the correct citation is [S3]. \n\nThe answer should be the slogan in German, which is \"Jede Woche eine neue Welt,\" but the question asks for the slogan in Germany, which is presented in the sentence. The user might want the German version, but the question is phrased as \"What is Tchibo's slogan in Germany?\" so the answer is the German slogan. However, the exact wording in the passage is \"Every week a new world\" with the German translation. But the user might expect the German slogan. Wait, the question is asking for the slogan in Germany, which would be the German one. But the passage says the slogan is \"Every week a new world\" (German: *Jede Woche eine neue Welt*). So the answer is \"Jede Woche eine neue Welt\" but the sentence mentions both. However, the user might want the exact slogan as used in Germany, which is the German phrase. But the question is in English, so maybe they want the English translation? Wait, the question is \"What is Tchibo's slogan in Germany?\" So the answer is the German slogan, but the passage provides both. Let me check the exact wording again. The sentence says: \"In Germany, Tchibo's slogan is 'Every week a new world' (German: *Jede Woche eine neue Welt*).\" So the slogan is \"Every week a new world,\" but the German version is *Jede Woche eine neue Welt*. However, the question is about the slogan in Germany, which would be the German one. But the way the sentence is structured, the slogan is presented in English with the German translation. But maybe the actual slogan is the German one. However, the passage states the slogan as \"Every week a new world\" with the German translation. So the answer should be \"Every week a new world\" with the citation [S3]. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the German version. But the question is in English, so perhaps the English translation is acceptable. But the correct approach is to quote exactly what's in the passage. The passage says the slogan is \"Every week a new world\" (German: *Jede Woche eine neue Welt*). So the answer is \"Every week a new world,\" but the user might need the German version. However, the question is asking for the slogan in Germany, which would be the German one. But the passage presents both. Hmm. The user might want the German slogan. But the way the sentence is written, the slogan is given in English with the German translation. So the answer is \"Every week a new world\" (German: *Jede Woche eine neue Welt*). But the user's question is straightforward. Since the passage directly states that, the answer is that sentence. So the correct citation is [S3]."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking how many shops Tchibo operates. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nLooking at the sentences, sentence S5 says: \"With over 1,000 shops, Tchibo is one of Germany's largest retail chains.\" That seems like the direct answer. The number mentioned is over 1,000. But I should check if there's any other sentence that might have a more specific number or any other details. \n\nOther sentences mention expansion to various countries, like Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, etc., but none of them specify the exact number of shops. The rest of the context talks about history, acquisitions, product ranges, and some closures in the UK, but not the total number of shops. \n\nSo the only explicit number is in S5. The answer should be that Tchibo operates over 1,000 shops, cited from S5. I don't see any other citations that mention the number of shops. The user might be looking for the exact number, but the context only states \"over 1,000,\" so that's the info to use."

[S7] Tchibo's coffee is sold in supermarkets and other smaller stores in the United States, Canada, Czechia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Hungary, Ukraine, Syria, Jordan, ~~Russia~~, United Arab Emirates, Poland, Ireland, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Lebanon. [S8] It is also sold online. [S9] ## History\n\n\n### Founding\n\nTchibo was founded in 1949 in Hamburg by Max Herz and Carl Tchilinghiryan, and still maintains its headquarters in the north of the city. [S10] The name Tchibo is an abbreviation for Tchiling and *Bohnen* (coffee beans). [S11] During its formative years, Tchibo concentrated on a mail-order service of freshly roasted coffee beans, processed in the company's own roasting facility in the Hamburg district of Hoheluft. [S12] ### Expansion\n\nIn 1977, Tchibo purchased shares of Beiersdorf and in 1980 became the majority shareholder of the Hamburg cigarette producer Reemtsma. [S13] The Reemtsma stake was sold in 2002 to Imperial Tobacco for €5.2 billion. [S14] In 1986, they tried their luck in the video game console market and released the Tele-Fever home video game console. [S15] It sold only very few units. [S16] After buying its rival Eduscho in 1997, Tchibo became the market leader in Germany with 20%. [S17] In the 1990s, Tchibo began to expand to countries outside Germany and now has shops in Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, the Netherlands, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Turkey. [S18] Entry into the US market was planned in the early 2000s, but later cancelled. [S19] As of mid-2020 Tchibo operates a mail order business in the United States selling ground and whole-bean coffee as well as proprietary coffee makers. [S20] Tchibo sold the cigarette brand Davidoff to the UK-based company Imperial Tobacco for €540 million. [S21] in 2006; the rights for the brand *Davidoff café* remained with Tchibo. [S22] Tchibo has started distribution of its brand *Davidoff café* to the US. [S23] ### Reorganisation\n\nThe company presented a reorganisation programme to its employees at a staff meeting on 7 December 2007, with the aim of returning the business to growth by 2010.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ\n\nIn the UK, following a consultation period, Tchibo GB decided to close half of its retail stores and re-structure the head office and field teams. [S24] The UK board was reduced from 11 directors to 4. [S25] In November 2008, a Tchibo spokesman announced that the concessions in Somerfield and Sainsbury's supermarkets would close in 2009, blaming difficult macroeconomic conditions in Britain. [S26] Tchibo's lack of success in the British market was summarised by *Retail Week* as due to it being \"a glorified pound shop\". [S27] In early 2009, the company confirmed it would leave the UK market, by selling its leases. [S28] All of the Tchibo GB stores were closed by the end of October 2009. [S29] The UK online webstore followed on 1 September 2010. [S30] A \"new and improved\" Tchibo Online Shop was launched in the UK on 28 June 2016\n\nIn August 2016, Tchibo acquired Scotland based roasting company Matthew Algie. [S31] ## Corporate structure\n\nTchibo is owned by Maxingvest AG, which changed its name from Tchibo Holding AG in 2007. [S32] It is 100% owned by three members of the Herz family, Ingeburg Herz (Max Herz's widow), and two of her sons, Michael Herz and Wolfgang Herz. [S33] In 2003, they bought out their brother, Gunter, and sister, Daniela Herz-Schnoekel. [S34] Their brother Joachim died in a motorboat accident in 2008.",

      "thinking": "Okay, so the question is \"Who currently owns Tchibo?\" Let me look through the supporting context provided.\n\nThe passage mentions under the \"Corporate structure\" section: \"Tchibo is owned by Maxingvest AG, which changed its name from Tchibo Holding AG in 2007.\" Then it says, \"It is 100% owned by three members of the Herz family, Ingeburg Herz (Max Herz's widow), and two of her sons, Michael Herz and Wolfgang Herz.\" There's also a note about buying out their brother Gunter and sister Daniela in 2003, and their brother Joachim's death in 2008. \n\nSo the current owners are the three family members. The citation here is [S32] and [S33]. I need to make sure there's no other information that might contradict this. The rest of the context talks about the company's history, expansions, and other acquisitions, but nothing about current ownership beyond that. So the answer should be the Herz family members mentioned."
