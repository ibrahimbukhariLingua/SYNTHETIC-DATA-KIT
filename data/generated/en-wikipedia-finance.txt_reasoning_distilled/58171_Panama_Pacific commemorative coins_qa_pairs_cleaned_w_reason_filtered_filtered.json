  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Panama–Pacific commemorative coins in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the document to understand the main points.\n\nThe document talks about the five commemorative coins issued in 1915 for the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco.

Legislation was passed, and artists like Aitken and Keck designed the coins, though some designs were rejected by the Treasury Secretary. \n\nThe production details mention the use of a private company for hubs, the challenges with the San Francisco Mint's facilities, and the distribution through Farran Zerbe, who had trouble selling them. The coins had low mintage, especially the round $50, and are now valuable, with some selling for hundreds of thousands. \n\nKey concepts: commemorative coins for the exposition, unique $50 pieces, design controversies, low mintage, historical significance, and their current value. I need to condense this into a concise summary focusing on the main topic and key points without getting too detailed.

Designed by artists like Robert Aitken and Charles Keck, the coins faced design rejections and production challenges, leading to low mintage numbers, particularly for the round $50 piece, which became one of the rarest commemorative coins. Despite poor initial sales, they hold significant numismatic value today, with some pieces fetching up to $200,000, and they reflect both the era's artistic ambitions and the historical context of the Panama Canal's completion.",

      "chunk": "[S1] Panama–Pacific commemorative coins\n\n\n# Panama–Pacific commemorative coins\n\n\n\nThe five **Panama–Pacific commemorative coins** were produced in connection with the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. [S2] Struck at that city's mint, the issue included round and octagonal $50 pieces. [S3] Excepting modern bullion coins, these two gold pieces are the highest denomination ever issued and the largest coins ever struck by the United States Mint. [S4] The octagonal $50 piece is the only U.S. [S5] coin to be issued that is not round. [S6] In January 1915, Congress passed legislation for a silver half dollar, as well as a gold dollar, quarter eagle ($2.50 piece), and two $50 pieces: one round and one octagonal. [S7] The Mint had already consulted artists. [S8] Treasury Secretary William G. [S9] McAdoo initially rejected all their designs. [S10] Two of them, Robert Ingersoll Aitken for the $50 pieces and Charles Keck for the gold dollar, persevered, and their submissions were used. [S11] The half dollar and quarter eagle were designed by Chief Engraver Charles E. [S12] Barber, possibly with the participation of his longtime assistant, George T. [S13] Morgan. [S14] The coins were vended at the Exposition by prominent numismatist Farran Zerbe. [S15] They did not sell well, and many of each denomination were returned for melting. [S16] Only a few hundred of each of the $50 pieces were distributed, making them the lowest-mintage commemorative coins. [S17] They catalog for up to $200,000, depending on condition. [S18] ## Background\n\nPrivate gold pieces, sometimes dubbed \"pioneer gold\", were struck several times during the 19th century from locally produced bullion in areas where federal coins were scarce. [S19] These unofficial coins came from sites ranging from Georgia to Oregon. [S20] Many, ranging in denomination from 25 cents to 50 dollars, are relics of the California Gold Rush and its aftermath. [S21] The fifty-dollar denomination was struck by private minters such as Kellogg and Co. [S22] The private $50 pieces were round in form, but those struck by Augustus Humbert for the U.S. [S23] Assay Office at San Francisco, prior to the establishment of the San Francisco Mint in 1854, were octagonal. [S24] Humbert's pieces were not money in a legal sense, as Congress had not authorized them as legal tender, and were officially deemed ingots. [S25] Nevertheless, they contained their full value in gold. [S26] Bearing the denomination \"Fifty Dollars\", they were called \"slugs\" or \"quintuple eagles\" by the public. [S27] They circulated widely in California and elsewhere in the Far West, and were accepted on par with federal gold coins. [S28] All of these $50 pieces, public or private, are very rare and valuable today: One of Humbert's octagonal pieces, dated 1851 and with a lettered edge, sold at auction in 2010 for $546,250. [S29] The only $50 piece produced by the United States Bureau of the Mint prior to 1915 was the 1877 pattern half union, produced experimentally at the Philadelphia Mint, though it was not approved as a circulating coin. [S30] In 1904, San Francisco merchant Rueben Hale proposed an exposition in his home city for 1915, both to commemorate the opening of the Panama Canal and to mark the 400th anniversary of Vasco Núñez de Balboa becoming the first European known to view the Pacific Ocean from the Americas: in phrasing then current, he discovered the Pacific. [S31] Although the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire caused a momentary setback to these plans, it actually sparked additional fundraising. [S32] Many of the wealthiest in California gave financial support, the state matched private donations dollar for dollar, and in 1911, President William Howard Taft selected San Francisco over its competitor, New Orleans, to host the fair.",

Wait, the actual text in the chunk is:\n\n[S4] The octagonal $50 piece is the only U.S. [S5] coin to be issued that is not round.\n\nSo perhaps there's a formatting error. Maybe S4 is \"The octagonal $50 piece is the only U.S.\" and S5 is \"coin to be issued that is not round.\" But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the original text had a line break, and the numbering is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the user intended that S4 and S5 are part of the same sentence. But according to the given data, each sentence is numbered. So perhaps the correct sentences are S4 and S5. However, the way it's written, S4 is \"The octagonal $50 piece is the only U.S. [S5] coin...\" which might be a typo.

Let me check other sentences.\n\nLooking at the rest of the context, there's also S3 which mentions that the octagonal $50 piece is the highest denomination and largest coins.

However, the user's context might have a formatting error. Alternatively, maybe the answer is in S5. Let me check again.\n\nThe exact text in the chunk:\n\n[S4] The octagonal $50 piece is the only U.S. [S5] coin to be issued that is not round.\n\nSo perhaps the actual sentence is S4: \"The octagonal $50 piece is the only U.S.\" and S5 is \"coin to be issued that is not round.\" But that would split the sentence. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake and the correct sentence is S5. Alternatively, maybe the user intended that S4 and S5 are part of the same sentence. But according to the given data, each sentence is numbered. So perhaps the answer is S5, but the sentence is \"coin to be issued that is not round.\" But that's incomplete. This is confusing.

Given that, I'll proceed with S5 as the citation. Also, looking at other parts, S3 mentions that the two gold pieces are the highest denomination and largest, but the uniqueness here is the octagonal shape. So the answer is that it's the only non-round U.S. coin. Therefore, the relevant sentence is S5. But the way it's written, maybe S4 and S5 are separate. However, given the context, I think the answer is S5. So the statement would be \"The octagonal $50 piece is the only U.S. coin to be issued that is not round.\" with citation [S5]. But I need to check if there's another sentence. Also, looking at S3: \"Excepting modern bullion coins, these two gold pieces are the highest denomination ever issued and the largest coins ever struck by the United States Mint.\" But that's about denomination and size, not shape. So the unique aspect is the shape. Therefore, the answer is based on S5. However, the original text might have a formatting error. Alternatively, maybe the correct sentence is S4. But given the way it's written, I'll go with S5."

[S3] The octagonal pieces were intended to recall the unofficial $50 coins struck during the Gold Rush\n\nMartine's bill passed the Senate on August 3, having been approved by the Committee on Industrial Expositions, to which it had been referred. [S4] The only objection was procedural, by Utah's Reed Smoot: that the bill should have instead been referred to and approved by the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, or its Committee on Finance. [S5] Neither Smoot nor any other senator objected to the bill itself, which Martine indicated had the support of Treasury Secretary William G. [S6] McAdoo. [S7] S. [S8] 6309 was the following day sent to the House of Representatives, where it was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures. [S9] It emerged from that committee on September 1, 1914, with several amendments, one of which increased the combined authorized mintage of the two $50 pieces from 2,000 to 3,000. [S10] S. [S11] 6309 was briefly considered by the House of Representatives on January 4, 1915, and passed after Kahn successfully proposed a minor amendment to strike out the dollar sign from the phrase \"silver coins of the denomination of $50 cents each\". [S12] The Senate concurred in the House amendments two days later, passing the bill without question, change, or opposition, and President Woodrow Wilson signed it into law on January 16. [S13] ## Preparation\n\nOnce Kahn's bill was introduced in the House, Mint Director George E. [S14] Roberts began to make informal arrangements to prepare for the commemorative issue. [S15] The bill called for four different designs (the two $50 pieces would differ mainly in shape), plus a commemorative medal to be sold to fairgoers, with an award medal to be given to prizewinning exhibitors. [S16] All of these pieces were to be struck by the Bureau of the Mint, and Roberts asked the Commission of Fine Arts to recommend artists. [S17] Among those recommended were Adolph A. [S18] Weinman (who would design the Mercury dime and Walking Liberty half dollar in 1916), and Bela L. [S19] Pratt (creator of the 1908 Indian Head gold pieces). [S20] Others included sculptors Evelyn Beatrice Longman, Robert I. [S21] Aitken, Charles Keck, and Paul Manship. [S22] Roberts wrote to several of the sculptors, and found Aitken interested in creating the $50 pieces. [S23] The Mint Director's tentative negotiations with Aitken for the large gold coins and with Buffalo nickel designer James Earl Fraser for the award medal ended when Roberts resigned in November to take a banking job; McAdoo appointed Dr. [S24] Frederic Dewey as Acting Director of the Mint. [S25] Dewey and McAdoo did little regarding the Panama–Pacific coins until Congress began to pass the authorizing legislation in early January 1915. [S26] Once it had passed both houses, and was awaiting Wilson's signature, Dewey arranged for a meeting in New York with Aitken, Keck, Longman, and Manship. [S27] The authorizing act required the Mint to begin delivering coins by the opening date of the fair, February 20, 1915, and although this proved impractical, the Mint still acted quickly. [S28] McAdoo approved the choices of Aitken for the $50 pieces, Longman for the quarter eagle, Keck for the dollar, and Manship for the half dollar on January 21.

The denominations are in S2: $50, $2.50, gold dollar, half dollar. The designs part is in S15, which mentions four different designs, with the two $50 pieces differing in shape. Also, the commemorative medal and award medal are part of the designs. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions. Let me check other sentences. S15 is the main one about designs.

Then another statement about the designs: The bill called for four different designs (the two $50 pieces would differ mainly in shape), plus a commemorative medal to be sold to fairgoers, with an award medal to be given to prizewinning exhibitors. [S15]. \n\nWait, but the question is about both denominations and designs. So the answer should include both parts. Let me check if there's a sentence that combines both. The original S2 mentions denominations, and S15 mentions designs. So two separate statements with their respective citations."

      "chunk": "[S1] Martine on July 6. [S2] This bill called for two $50 pieces (one round, one octagonal), a quarter eagle or $2.50 in gold, a commemorative gold dollar, and a half dollar. [S3] The octagonal pieces were intended to recall the unofficial $50 coins struck during the Gold Rush\n\nMartine's bill passed the Senate on August 3, having been approved by the Committee on Industrial Expositions, to which it had been referred. [S4] The only objection was procedural, by Utah's Reed Smoot: that the bill should have instead been referred to and approved by the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, or its Committee on Finance. [S5] Neither Smoot nor any other senator objected to the bill itself, which Martine indicated had the support of Treasury Secretary William G. [S6] McAdoo. [S7] S. [S8] 6309 was the following day sent to the House of Representatives, where it was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures. [S9] It emerged from that committee on September 1, 1914, with several amendments, one of which increased the combined authorized mintage of the two $50 pieces from 2,000 to 3,000. [S10] S. [S11] 6309 was briefly considered by the House of Representatives on January 4, 1915, and passed after Kahn successfully proposed a minor amendment to strike out the dollar sign from the phrase \"silver coins of the denomination of $50 cents each\". [S12] The Senate concurred in the House amendments two days later, passing the bill without question, change, or opposition, and President Woodrow Wilson signed it into law on January 16. [S13] ## Preparation\n\nOnce Kahn's bill was introduced in the House, Mint Director George E. [S14] Roberts began to make informal arrangements to prepare for the commemorative issue. [S15] The bill called for four different designs (the two $50 pieces would differ mainly in shape), plus a commemorative medal to be sold to fairgoers, with an award medal to be given to prizewinning exhibitors. [S16] All of these pieces were to be struck by the Bureau of the Mint, and Roberts asked the Commission of Fine Arts to recommend artists. [S17] Among those recommended were Adolph A. [S18] Weinman (who would design the Mercury dime and Walking Liberty half dollar in 1916), and Bela L. [S19] Pratt (creator of the 1908 Indian Head gold pieces). [S20] Others included sculptors Evelyn Beatrice Longman, Robert I. [S21] Aitken, Charles Keck, and Paul Manship. [S22] Roberts wrote to several of the sculptors, and found Aitken interested in creating the $50 pieces. [S23] The Mint Director's tentative negotiations with Aitken for the large gold coins and with Buffalo nickel designer James Earl Fraser for the award medal ended when Roberts resigned in November to take a banking job; McAdoo appointed Dr. [S24] Frederic Dewey as Acting Director of the Mint. [S25] Dewey and McAdoo did little regarding the Panama–Pacific coins until Congress began to pass the authorizing legislation in early January 1915. [S26] Once it had passed both houses, and was awaiting Wilson's signature, Dewey arranged for a meeting in New York with Aitken, Keck, Longman, and Manship. [S27] The authorizing act required the Mint to begin delivering coins by the opening date of the fair, February 20, 1915, and although this proved impractical, the Mint still acted quickly. [S28] McAdoo approved the choices of Aitken for the $50 pieces, Longman for the quarter eagle, Keck for the dollar, and Manship for the half dollar on January 21. [S29] All four artists were already at work, and Aitken responded to the notification of his hiring by submitting designs, which were similar to the actual coins.",
      "question": "Why were the octagonal $50 pieces included in the bill?",
      "answer": "<statement>The octagonal $50 pieces were included in the bill to recall the unofficial $50 coins struck during the Gold Rush.<cite>[S3]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking why the octagonal $50 pieces were included in the bill. I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the chunks, S2 mentions that the bill called for two $50 pieces, one round and one octagonal. Then S3 says the octagonal pieces were intended to recall the unofficial $50 coins struck during the Gold Rush. That seems like the key point here. The answer would be that they were included to recall the unofficial coins from the Gold Rush. \n\nI should check if there are other sentences that might add more context. S4 to S12 talk about the bill passing, objections, and amendments, but nothing about the reason for the octagonal shape. The rest of the chunks discuss the design process, artists, and minting, but not the reason for the octagonal shape. So S3 is the main citation here. \n\nSo the answer should state that the octagonal $50 pieces were included to recall the unofficial $50 coins from the Gold Rush, citing S3."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking who approved the choices of the artists for the coin designs and when. So, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the sentences. Sentence S2 mentions \"McAdoo approved the choices of Aitken for the $50 pieces, Longman for the quarter eagle, Keck for the dollar, and Manship for the half dollar on January 21.\" That seems directly relevant. The name here is McAdoo, and the date is January 21. \n\nBut I should check if there's any other information. Looking through other sentences, S8 talks about rejections sent on February 5, but that's about rejections, not approvals. S17 and S18 mention approvals on March 6 and March 8, but those are for the $50 and $1 pieces, and the half dollar. However, the question is about the initial approval of the artists' choices, not the final approval of the coins. \n\nSo the key sentence is S2. The date is January 21, and the person is McAdoo. The other sentences mention other approvals later, but the question is specifically about who approved the artists' choices. So the answer should be McAdoo on January 21. I need to make sure there's no other citation. The user wants the citation numbers in brackets. So the answer would be McAdoo approved the choices on January 21, citing S2."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking which artist's design was selected for the half dollar despite rejections. So I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the sentences. Let's start from the beginning. Sentence S2 mentions McAdoo approved choices for different coins, including Manship for the half dollar. But then later, sentence S8 says rejections to all four outside artists were sent on February 5. Then sentence S11 says Manship's objections were to no avail; McAdoo selected the design submitted by Barber for the half dollar. Wait, so even though Manship was initially chosen (S2), later Barber's design was selected instead. But why? Because the rejections in S8 were to the outside artists, which might include Manship. Then S11 says McAdoo picked Barber's design for the half dollar. So the answer is Barber? But the question says \"despite rejections.\" So maybe the original artist was rejected, and Barber's was chosen instead. \n\nLooking at S7: McAdoo had asked the Mint to prepare alternative designs, and Barber did so starting with the half dollar. Then S8 says rejections were sent to the four outside artists. So maybe the original artists (like Manship) were rejected, and Barber's design was selected. So the answer is Barber. But the question is about the artist whose design was selected despite rejections. So the answer is Barber's design was chosen even though the original artists (like Manship) were rejected. \n\nBut let me check again. In S2, Manship was approved for the half dollar. But then in S8, rejections were sent to all four outside artists. Then S11 says McAdoo selected Barber's design for the half dollar. So even though Manship was initially chosen, his design was rejected, and Barber's was selected instead. Therefore, the answer is Barber. But the question is phrased as \"despite rejections\"—so the design that was selected even though there were rejections. So the artist is Barber. \n\nBut wait, the rejections were to the outside artists. So maybe the original artists (Aitken, Longman, Keck, Manship) were rejected, and then Barber's design was chosen. So the answer is Barber. The sentence that states this is S11: \"McAdoo selected the design submitted by Barber for the half dollar.\" So the artist is Barber. Therefore, the answer should be Barber, with citation S11. But let me check if there's any other sentences. Also, S14 says Barber was selected for the quarter eagle, but the question is about the half dollar. So S11 is the key here. So the answer is Barber's design was selected despite the rejections of the original artists. So the correct citation is S11."

[S5] Behind them, the sun sets beyond San Francisco's Golden Gate, as yet unadorned by its bridge. [S6] Tom La Marre, in his 1987 article on the Panama–Pacific issue, pointed out that miners regarded the Golden Gate as a sign of good luck, and suggested it might have been better to depict it on a gold coin.

[S8] The obverse is based on Barber's earlier work, especially his medals for the annual Assay Commission. [S9] A representation of waves lies between the sun and the date, representing the maritime themes of the exposition. [S10] San Francisco's mint mark, S, is to the left of the date. [S11] The reverse depicts an eagle atop a Union shield, flanked by branches of olive, symbolizing peace, something Swiatek and Breen found ironic given the coin's issuance during World War I, and oak, the latter a choice which they were at a loss to explain. [S12] The 1915 Mint Director's report deemed the oak branch an \"emblem of strength\". [S13] Burdette notes that Barber's original design flanked the shield with two dolphins, representing the two oceans joined by the canal, instead of branches, and speculates, \"McAdoo either did not understand the allegory, did not care for it, or simply did not like aquatic mammals on coins\". [S14] McAdoo may also have been suffering from a surfeit of dolphins, as the dollar and octagonal $50 pieces bear them—the ones on the half dollar were removed and replaced by the branches.

[S3] Swiatek and Breen suggested that those involved in creating or approving the design may have moved to head off controversy. [S4] Barber's quarter eagle (the first of that denomination issued as a commemorative) depicts, according to the Mint Director's report, \"Columbia, representing the United States, seated [on] the mythical sea horse [a hippocampus], riding through the waters of the canal, with caduceus in grasp, the emblem of trade and commerce, inviting the nations of the world to use the new way from ocean to ocean. [S5] Reverse: American eagle, resting on a standard bearing the motto 'E Pluribus Unum' \". [S6] The mint mark is on the obverse, to the right of the date. [S7] Swiatek and Breen suggested that the caduceus (in modern usage a symbol of medicine) is \"said to represent the medical breakthroughs of Col. [S8] William C. [S9] Gorgas's successful campaign\" to control malaria and yellow fever at the canal site. [S10] They wrote that on the reverse, the \"defiant eagle probably alludes to the necessity of keeping the Canal open during World War I; the whole composition is meant to suggest a Roman legionary standard, which was a pole surmounted by some such device\". [S11] The obverse of the quarter eagle, Vermeule opined, derived from coins of ancient Greece depicting a \"Nereid, perhaps Thetis, who bears the shield of Achilles astride a hippocamp\". [S12] He suggested that the quarter eagle obverse \"may be Barber's answer to Theodore Roosevelt's and Augustus Saint-Gaudens' clamor for modern coins in the Greek manner\". [S13] The half dollar's reverse, along with that of the quarter eagle, \"are classic symphonies of old designs, motifs that trace back to the eagles and shields of [Charles Barber's predecessors as Chief Engraver] Longacre and William Barber revised into modern form.\"\n\n\n### Dollar and $50 pieces\n\nCharles Keck's obverse for the dollar was one of the alternative designs submitted to McAdoo, depicting the unadorned, capped head of a Panama Canal construction worker—Keck's original concept had featured Poseidon, god of the sea in Greek mythology. [S14] The worker, who represents the labor necessary to build the canal, is sometimes mistaken for a baseball player. [S15] Keck's reverse contains the words \"Panama–Pacific Exposition\", \"San Francisco\", the denomination of the coin, and two dolphins, symbolizing the joining of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by the canal.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what the caduceus on the Panama–Pacific quarter eagle represents according to Swiatek and Breen. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the sentences for mentions of Swiatek and Breen. Looking at the chunk provided, I see that [S3] mentions Swiatek and Breen suggesting that those involved in the design may have moved to head off controversy. But that's more about the overall design choices. Then, in [S7], it says \"Swiatek and Breen suggested that the caduceus (in modern usage a symbol of medicine) is 'said to represent the medical breakthroughs of Col.'\" Then it continues with [S8] and [S9], but [S8] is part of the same sentence. Wait, the exact sentence in [S7] is: \"Swiatek and Breen suggested that the caduceus (in modern usage a symbol of medicine) is 'said to represent the medical breakthroughs of Col. [S8] William C. [S9] Gorgas's successful campaign\" to control malaria and yellow fever at the canal site.\"\n\nSo the answer is that according to Swiatek and Breen, the caduceus represents the medical breakthroughs of Colonel William C. Gorgas's campaign to control malaria and yellow fever. The citations here would be [S7] and [S8], but wait, the sentence in [S7] includes the part about Swiatek and Breen's suggestion. The [S8] and [S9] are part of the same sentence, but the actual citation for the caduceus meaning is in [S7]. However, the user is asking for the answer according to Swiatek and Breen, so the citation would be [S7], and maybe [S8] if that's part of their statement. But looking at the structure, [S7] is the sentence where Swiatek and Breen's suggestion is mentioned. The [S8] and [S9] are part of the same sentence, but the exact wording is in [S7]. So the correct citation is [S7]. But I need to check if the sentence in [S7] is the one that contains the answer. Let me recheck:\n\n[S7] \"Swiatek and Breen suggested that the caduceus (in modern usage a symbol of medicine) is \"said to represent the medical breakthroughs of Col. [S8] William C. [S9] Gorgas's successful campaign\" to control malaria and yellow fever at the canal site.\"\n\nSo the entire statement in [S7] is the one where Swiatek and Breen's suggestion is made. Therefore, the citation should be [S7]. However, the mention of Col. William C. Gorgas is in [S8] and [S9], but those are part of the same sentence. But according to the format, each sentence is a separate statement. Wait, the user's supporting context has each sentence as a separate chunk with [S1], [S2], etc. So [S7] is a single sentence. The sentence in [S7] includes the part where Swiatek and Breen's suggestion is made. Therefore, the answer is based on [S7]. However, the actual name of Gorgas is in [S8] and [S9], but those are separate sentences. But the user is asking for the representation according to Swiatek and Breen, which is in [S7]. So the correct citation is [S7]. But I need to make sure that the answer is directly from that sentence. The answer is that the caduceus represents the medical breakthroughs of Col. William C. Gorgas's campaign. The citation would be [S7], but the name is split into [S8] and [S9]. However, in the context provided, each sentence is a separate entry. So [S7] is the sentence where Swiatek and Breen's statement is made. The rest are part of the same sentence? Or are they separate? Let me check the original context again.\n\nLooking at the original chunk:\n\n[S7] Swiatek and Breen suggested that the caduceus (in modern usage a symbol of medicine) is \"said to represent the medical breakthroughs of Col. [S8] William C. [S9] Gorgas's successful campaign\" to control malaria and yellow fever at the canal site.\n\nWait, this seems like a formatting error. The original text might have had the name split across sentences, but in the given context, [S7] includes the quote where the caduceus is said to represent Gorgas's campaign. However, the actual name \"William C. Gorgas\" is split into [S8] and [S9], which might be a mistake. But according to the provided context, [S7] is the sentence where Swiatek and Breen's suggestion is mentioned. Therefore, the answer should cite [S7]. However, if the name is in [S8] and [S9], but the question is about what Swiatek and Breen said, which is in [S7], then the citation is [S7]. So the answer is that the caduceus represents the medical breakthroughs of Col. William C. Gorgas's campaign, according to Swiatek and Breen, and the citation is [S7]."

      "chunk": "[S1] In response to the public outcry, Congress in 1908 passed legislation requiring its presence on any circulating coin which had previously borne it, as both gold pieces had until 1907. [S2] The wording on the Panama–Pacific pieces was left to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, but officials may have remembered the fracas. [S3] Swiatek and Breen suggested that those involved in creating or approving the design may have moved to head off controversy. [S4] Barber's quarter eagle (the first of that denomination issued as a commemorative) depicts, according to the Mint Director's report, \"Columbia, representing the United States, seated [on] the mythical sea horse [a hippocampus], riding through the waters of the canal, with caduceus in grasp, the emblem of trade and commerce, inviting the nations of the world to use the new way from ocean to ocean. [S5] Reverse: American eagle, resting on a standard bearing the motto 'E Pluribus Unum' \". [S6] The mint mark is on the obverse, to the right of the date. [S7] Swiatek and Breen suggested that the caduceus (in modern usage a symbol of medicine) is \"said to represent the medical breakthroughs of Col. [S8] William C. [S9] Gorgas's successful campaign\" to control malaria and yellow fever at the canal site. [S10] They wrote that on the reverse, the \"defiant eagle probably alludes to the necessity of keeping the Canal open during World War I; the whole composition is meant to suggest a Roman legionary standard, which was a pole surmounted by some such device\". [S11] The obverse of the quarter eagle, Vermeule opined, derived from coins of ancient Greece depicting a \"Nereid, perhaps Thetis, who bears the shield of Achilles astride a hippocamp\". [S12] He suggested that the quarter eagle obverse \"may be Barber's answer to Theodore Roosevelt's and Augustus Saint-Gaudens' clamor for modern coins in the Greek manner\". [S13] The half dollar's reverse, along with that of the quarter eagle, \"are classic symphonies of old designs, motifs that trace back to the eagles and shields of [Charles Barber's predecessors as Chief Engraver] Longacre and William Barber revised into modern form.\"\n\n\n### Dollar and $50 pieces\n\nCharles Keck's obverse for the dollar was one of the alternative designs submitted to McAdoo, depicting the unadorned, capped head of a Panama Canal construction worker—Keck's original concept had featured Poseidon, god of the sea in Greek mythology. [S14] The worker, who represents the labor necessary to build the canal, is sometimes mistaken for a baseball player. [S15] Keck's reverse contains the words \"Panama–Pacific Exposition\", \"San Francisco\", the denomination of the coin, and two dolphins, symbolizing the joining of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by the canal. [S16] The mint mark is beneath the letters D and O in \"Dollar\". [S17] Vermeule called Keck's dollar \"a novel, daring use of the limited area afforded by such a small, thin coin. [S18] Compared with the earlier gold dollars, the coin is a work of art.\" Numismatist Arlie Slabaugh, in his volume on commemoratives, noted that the Panama–Pacific dollar \"presents a bold American design, completely different from the classical styles used on the other denominations\".

[S3] Aitken explained his design for the $50 pieces:\n\n> In order to express in my design the fact that this coin is struck to commemorate the Panama–Pacific Exposition, and as the exposition stands for all that wisdom and industry have produced, I have used as the central motive [motif] of the obverse, the head of the virgin goddess Minerva. [S4] She is the goddess of wisdom, of skill, of contemplation ... [S5] Moreover, she features prominently on the seal of the State of California ... [S6] the use of the dolphins on the octagonal coin do much to add to its charm, as well as express the uninterrupted water route made possible by the canal. [S7] Upon the reverse I use the owl, the bird sacred to Minerva, also the symbol of wisdom ... [S8] With these simple symbols, all full of beauty in themselves, I feel that I have expressed the larger meaning of the exposition, its appeal to the intellect. [S9] The goddess wears a crested helmet, as her Greek equivalent, Pallas Athena, was commonly depicted on ancient coins; it is pushed back to signify her peaceful intentions. [S10] She wears mail, which Swiatek and Breen found an odd anachronism. [S11] She bears upon her shield the Roman numerals MCMXV for the year 1915, the second use of Roman numerals on U.S. [S12] coins after the early types of the 1907 Saint-Gaudens double eagle. [S13] Though Aitken had originally expressed the date as \"1915\" in his original sketches, he soon changed his mind, \"As these designs will not be used in any other year, there will be no need to change the year as we must on other coins.\"\n\nKevin Flynn, in his book on commemorative coins, described the branch on which the owl perches as that of a ponderosa pine tree; several cones are visible. [S14] The design on the octagonal piece is smaller than on the round, to allow space for the border featuring the dolphins. [S15] The mint mark is on the reverse, adjacent to the rightmost pine cone and directly above the letter \"O\" in \"San Francisco\". [S16] The design for the $50 received contemporary criticism; some suggested that the presence of the dolphins on the octagonal coin implied that the canal had been constructed for cetacean convenience. [S17] A 1916 column in the *American Journal of Numismatics* contained the conclusion that \"the criticism often heard that 'there is nothing American about the coin except the inscription' is fully warranted.\" Swiatek and Breen dismissed criticisms as \"numerous and mostly irrelevant, based on total misreading of the iconography. [S18] [McAdoo began it] with stupid claims that Pallas Athena meant nothing on a U.S. [S19] coin unless she could be identified with Liberty, and that Athena's owl would never mean anything to all of us\". [S20] Vermeule deemed the $50 coins \"a tour de force, dated to be sure, but unusual enough in all respects to be worthy of what American numismatic art could achieve\". [S21] Later Chief Engraver Elizabeth Jones felt that the $50 pieces were \"stylistically in step with the period [and have] considerable artistic merits\". [S22] Jeff Garrett and Ron Guth, in their book on U.S. [S23] gold coins, deemed the Panama–Pacific $50 pieces \"one of the most stunning issues ever produced by the U.S. [S24] government\".

[S3] ## Production and distribution\n\nOnce the designs were approved, the artists prepared bronze casts to be sent to the Medallic Art Company in New York. [S4] There, hubs would be made that the Mint could use to produce coinage dies, as the company could do it faster than could the Mint. [S5] The Panama–Pacific issues are the first American coins known to have been produced from hubs provided by a private company—the Medallic Art Company prepared hubs for the 1913 Buffalo nickel, but it is uncertain if they were used. [S6] The Panama–Pacific hubs were sent to the Philadelphia Mint, where the Engraving Department, headed by Barber, would produce the necessary dies. [S7] Although the authorizing statute required that the coins be struck in San Francisco, all coinage dies at that time were produced by Barber and his assistants in Philadelphia. [S8] By April, Robert W. [S9] Woolley had been commissioned as Director of the Mint, and he approved samples of the gold dollar, the first to have work completed, on April 22. [S10] He then traveled to San Francisco, and was there when the dies for the dollar arrived on the 27th. [S11] When the San Francisco Mint's coiner examined them, they proved to be lacking the mint mark \"S\", customary on coins produced there. [S12] Woolley was not sure if this was intentional, and wired to Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. [S13] Joyce on the 29th. [S14] Upon learning that it was intentional—Joyce reasoned that as the entire mintage of this, the first commemorative issue to be struck outside Philadelphia, would be produced at San Francisco, there was no need to use a mint mark—Woolley ordered that the dies at San Francisco and in transit be returned to Philadelphia, and new ones produced with the mint mark. [S15] Woolley believed that people would assume the coins were struck at Philadelphia, which did not then use a mint mark. [S16] Burdette notes that the San Francisco Mint was a source of local pride and the omission of the mint mark would likely have led to widespread protest, and possibly to two varieties of each of the new coins: with mint mark, and without. [S17] New dollar dies were sent from Philadelphia on May 3, and for the half dollar the following day. [S18] Dies for the $50 followed on May 14, and for the quarter eagle on May 27. [S19] Containing 2.4286 troy ounces (2.6645 oz; 75.54 g) of gold and measuring 44.9 millimetres (1.77 in) across for the octagonal) and 43 millimetres (1.7 in) in diameter for the round, the $50 pieces were the largest and heaviest U.S. [S20] coins issued until surpassed in 2010 by the America the Beautiful silver bullion coins. [S21] The octagonal $50 piece is the only U.S. [S22] coin that is not round. [S23] The facilities at the San Francisco Mint were inadequate to strike such large coins as the $50 pieces, and a hydraulic medal press was shipped from Philadelphia. [S24] This press was ceremoniously operated at that mint on June 15, 1915 for the initial striking of $50 octagonal pieces; the first by San Francisco Mint Superintendent T. [S25] W. [S26] H. [S27] Shanahan, for presentation to the exposition's president, Charles C. [S28] Moore. [S29] The next nine were struck by other dignitaries, including Congressman Kahn.

[S3] Anyone else present with the price of $100 per coin was then allowed to strike their own piece, and at least three people, including Dewey's wife and the local postmaster, did so. [S4] The Panama–Pacific Exposition Company hired Farran Zerbe to sell the new coins at the fair. [S5] Despite the provisions of the law mandating a delivery of coins before the fair's opening, the only government products Zerbe initially had to vend at his \"Money of the World\" exhibit were a souvenir medal, designed by Aitken and struck by a press operating at the Mint's exhibit, and prints produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, also on-site. [S6] Sales of the medal were slow, and Zerbe did not have coins to sell until soon after May 8, 1915, when the half dollar and dollar dies were received. [S7] Zerbe found the coins hard to sell; many potential purchasers, faced with a plethora of medals, reproductions of Gold Rush-era pioneer gold coins, and other wares from a variety of vendors, did not believe his coins were official government products. [S8] Treasury officials agreed to allow him space for a salesperson at the Mint's exhibit, and the two lower denominations were sold there, with orders taken for the $50 pieces. [S9] Soon, though, Zerbe stopped selling the gold dollar there, and the rest of the fair's run was marked by conflict between him and Treasury representatives. [S10] The full legal allocation for each denomination had been struck, but though Zerbe continued selling coins by mail after the fair closed on December 4, 1915, sales dropped through 1916. [S11] Zerbe continued to sell coins on behalf of the exposition until at least November 1916, and at some point, he sold an unknown quantity to himself to supply the future needs of his coin business. [S12] The remainder were melted by the Treasury. [S13] The Mint struck 1,500 of each of the two $50 pieces, plus nine extra of the octagonal and ten of the round, to be sent to Philadelphia to await the 1916 meeting of the annual Assay Commission, when they would be available for inspection and testing. [S14] Zerbe had arranged for special display boxes and cases. [S15] A set of four denominations (with the purchaser's choice of round or octagonal for the $50) cost $100; a set of five cost $200. [S16] Copper display frames with two of each coin were said by Slabaugh to have cost $400, but Swiatek, in his 2011 book on commemoratives, indicates that these sets may actually have been given to dignitaries, as no sales receipts or correspondence relating to them are known. [S17] A set of the three smaller denominations sold for $7, the half dollar at $1, the gold dollar at $2 or $2.25 (prices may have varied), and the quarter eagle at $4 each. [S18] ## Collecting and mintages\n\nMore of the octagonal $50 pieces were sold than of the round, as the former proved more popular because of the association with the Gold Rush, and because people liked the dolphins. [S19] As half of the 3,000 authorized mintage for the $50 pieces were of each variety, this meant more of the round ones would be melted, leaving the round $50 with the lowest distribution of any U.S. [S20] commemorative coin, about 483—the runner up being the octagonal with about 645, though sources vary on the exact numbers distributed. [S21] The half dollar and dollar are known struck in different metals; pieces believed to have been struck to create rarities. [S22] The $50 pieces stood as the highest denomination U.S. [S23] coins for many years. [S24] In 1986, the Mint began producing the American Gold Eagle, also with face value $50.

      "answer": "<statement>The Panama–Pacific half dollar is listed at between $375 and $2,500 according to Yeoman's guide.<cite>[S5]</cite></statement> <statement>The Panama–Pacific dollar is listed at between $525 and $1,775 according to Yeoman's guide.<cite>[S6]</cite></statement> <statement>The Panama–Pacific quarter eagle is listed at between $1,550 and $6,000 according to Yeoman's guide.<cite>[S6]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the price ranges for the Panama–Pacific half dollar, dollar, and quarter eagle according to Yeoman's guide. I need to look through the supporting context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of Yeoman's guide. Sentence S5 says: \"Yeoman's *A Guide Book of United States Coins*, published in 2018, lists the Panama–Pacific half dollar at between $375 and $2,500, depending on condition.\" So that's the half dollar. Then, looking at S6: \"The dollar lists at between $525 and $1,775 and the quarter eagle between $1,550 and $6,000.\" \n\nWait, the question is about the half dollar, dollar, and quarter eagle. The S5 and S6 sentences mention all three. The other sentences like S7 talk about the $50 pieces, which are different. The table in S8 has mintage numbers but not the price ranges. \n\nSo the answer should combine the info from S5 and S6. Each of those sentences would have citations. The half dollar is in S5, the dollar and quarter eagle are in S6. So the answer would be:\n\nThe Panama–Pacific half dollar is listed at $375–$2,500 (S5), the dollar at $525–$1,775 (S6), and the quarter eagle at $1,550–$6,000 (S6). \n\nI need to make sure each part is correctly cited. The half dollar is S5, and the dollar and quarter eagle are S6. So the statements would be split accordingly. Also, check if there are any other sentences, but I don't think so. The rest of the sentences are about other coins or the table. So the answer should be accurate."
