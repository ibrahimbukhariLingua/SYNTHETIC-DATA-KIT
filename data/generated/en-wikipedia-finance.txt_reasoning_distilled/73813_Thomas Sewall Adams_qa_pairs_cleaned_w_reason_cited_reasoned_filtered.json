Let me check again. \n\nThe other sentences talk about his education, his time at Yale, his role with the Treasury Department, but those are outside the 1911-1915 timeframe. The key part here is S9.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking about Adams' role with the U.S. Treasury Department. I need to look through the supporting context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of the U.S. Treasury Department. Let's go through each sentence:\n\n[S1] Just mentions his name, nothing about the Treasury.\n[S2] Says he was an advisor to the U.S. [S3] Treasury Department. So that's a direct mention. The sentence here is [S2], but the citation is [S3]? Wait, the text in [S2] is \"He was advisor to the U.S. [S3] Treasury Department...\" So the actual sentence that states his role is [S2], but the citation is [S3]? Wait, maybe the numbering is off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the passage is structured with each sentence numbered [S1], [S2], etc. So [S2] is \"He was advisor to the U.S. [S3] Treasury Department, and a key architect...\" So the sentence [S2] mentions that he was an advisor to the U.S. Treasury Department. But the way it's written, maybe the [S3] is a citation. Wait, the user provided the supporting context as chunks with [S1], [S2], etc. So each [S1] is a sentence. So [S2] is \"He was advisor to the U.S. [S3] Treasury Department...\" Wait, that seems like a typo. Maybe the original text had a line break or something. Maybe [S2] is \"He was advisor to the U.S.\" and [S3] is \"Treasury Department...\" but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the sentence [S2] is \"He was advisor to the U.S. [S3] Treasury Department...\" which would mean that the sentence [S2] is stating that he was an advisor to the Treasury Department, and the [S3] is a citation. But the way it's written here, the user's input has [S2] as \"He was advisor to the U.S. [S3] Treasury Department, and a key architect...\" So perhaps the actual sentence is [S2], which includes the part about the Treasury Department. So the answer would be that Adams was an advisor to the U.S. Treasury Department, cited from [S2]. But maybe there's another sentence that also mentions it. Let me check the rest.\n\nLooking further, [S11] and [S12] have \"U. [S11] S. [S12] Treasury\" which seems like a typo, maybe \"U.S. Treasury\" split into [S11] and [S12]. Then [S13] says \"economic adviser to the U. [S11] S. [S12] Treasury (1917\u20131933)\" so that's another mention. So the role is mentioned in [S2], [S13], and maybe others. But the exact role is \"advisor\" in [S2] and \"economic adviser\" in [S13]. Also, [S13] mentions the period 1917-1933. So the answer should combine that. But the question is about his role, so the main points are being an advisor and economic adviser. The citations would be [S2], [S13], and maybe [S3] if that's a separate sentence. Wait, looking back, the original passage's [S3] is part of the sentence in [S2]. So maybe the correct citations are [S2] and [S13]. Also, [S13] says \"economic adviser to the U.S. Treasury (1917\u20131933)\", so that's another citation. So the answer would be that Adams was an advisor and economic adviser to the U.S. Treasury Department, with citations from [S2] and [S13]. Also, [S3] might be part of the same sentence. Wait, the original text in [S2] is: \"He was advisor to the U.S. [S3] Treasury Department, and a key architect...\" So maybe [S3] is a separate sentence that's part of the same paragraph. Wait, the user's input shows that each chunk is a sentence. So [S1] is a sentence, [S2] is another, etc. So [S2] is \"He was advisor to the U.S. [S3] Treasury Department, and a key architect...\" which seems like a formatting error. Maybe the original text had a line break, and [S3] is actually part of the same sentence. But according to the given structure, each [S1], [S2], etc., is a separate sentence. So [S2] is \"He was advisor to the U.S.\" and [S3] is \"Treasury Department, and a key architect...\" But that would split the sentence. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the formatting. But given the way it's presented, I have to take each [S1], [S2], etc., as separate sentences. So [S2] is \"He was advisor to the U.S.\" and [S3] is \"Treasury Department, and a key architect...\" which would make sense if they are part of the same sentence. But the user's input shows that each is a separate sentence. This is a bit confusing. However, the user's instruction says that each sentence is inside <statement> tags with the citations. So perhaps the correct approach is to take each [S1], [S2], etc., as separate sentences. Therefore, [S2] is \"He was advisor to the U.S.\" and [S3] is \"Treasury Department, and a key architect...\" So the actual role is mentioned in [S3], but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the user intended that [S2] includes the Treasury Department part. Given the ambiguity, but based on the provided text, the answer would be that Adams was an advisor to the U.S. Treasury Department, as stated in [S2] and [S13]. Also, [S13] mentions \"economic adviser\" which is a more specific role. So the answer should combine these. Therefore, the statement would be \"Adams was an advisor and economic adviser to the U.S. Treasury Department.\" with citations [S2][S13]. Also, [S3] might be part of the same sentence as [S2], but given the structure, I have to follow the provided citations. So the final answer would have the statement with those citations."

Let me go through each sentence.\n\n[S1] Just mentions his name and that he was an American economist. So that's a start. [S2] Talks about him being an advisor to the U.S. Treasury Department and a key architect of the post-WWI fiscal state. That suggests economics or fiscal policy. [S3] Same as [S2], maybe? Wait, the numbering might be off. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the chunk provided:\n\n[S1] Thomas Sewall Adams\n\nThen the main text starts. The first sentence after the heading is [S2]: \"He was advisor to the U.S. [S3] Treasury Department...\" So maybe there's a typo here. The sentence in [S2] says he was an advisor to the U.S. Treasury Department. Then [S3] is part of the same sentence? Or maybe the numbering is incorrect. But regardless, the key points are in [S2] and [S3]. \n\nLooking at the rest: [S4] is about his biography. [S5] talks about his education. [S6] his appointment as assistant to the Treasurer of Puerto Rico. [S7] his role at University of Wisconsin. [S8] mentions he was a full professor. [S9] his work on tax laws. [S10] his position at Yale. [S11] and [S12] mention Treasury again. [S13] says he was an economic adviser to the U.S. Treasury and involved in taxation policy.\n\nSo the main points about his field of expertise would be economics, political economy, fiscal policy, taxation. The passage mentions he was a Professor of Political Economy at Yale, which directly states his field. Also, his work with the Treasury Department and tax laws. \n\nSo the answer should be that his field was economics, specifically political economy, and he worked on fiscal and taxation policies. The citations would be [S2], [S3], [S13], and maybe [S10] where he was a professor. But the question is about his field of expertise, so the most direct citations are [S2] (advisor to Treasury, key architect of post-WWI fiscal state) and [S13] (economic adviser to Treasury, taxation policy). Also, [S1] mentions he was an economist. \n\nWait, the first sentence after the heading is [S2]: \"He was advisor to the U.S. [S3] Treasury Department...\" So maybe [S2] and [S3] are separate sentences? But the way it's written, maybe [S2] is incomplete. Let me check the original chunk again.\n\nOriginal chunk:\n\n[S1] Thomas Sewall Adams\n\n\n# Thomas Sewall Adams\n\n\n\n**Thomas Sewall Adams** (December 29, 1873 \u2013 February 8, 1933) was an American economist who was Professor of Political Economy at Yale University. [S2] He was advisor to the U.S. [S3] Treasury Department, and a key architect of the post-WWI fiscal state in the United States. [S4] ## Biography\n\nSo the sentence starting with \"He was advisor...\" is [S2], but it's cut off. Then [S3] is \"Treasury Department, and a key architect...\" So maybe [S2] and [S3] are part of the same sentence. But the way the citations are numbered, [S2] is the first part, and [S3] is the second part. So the full sentence would be [S2] and [S3] together. But in the response format, each sentence is in its own <statement> tag. So perhaps the sentence \"He was advisor to the U.S. Treasury Department, and a key architect of the post-WWI fiscal state in the United States.\" is split into [S2] and [S3], but that's a bit confusing. However, the user's instruction says to use the sentence numbers as given. So if the sentence is split, maybe each part is a separate statement. But the user might have intended that [S2] and [S3] are part of the same sentence. However, the exact structure is unclear. \n\nIn any case, the key information is that he was an economist, Professor of Political Economy, advisor to the Treasury, and involved in fiscal and taxation policies. So the answer would be that his field was economics, specifically political economy, and fiscal policy. The citations would be [S1] (he was an economist), [S2] and [S3] (advisor to Treasury, key architect), [S13] (economic adviser, taxation policy). Also, [S10] mentions his position at Yale as a professor. But the question is about his field of expertise, so the most direct answers are [S1], [S2], [S3], [S13]. \n\nBut the user's example shows that each sentence is in its own <statement> with citations. So I need to structure each sentence properly. For example, the first sentence after the heading is \"Thomas Sewall Adams (December 29, 1873 \u2013 February 8, 1933) was an American economist who was Professor of Political Economy at Yale University.\" That's [S1], but in the chunk, [S1] is just \"Thomas Sewall Adams\" and then the rest is the content. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe chunk starts with:\n\n[S1] Thomas Sewall Adams\n\n\n# Thomas Sewall Adams\n\n\n\n**Thomas Sewall Adams** (December 29, 1873 \u2013 February 8, 1933) was an American economist who was Professor of Political Economy at Yale University. [S2] He was advisor to the U.S. [S3] Treasury Department, and a key architect of the post-WWI fiscal state in the United States. [S4] ## Biography\n\nSo [S1] is just the name, then the next sentence is the one about him being an economist and professor, which is [S2]? Wait, no. The sentence after the heading is:\n\n\"**Thomas Sewall Adams** (December 29, 1873 \u2013 February 8, 1933) was an American economist who was Professor of Political Economy at Yale University. [S2] He was advisor to the U.S. [S3] Treasury Department, and a key architect of the post-WWI fiscal state in the United States. [S4] ## Biography\"\n\nSo the first sentence is \"Thomas Sewall Adams... Yale University.\" and that's [S2]? Or is [S1] the name, and the next sentence is [S2]? The way it's written, the first sentence after the heading is [S2], but the [S1] is just the name. So the actual content starts with [S2]. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. But according to the chunk provided, the first sentence is [S1] which is just the name, then the next sentence is the one about him being an economist and professor, which is [S2]. Then the next sentence is [S3], etc. \n\nBut in the actual text, the first sentence after the heading is:\n\n\"**Thomas Sewall Adams** (December 29, 1873 \u2013 February 8, 1933) was an American economist who was Professor of Political Economy at Yale University. [S2] He was advisor to the U.S. [S3] Treasury Department, and a key architect of the post-WWI fiscal state in the United States. [S4] ## Biography\"\n\nSo the sentence \"was an American economist...\" is [S2], and the next sentence \"He was advisor...\" is [S3], but the [S2] is part of the previous sentence. This seems like a formatting error. However, the user has provided the citations as [S1] to [S13], so I have to go with that. \n\nAssuming that the sentence \"He was advisor to the U.S. Treasury Department, and a key architect...\" is [S2] and [S3], but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe [S2] is the entire sentence about being an economist and professor. \n\nBut given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the information as given. The key point is that the passage states he was an economist and Professor of Political Economy, which directly answers the question. So the answer would be that his field was economics, specifically political economy, and he worked on fiscal policy. The citations would be [S1] (if that's the name, but the question is about his field, so maybe [S2] where he's called an economist). \n\nWait, the first sentence after the heading is [S2], which says \"He was an American economist who was Professor of Political Economy at Yale University.\" So that's [S2]. Then [S3] is \"He was advisor to the U.S. Treasury Department...\" So the answer would be that his field was economics, as stated in [S2], and his expertise in fiscal policy from [S3] and [S13]. \n\nSo the correct citations would be [S2] for being an economist and professor, [S3] for advisor to Treasury, and [S13] for economic adviser and taxation policy. Also, [S10] mentions his position at Yale, but [S2] is more direct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be: Adams' field of expertise was economics, specifically political economy, as he was a Professor of Political Economy at Yale University and an advisor to the U.S. Treasury Department. Citations would be [S2], [S3], [S13]."

Because he later went to Johns Hopkins University, so the sequence would be high school then college. So Baltimore City College might be his high school. But I should check if there's any other mention. \n\nThe rest of the sentences talk about his university education, like BA and PhD from Johns Hopkins, and his career. There's no other high school mentioned. So the answer should be Baltimore City College. The citation would be [S5]. Let me make sure there's no other possible answer.
