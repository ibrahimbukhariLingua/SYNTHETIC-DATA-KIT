  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this legal case between Amazon and Canada's Commissioner of Patents. Let me start by reading through the document carefully.\n\nThe main topic is about the patentability of business methods, specifically Amazon's one-click purchasing method. The case went through several courts. The Commissioner initially rejected the patent, saying business methods aren't patentable. But the Federal Court disagreed, saying business methods should be evaluated under the Patent Act's categories. The Federal Court of Appeal agreed with some points but sent it back for reconsideration without fully approving the patent.\n\nKey points: The dispute was over whether a business method (one-click buying) is patentable. The courts discussed the \"form and substance\" of the claims, the definition of \"art\" in the Patent Act, and the need for technological advancement. The Federal Court of Appeal didn't confirm the patentability but emphasized that business methods must still meet the Act's criteria. The outcome led to updated guidelines from the Canadian Patent Office.\n\nI need to condense this into 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts. Make sure to mention the patentability of business methods, the courts' decisions, the legal arguments, and the impact on patent guidelines.\n</think>\n\nThe case *Amazon.com Inc v Canada (Commissioner of Patents)* addressed the patentability of business methods, specifically Amazon's one-click online purchasing system, under Canada's Patent Act. The Federal Court initially ruled that business methods could be patentable if they fall within statutory categories like \"machine\" or \"art,\" rejecting the Commissioner's claim that they were inherently unpatentable. However, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld the need for a \"purposive construction\" of claims and remanded the case, emphasizing that business methods must still meet statutory requirements, such as technological innovation, and cannot be excluded categorically. The decision influenced Canadian patent guidelines, reinforcing that business methods are assessed on their merits rather than being automatically excluded, while requiring evidence of technological advancement.",

      "question": "What invention did Amazon.com patent in 1998?",
      "answer": "<statement>The invention that Amazon.com patented in 1998 was a \"Method and System For Placing A Purchase Order Via A Communication Network\".<cite>[S3]</cite></statement> <statement>This invention enabled customers to make online purchases with one-click buying, bypassing the need to enter address and billing information repeatedly.<cite>[S4]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what invention Amazon.com patented in 1998. The supporting context provided is about a legal case involving Amazon's patent application.\n\nFirst, I need to scan through the given text to find mentions of an invention from 1998. Looking at the sentences, [S3] mentions that in 1998, Amazon.com filed a patent application for a \"Method and System For Placing A Purchase Order Via A Communication Network\". Then, [S4] explains that this invention allowed one-click buying, which skips entering address and billing info. \n\nThe question is about the invention itself, not the patent's approval. The answer should be the specific method they patented. The key sentences here are [S3] and [S4]. However, the user wants the answer with citations. Since [S3] directly states the patent application's title, and [S4] describes the invention, both are relevant. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other invention mentioned. The rest of the context talks about the legal proceedings and the court's decision, which isn't directly relevant to the invention itself. So the answer is the \"Method and System For Placing A Purchase Order Via A Communication Network\" from [S3], and [S4] provides more details. Therefore, the citations should be [S3] and [S4]."

      "question": "What criteria did the Commissioner of Patents use to evaluate the patent application?",
      "answer": "<statement>The Commissioner of Patents evaluated the form and substance of the claim, requiring both the text of the claim and its nature to be assessed.<cite>[S9][S10][S11]</cite></statement> <statement>The substance of the invention had to fall within statutory categories of invention under section 2 of the *Patent Act*.<cite>[S12]</cite></statement> <statement>The Commissioner determined that business methods, like Amazon's one-click purchasing, were not historically patentable and lacked technological advancement.<cite>[S13][S14][S16][S17][S18][S19]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what criteria the Commissioner of Patents used to evaluate the patent application. I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the relevant sentences.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of the Commissioner's criteria. In the section titled \"Commissioner of Patents\", there's a lot of information. Sentence S8 mentions that the Commissioner made several findings in rejecting the application. Then, looking at S9, it says the Commissioner noted that both the form and substance of the claim must be evaluated. \n\nBreaking that down, form refers to the text of the claim (S9 and S10), and substance is about the nature of the invention and what it adds to human knowledge (S10 and S11). Then S12 states that the substance must fall within one of the statutory categories under section 2 of the Patent Act. \n\nAdditionally, the Commissioner evaluated whether the invention was a business method, citing S13 and S14. They considered if business methods are patentable, referencing the Monsanto case. Also, in S16, the Commissioner didn't define \"business method\" but concluded that business methods aren't technological, hence not patentable. \n\nSo the main criteria are evaluating form and substance, checking statutory categories, and determining if it's a business method. The citations would be S9, S10, S11, S12, S13, S14, S16, S17, S18, S19. Wait, need to check each part. The form and substance are in S9, S10, S11. The statutory categories in S12. The business method analysis in S13, S14, S16, S17, S18, S19. \n\nBut the question is about the criteria used. So the key points are form and substance, statutory categories, and business method evaluation. So the sentences that directly mention the criteria are S9 (form and substance), S12 (statutory categories), and the parts about business methods. However, the exact criteria would be the form and substance, and ensuring it's within statutory categories. The business method part is more about the application of those criteria. \n\nSo the answer should include the evaluation of form and substance, checking statutory categories, and considering if it's a business method. The citations would be S9, S10, S11, S12, S13, S14, S16, S17, S18, S19. But need to make sure each sentence is correctly cited. For example, the form and substance are in S9, S10, S11. The statutory categories in S12. The business method analysis in S13, S14, S16, S17, S18, S19. \n\nBut the user wants each sentence in the answer to have its own citations. So the answer would be structured as multiple statements, each with their citations. For example, the first statement about form and substance would cite S9, S10, S11. Then the statutory categories in S12. Then the business method part citing S13, S14, S16, etc. But need to check if each part is a separate sentence. \n\nLooking at the context, each sentence is numbered. So the answer should be broken into sentences, each with their citations. For example:\n\n\"The Commissioner evaluated the form and substance of the claim.\" [S9][S10][S11]\n\n\"Substance required the invention to fall within statutory categories under section 2 of the Patent Act.\" [S12]\n\n\"The Commissioner considered whether the invention was a business method, citing previous cases.\" [S13][S14][S16]\n\nAnd so on. But need to make sure each statement is a separate sentence. The user's example shows that each statement is a separate sentence with its own citations. So the answer should be structured that way."

[S2] Amazon.com proceed to commence an appeal of the Commissioner's decision at the Federal Court of Canada in 2010. [S3] ### Federal Court of Canada\n\nAt the Federal Court, Justice Phelan decisively quashed the Commissioner's decision. [S4] First, the Court found that the \"form and substance\" formulation and analysis of Amazon.com's claims departed from the approach articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in *Free World Trust v Électro Santé Inc* and *Whirlpool Corp v Camco Inc*, which stated that the identification of the invention must be done through a purposive construction of its claims. [S5] Second, the Court found that the \"technological\" requirement was too restrictive in the test for an \"art\". [S6] The Court could find nothing in Canadian jurisprudence which would support such a requirement. [S7] Third, Justice Phelan concluded that there was no \"tradition\" for the categorical exclusion of \"business methods\" from patentability in Canada. [S8] Instead, the Court states that business methods were to be assessed pursuant to the five categories found within section 2 of the *Patent Act*. [S9] The Court then went on to consider the claims and find that a purposive construction of Amazon.com's claims disclosed a \"machine\", a patentable subject matter under section 2 of the *Patent Act*, which implemented something more than just a \"mathematical formula\". [S10] Given this characterization of Amazon.com's claims and its rejection of the Commissioner's decision, the Court sent the case back to the Commissioner with the direction that the claims constitute patentable subject matter. [S11] The Commissioner of Patents then appealed the decision to the Federal Court of Appeal, which released its decision in late 2011. [S12] ## Ruling\n\nThe Federal Court of Appeal essentially agreed with the three criticisms the Federal Court offered for the Commissioner's decision. [S13] The Court, however, also added that \"it does not necessarily follow…that a business method that is not itself patentable subject matter because it is an abstract idea becomes patentable subject matter merely because it has a practical embodiment or a practical application. [S14] In my view, this cannot be a distinguishing test, because it is axiomatic that a business method always has or is intended to have a practical application.\" Thus, the Court of Appeal did not affirm Justice Phelan's finding that Amazon.com's claims constituted patentable subject matter. [S15] Instead, it noted that Amazon.com's claim may still fail if, per *Schlumberger Canada Ltd v Canada (Commissioner of Patents)*, the only novel aspect of the claimed invention was the business method and the business method was interpreted as a \"mere scientific principle or abstract theorem\", which cannot be the subject matter of an invention according to section 27(8) of the *Patent Act*, mentioned above. [S16] Despite agreeing with most of the substance of the Federal Court's judgement, Justice Sharlow, writing for the Federal Court of Appeal, found that it was inappropriate for Justice Phelan to pursue his own purposive construction of the claims advanced by Amazon.com. [S17] Purposive construction must be executed with a foundation of knowledge about the relevant art. [S18] Justice Phelan did not have expert evidence before the Federal Court from persons skilled in the art, and therefore it would have been more appropriate for the Commissioner to re-examine the claims, given the expertise of the Patent Office. [S19] Accordingly, the Federal Court of Appeal remanded the application to the Commissioner for expedited reconsideration. [S20] ## Aftermath\n\nThe Commissioner of Patents issued the patent in December 2011.",
      "question": "What did the Federal Court of Canada criticize about the Commissioner's approach?",
      "answer": "<statement>The Federal Court of Canada criticized the Commissioner's approach for departing from the Supreme Court of Canada's methodology in *Free World Trust v Électro Santé Inc* and *Whirlpool Corp v Camco Inc*, specifically regarding the \"form and substance\" formulation of Amazon.com's claims.<cite>[S4]</cite></statement> <statement>The Court also found that the Commissioner's \"technological\" requirement was overly restrictive in determining patentable subject matter, as there was no supporting Canadian jurisprudence for such a criterion.<cite>[S5][S6]</cite></statement> <statement>Additionally, the Federal Court criticized the Commissioner for relying on a non-existent \"tradition\" of excluding \"business methods\" from patentability, emphasizing that such methods should be assessed under the categories outlined in section 2 of the *Patent Act*.<cite>[S7][S8]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what the Federal Court of Canada criticized about the Commissioner's approach.

That's one criticism. [S5] says the Court found the \"technological\" requirement was too restrictive. [S6] states there was no support in Canadian jurisprudence for that requirement. [S7] points out there's no tradition of excluding business methods from patents. \n\nSo the main points are the departure from the Supreme Court's method, the restrictive technological requirement, lack of jurisprudence support, and the absence of a tradition for excluding business methods.

      "answer": "<statement>The purpose of the new guidelines published by CIPO was to determine whether an invention constitutes statutory subject matter based on a purposive construction of the claims.<cite>[S5]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking about the purpose of the new guidelines published by CIPO. I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the sentences given, sentence S5 mentions that CIPO published new guidelines for determining whether an invention constitutes statutory subject matter based on a purposive construction of the claims. That seems directly related to the purpose. Also, sentence S6 talks about updated guidance on examination practice for computer-related inventions. But the question specifically asks about the purpose of the new guidelines. \n\nThe key part here is \"determining whether an invention constitutes statutory subject matter based on a purposive construction of the claims.\" That's the purpose. So the answer should be that the guidelines were published to determine statutory subject matter using a purposive construction. The citation would be S5. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other sentence that contributes. S4 mentions changes in patent examination practice based on the Amazon.com case, but the specific purpose is in S5. So the answer is based on S5."
