[S2] As of January 8, 2024, Dollar General operated 19,643 stores in the contiguous United States and Mexico. [S3] The company began in 1939 in Scottsville, Kentucky, as a family-owned business called J.L. [S4] Turner and Son, owned by James Luther Turner and Cal Turner. [S5] In 1955, the name changed to Dollar General Corporation, and in 1968 the company went public on the New York Stock Exchange. [S6] The Fortune 500 recognized Dollar General in 1999, and in 2020 it reached #112 on the list. [S7] Dollar General has grown to become one of the most profitable stores in the rural United States, with revenue reaching around $27 billion in 2019. [S8] The company and its business practices have been subject to criticism, particularly regarding how it may be creating and perpetuating food deserts and stifling local businesses while offering fewer and lower-paying jobs. [S9] ## History\n\n\n### J.L. [S10] Turner and Son: 1939–1964\n\nDollar General has its origin in Scottsville, Kentucky, with James Luther \"J.L.\" Turner and his son Cal Turner. [S11] James Turner's father died in an accident in 1902 when James was only 11. [S12] James quit school to work on the family farm, helping to provide for his mother and siblings, and subsequently never completed his education. [S13] After two unsuccessful attempts at retailing, James became a traveling dry goods salesman for a Nashville wholesale grocer. [S14] James left the sales job after 10 years and settled his family in Scottsville, Kentucky. [S15] During the Great Depression, he began buying and liquidating bankrupt general stores. [S16] Cal accompanied his father to these closeouts at a young age, gaining valuable business knowledge and skills. [S17] In October 1939, James and Cal opened **J.L. [S18] Turner and Son** with an initial investment of $5,000 each (equivalent to $110,000 in 2023). [S19] The switch to retailing resulted in annual sales above $2 million by the early 1950s. [S20] By the mid-1950s Turner had 35 department stores in Kentucky and Tennessee. [S21] In 1955, Cal Turner developed his idea of a retail store selling goods for a dollar, based on the Dollar Days promotions held at other department stores, by converting Turner's Department Store in Springfield, Kentucky, into the first Dollar General Store. [S22] In 1964, J.L. [S23] Turner died, leaving his son Cal Turner to succeed him. [S24] ### 1968–2002\n\nThe company Cal Turner co-founded went public as **Dollar General Corporation** in 1968, posting annual sales of more than $40 million and net income in excess of $1.5 million. [S25] In 1977, Cal Turner Jr., who joined the company in 1965 as a third-generation Turner, succeeded his father as CEO of Dollar General. [S26] In 1989, Cal Sr. [S27] retired as chairman and the company headquarters were moved to Tennessee. [S28] Under his son's leadership, the company grew to more than 6,000 stores and $6 billion in sales. [S29] In 1997 a distribution center was established in South Boston, Virginia. [S30] In 2000, Dollar General opened a new corporate headquarters in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. [S31] By the end of 2000, sales at Dollar General exceeded $4 billion. [S32] The distribution center in Homerville, Georgia, was closed in April 2000 and operations were moved to a new distribution center in Alachua, Florida. [S33] Cal Jr. [S34] retired in 2002 and was succeeded by David Perdue on April 2, 2003. [S35] ### 2003–present\n\nDollar General entered the grocery market with the establishment of Dollar General Market in 2003.

      "answer": "<statement>Dollar General Corporation changed its name from J.L. Turner and Son in 1955.<cite>[S5]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking when Dollar General Corporation changed its name from J.L. Turner and Son. I need to find the correct sentence in the supporting context that answers this.\n\nLooking through the chunks provided, let's scan each sentence. \n\nIn the first part, [S3] mentions that the company began in 1939 as J.L. Turner and Son. Then [S5] says, \"In 1955, the name changed to Dollar General Corporation...\" That seems like the key point. \n\nFurther down, [S21] talks about Cal Turner developing the idea for Dollar General Store in 1955, but the actual name change is mentioned in [S5]. Also, [S23] mentions J.L. Turner died in 1964, but that's after the name change. \n\nSo the answer should be 1955, cited from [S5]. Let me double-check if there's any other mention. The history section under [S9] mentions J.L. Turner and Son: 1939–1964, but the name change happened in 1955 according to [S5]. So the correct citation is [S5]."

[S3] In 2004, Dollar General expanded to low-cost Asian markets by opening a sourcing office in Hong Kong. [S4] On June 21, 2007, CEO David Perdue announced his resignation, leaving David Bere as interim CEO. [S5] One month later, all shares of Dollar General stock were acquired by private equity investors for $22 per share. [S6] An investment group consisting of affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), GS Capital Partners (an affiliate of Goldman Sachs), Citigroup Private Equity, and other co-investors completed an acquisition of Dollar General Corporation for $6.9 billion. [S7] As a part of the transition to a privately held company, Dollar General assessed each location at the end of its lease against a model known as \"EZ Stores\". [S8] This assessment included evaluating whether the location had a loading dock, garbage dumpsters, adequate parking, and acceptable profitability. [S9] Stores that did not pass this evaluation were relocated or closed. [S10] Over 400 stores were closed as part of this initiative. [S11] Dollar General filed on August 20, 2009, for an initial public offering of up to $750 million, turning the company once again into a publicly traded corporation. [S12] In 2013, Dollar General started selling cigarettes in response to its competitor Family Dollar selling cigarettes in 2012. [S13] Dollar General's 12th distribution center opened on May 31, 2014, in Bethel, Pennsylvania, to serve the Northeast and Midwest stores. [S14] On August 18, 2014, Dollar General lodged a competing bid of $9.7 billion against Dollar Tree for Family Dollar. [S15] The bid was rejected on August 20, 2014, by the Family Dollar board, which said it would proceed with the deal with Dollar Tree.

[S18] Dollar General's 13th distribution center opened in San Antonio, Texas, on June 6, 2016, with a local investment of $100 million and the creation of over 500 jobs. [S19] In September 2015, the City Council in Janesville, Wisconsin, approved an agreement to bring a Dollar General distribution center to the town. [S20] The center created more than 500 jobs in the area and became the 14th Dollar General distribution center. [S21] On September 15, 2016, Dollar General announced plans to hire 10,000 new employees and open 900 new stores in fiscal 2016 and 1,000 in fiscal 2017. [S22] Dollar General operated 13,000 stores as of August 2016. [S23] In January 2017, Dollar General opened a concept store in Nashville, Tennessee, called DGX. [S24] The DGX store concept focuses on urban shoppers and is geared toward instant-consumption services such as coffee stations and soda fountains. [S25] The following month another DGX store opened in Raleigh, North Carolina, and in September a third DGX opened in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Scanning through the sentences, S14 says: \"On 12 October 2023, Dollar General announced the return of former CEO Todd Vasos, who replaced Jeff Owen.\" That's the leadership change. But the question is about the reason. So I need to find why they made this change.\n\nThen, looking at S15: \"Chairman Michael Calbert said in a statement, 'At this time the Board has determined that a change in leadership is necessary to restore stability and confidence in the Company moving forward'.\" This seems like the reason. The board felt a leadership change was needed for stability and confidence.\n\nSo the answer should connect S14 and S15. The leadership change happened because the board wanted to restore stability and confidence. The citations would be S14 for the event and S15 for the reason. Let me check if there's any other info. The rest of the context talks about store openings, sponsorships, etc., which don't relate. So the answer is based on those two sentences."

      "answer": "<statement>Dollar General withdrew its sponsorship from NASCAR at the end of the 2016 season.</statement><cite>[S26]</cite>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking about the outcome of Dollar General's sponsorship in NASCAR. I need to look through the provided context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the supporting context for mentions of NASCAR and Dollar General. There's a section labeled \"Auto racing\" and under that, several sentences. Let me go through them one by one.\n\n[S17] mentions \"Major sponsorships\" and then under \"Auto racing,\" it says Dollar General has been connected with motorsports, especially NASCAR. Then [S18] states they were a primary sponsor for Joe Gibbs Racing. [S19] mentions sponsoring Brian Vickers in the Nationwide Series in 2013. [S20] says they became a primary sponsor for Matt Kenseth in the Sprint Cup Series starting 2013. [S21] talks about partnering with Turner (Braun Racing) since 2008. [S22] and [S23] mention sponsoring races in the Truck Series for Kyle Busch Motorsports. [S25] mentions being the title sponsor for Nationwide Series races. Then [S26] says on May 23, 2016, Dollar General announced withdrawing from NASCAR at the end of 2016. \n\nSo the key point here is that Dollar General ended their sponsorship in 2016. The outcome would be that they withdrew their sponsorship. The citation would be [S26]. I need to check if there's any other info about the outcome, but the rest of the sentences talk about their other sponsorships or other events, not the outcome of their NASCAR sponsorship. So the answer is that they withdrew their sponsorship, cited from [S26]."

So, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find any mentions of a bowl game and its previous name.\n\nLooking at the chunks, there's a section under \"Sports\" with sentence S3. Let me check that. S3 says: \"Dollar General became the sponsor of the Dollar General Bowl, formerly the GoDaddy Bowl, in Mobile, Alabama, on August 17, 2016.\" \n\nAh, there it is.

So the answer should be Alaska and Hawaii, cited from [S2]. \n\nThe other sentences: [S3] talks about shutting down self-checkout in 2024, which isn't relevant. The table in [S4] lists states with stores, but it's a table with data as of January 1, 2023. The question is about early 2025, so maybe the table is outdated. The rest of the context is about subsidiaries and controversies, which don't relate to the question. \n\nSo the only relevant sentence is [S2].

S6 mentions municipalities adding zoning laws to discourage them. S7 cites a study saying dollar stores create fewer and lower-wage jobs than independent grocery stores. S8 says the report claims they stifle local competition, hurting the communities. \n\nSo the main reasons from the text are: capitalizing on economic forces, contributing to food deserts, creating lower-wage jobs, and stifling local competition.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking why Dollar General restated its earnings for the previous three fiscal years. I need to look at the supporting context provided.\n\nLooking through the chunks, [S1] mentions that the company restated its earnings due to accounting irregularities including fraudulent behavior. Then [S2] gives more details, saying it was because of a clarification of lease-accounting matters from the SEC. \n\nSo the answer should connect the restatement to the accounting issues. The user might be looking for the main reason, which is the accounting irregularities and fraudulent behavior. But [S2] specifically points to lease-accounting matters clarified by the SEC. However, [S1] is more general. Both sentences [S1] and [S2] are relevant here. \n\nWait, the question is about why they restated, so the answer would be the accounting irregularities and fraudulent behavior mentioned in [S1], and the specific reason in [S2] about lease-accounting. But the user might need both points. However, the answer should be concise. Let me check the exact wording. The user's question is why they restated, so the answer is because of accounting irregularities and fraudulent behavior. But [S2] says it's due to a clarification of lease-accounting matters from the SEC. So maybe both [S1] and [S2] are citations here. \n\nSo the correct citations would be [S1] and [S2]. But the user's answer needs to have the statement with the reason and the citations. So the statement would be \"Dollar General restated its earnings for the previous three fiscal years due to accounting irregularities including allegations of fraudulent behavior and lease-accounting matters clarified by the SEC.\" Then cite [S1][S2]. \n\nWait, but the user's question is why, so the answer is the reasons given in the context. The answer should combine both reasons. But maybe the main reason is the accounting irregularities, and the specific example is the lease-accounting. So the answer would be based on [S1] and [S2].

      "question": "What penalty was proposed by OSHA in 2022 for violations at three Dollar General locations?",
      "answer": "<statement>In 2022, OSHA proposed $1,048,309 in penalties for violations at three Dollar General locations in Mobile, Alabama, and one in Dalton, Georgia.<cite>[S13]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the penalty proposed by OSHA in 2022 for violations at three Dollar General locations. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of OSHA penalties in 2022. The chunk starts with some information about earnings restatements and then moves into OSHA fines. There's a section labeled \"OSHA fines\" with several sentences. \n\nLooking at the sentences, [S3] mentions a fine in 2014, [S8] talks about inspections in 2022 in Pembroke, Hogansville, and Smyrna, but it doesn't mention the penalty amount. Then [S13] says that in February 2022, OSHA proposed $1,048,309 in penalties after inspections at three locations in Mobile, Alabama, and one in Dalton, Georgia. The question specifically mentions three locations, and this sentence mentions three locations (Mobile, Alabama, and one in Dalton, Georgia). Wait, but Mobile has one location and Dalton is another, so that's two? Or maybe the three locations are in Mobile and the one in Dalton? The wording is a bit unclear. However, the key point is that the penalty proposed was $1,048,309. \n\nAnother sentence, [S14], mentions a December 2021 inspection leading to $321,827 in penalties, but that's 2021, not 2022. The question is about 2022. So [S13] is the relevant one here. The answer should be the $1,048,309 penalty. The citation would be [S13]. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other sentence. Let me check again. [S8] mentions inspections in 2022 but doesn't state the penalty. [S13] is the one that specifies the penalty amount. So the answer is $1,048,309 with citation [S13]."

Looking through the rest, [S3] talks about OSHA fines, but not a specific program. Other sentences mention inspections and citations, but nothing else about a program. \n\nThe key sentence here is [S15], which explicitly states the addition to the severe-violator enforcement program.
