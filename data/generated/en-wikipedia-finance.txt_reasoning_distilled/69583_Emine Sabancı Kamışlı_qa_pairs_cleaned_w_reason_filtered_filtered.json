  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Emine Sabancı Kamışlı in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main points seem to be her background as a Turkish billionaire, part of the Sabancı family, co-founder of Esas Group, her education, career path, and personal life. The document mentions her early years, education at LSE, work at Willis Towers Watson, her roles at Aksigorta and Sabancı Holding, then leaving to co-found Esas Holding. Also, her marriage and children.\n\nI should focus on the main topic, which is her as a businesswoman and her key roles. The key concepts are her family heritage, education, career moves, and current position. I need to make sure to include her co-founding Esas Group, her roles in family companies, and maybe her current position as vice-chair. Also, mention her education and early career. Avoid minor details like the exact years unless they're crucial. Keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Let me check if I missed anything. The document also notes she's a third-generation member, which is important. Maybe start with her name, birth year, family, and main business role. Then her education and career progression, then her current role. Personal life can be a sentence at the end. Let me structure that.\n</think>\n\nEmine Sabancı Kamışlı, born in 1966, is a Turkish billionaire and third-generation member of the influential Sabancı family, known for co-founding Esas Group, a multi-billion-dollar alternative investment firm. She studied economics at the London School of Economics, worked at Willis Towers Watson, and rose to CEO of her family's insurance company Aksigorta before co-founding Esas Holding with her father in 2001, where she currently serves as vice-chair. Her career reflects a blend of family legacy and independent business leadership, alongside her role as a philanthropist. She is married with two sons.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking what job Emine Sabancı Kamışlı held after graduating from university. So first, I need to look through the supporting context provided.\n\nThe passage starts by mentioning she studied economics at the London School of Economics from 1984 to 1987. Then it says she worked at Willis Towers Watson for two years as an analyst. After that, when she returned to Turkey, she started working at her family's insurance company Aksigorta and became CEO. Then she co-founded Esas Holding later on.\n\nSo the key points here are her education, then her job at Willis Towers Watson, then Aksigorta. The question is about the job after university. The timeline seems to be: after graduating (1987), she worked at Willis Towers Watson for two years. Then after returning to Turkey, she joined Aksigorta. But the question is specifically about the job after university. So the immediate job after graduation would be the analyst role at Willis Towers Watson. However, I need to check if there's any other information. The answer might be that she worked at Willis Towers Watson as an analyst. Let me check the citations. The sentences about her education are S4 and S5. The work at Willis Towers Watson is S6. Then S7 mentions her starting at Aksigorta. So the answer would be the analyst position at Willis Towers Watson. But I need to make sure there's no other job mentioned between graduation and that. The passage says she studied from 1984-1987, then worked at Willis for two years. So after graduation in 1987, she worked there. Then after that, she went back to Turkey and joined Aksigorta. So the answer is the analyst job. The citations would be S5 (for graduating) and S6 (for the job). Wait, but the question is about the job after university, so the answer is the analyst role. So the statement would be \"She worked in Willis Towers Watson for two years as an analyst.\" with citation [S6]. But maybe also mention that she studied economics at LSE, but the question is about the job after graduation. So the answer is the analyst position. Let me confirm the sentences again. Yes, S6 is the job after her studies. So the answer is that she worked as an analyst at Willis Towers Watson. The citations would be [S6]. But maybe also [S5] since that's her education. However, the question is about the job, so only [S6]. Wait, the user's instructions say to cite the sentences that support the answer. So if the answer is the job at Willis Towers Watson, then [S6]. But the user might need to know that she graduated first. However, the question is specifically about the job after university, so the answer is the analyst role. So the statement would be \"Emine Sabancı Kamışlı worked as an analyst at Willis Towers Watson for two years after graduating from university.\" with citation [S6]. But the original passage says \"She then worked in Willis Towers Watson for two years as an analyst.\" So the sentence is S6. Therefore, the answer is that she held the position of analyst at Willis Towers Watson. So the correct citation is [S6]."

I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nLooking at the passage, there's a section titled \"Career\" and then under that, there's a part about her co-founding Esas Holding. The relevant sentence here is [S10], which states she is currently the vice-chair of Esas Holding. \n\nI should check if there are any other sentences that mention her role. The other sentences talk about her being a co-founder, but the current role is specifically mentioned in [S10]. The rest of the context includes her early life, education, and personal life, which aren't relevant here. \n\nSo the answer should be that she is the vice-chair, cited from [S10]. I need to make sure there are no other citations. The user's format requires each statement to have its citations. Since the answer is in one sentence, it's straightforward."

I need to look through the supporting context provided.\n\nLooking at the passage, there's a sentence that says: \"She is the co-founder of Esas Group, a multi billion dollar alternative investment firm based in Istanbul, Turkey, and London, UK.\" That's sentence S2. So the key part here is \"alternative investment firm.\" \n\nAnother part mentions Esas Holding in S9: \"In 2001, Kamışlı quit her roles at Sabancı Holding, and co-founded Esas Holding with her father Şevket Sabancı.\" But the question is about Esas Group, not Esas Holding. Wait, are they the same? The names are similar. The first mention is Esas Group, then later Esas Holding. Maybe they are related or the same company. The user might be referring to Esas Group, but the context mentions Esas Holding. However, since the question is about Esas Group, I should check if there's any other info. \n\nThe rest of the context talks about her career, but the only direct description of Esas Group is in S2. So the answer would be that Esas Group is an alternative investment firm. The citation would be S2. I don't see any other sentences that describe the company type. Even though S9 mentions Esas Holding, it doesn't specify the type. So the answer is based on S2."
