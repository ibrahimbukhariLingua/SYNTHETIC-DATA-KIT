  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the document carefully.\n\nThe main points seem to be that the GPA is a WTO plurilateral agreement regulating public procurement with principles like openness, transparency, and non-discrimination. It was established in 1979, revised in 1994 and 2012, and came into effect in 2014, applying since 2021. The parties include various WTO members, with some having observer status. The agreement has appendices detailing coverage, and there's a Review Body for bid challenges. Also, the UK's membership post-Brexit is mentioned.\n\nI should focus on the main topic, which is the GPA itself, its purpose, key principles, history, parties, and key features like the Review Body. Need to mention the principles of non-discrimination and transparency, the evolution of the agreement, the list of parties, and the structure with appendices. Also, the UK's situation after Brexit is a notable point. But since the user wants 3-5 sentences, I need to be concise. Let me check if I missed any key concepts. The coverage through appendices and the Review Body are important. Maybe combine the key principles and the structure. Avoid too many details on the parties list. Highlight the main elements without getting into the specific dates and countries unless necessary. Make sure to mention the purpose, key principles, history, and the Review Body. Also, note that it's a plurilateral agreement, not all WTO members are part of it. Okay, time to put it all together concisely.\n</think>\n\nThe **Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA)** is a WTO plurilateral agreement promoting open, transparent, and non-discriminatory public procurement practices among its parties. Established in 1979 and revised in 1994 and 2012, it binds member states to specific procurement rules, with each country's Appendix 1 detailing coverage of government entities and sectors. Key features include a Review Body for bid challenges and principles of fairness, alongside a growing list of participants, including the UK post-Brexit. Observer status is held by several WTO members seeking accession, reflecting its global relevance in trade and public procurement standards.",

[S2] The agreement was originally established in 1979 as the \"Tokyo Round Government Procurement Code\", which entered into force in 1981 under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. [S3] It was then renegotiated in parallel with the Uruguay Round in 1994, and this version entered into force on 1 January 1996. [S4] The text adopted in 1996 anticipated that there would be subsequent improvements. [S5] An understanding on the expected revisions was reached in December 2006, and the agreement was subsequently revised on 30 March 2012. [S6] The revised GPA came into effect on 6 July 2014 and has applied since 1 January 2021 to all members.

[S8] ## Main principles\n\nThe WTO states that the two \"cornerstone\" principles underlying the agreement are non-discrimination (in regard to the treatment of the goods and services from, and suppliers of, any other party to the agreement) and transparency. [S9] ## Coverage\n\nProcuring entities bound by the Agreement vary by member state. [S10] Each member state has its own Appendix 1 which forms an integral part of the Agreement detailing how the agreement applies to their national procurement activities. [S11] Each Appendix 1 has seven annexes:\n\n* Annex 1: central government entities covered by the Agreement\n* Annex 2: sub-central government entities covered by the Agreement\n* Annex 3: other entities covered by the Agreement\n* Annex 4: scope: goods\n* Annex 5: scope: services\n* Annex 6: scope: construction services\n* Annex 7: general notes.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking when the GPA was originally established and when it entered into force. So first, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the chunks, the first mention of the GPA is in [S1], but that's just the title. Then in [S2], there's a sentence that says, \"The agreement was originally established in 1979 as the 'Tokyo Round Government Procurement Code', which entered into force in 1981 under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\" That seems to answer both parts of the question. The original establishment year is 1979, and it entered into force in 1981. \n\nI should check if there's any other information in other sentences that might add more context or conflicting dates. For example, [S3] mentions renegotiation in 1994 and entry into force in 1996, but that's about a later version. The question is about the original establishment, so [S2] is the key here. \n\nThe other sentences like [S5][S6][S7] talk about later revisions and effective dates, but those are not relevant to the original establishment. The answer should be based on [S2]. So the statement would be that the GPA was established in 1979 and entered into force in 1981, citing [S2]. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other citations. The user's example shows that each sentence has its own citations. So the answer should be a single statement with [S2] as the citation. Let me structure that properly."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking when the GPA was renegotiated and when the revised version entered into force. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of renegotiation and dates. Starting from the beginning, [S1] introduces the GPA. Then [S2] talks about the original establishment in 1979 and entry into force in 1981. [S3] mentions that it was renegotiated in parallel with the Uruguay Round in 1994, and the version entered into force on 1 January 1996. That seems like a key point. \n\nFurther down, [S5] states that an understanding on revisions was reached in December 2006, and the agreement was revised on 30 March 2012. Then [S6] says the revised GPA came into effect on 6 July 2014 and applied since 1 January 2021. Wait, the question is about when the revised version entered into force. The user might be asking about the most recent revision, but the question doesn't specify which revision. However, the first renegotiation was in 1994, leading to 1996, and then the 2012 revision leading to 2014. \n\nBut the question says \"the revised version\"—maybe referring to the latest one. However, the user might be asking about the initial renegotiation. Let me check the exact wording. The question is \"When was the GPA renegotiated, and when did the revised version enter into force?\" So \"renegotiated\" could refer to any renegotiation. But the passage mentions two instances: 1994 and 2012. However, the first renegotiation in 1994 led to the 1996 entry into force. The 2012 revision entered into force in 2014. \n\nBut the user might be asking about the most recent one. However, the question doesn't specify. But looking at the context, the answer should include both instances. Wait, the question is phrased as \"the GPA renegotiated\" (singular) and \"the revised version\" (singular). So maybe they are referring to the latest revision. But the passage mentions that the 1994 renegotiation led to the 1996 version, and then the 2012 revision led to 2014. However, the 2014 version was then applied since 2021. \n\nWait, [S6] says \"The revised GPA came into effect on 6 July 2014 and has applied since 1 January 2021 to all members.\" So the 2014 date is when it came into effect, but the application was extended to all members from 2021. But the question is about when the revised version entered into force, which would be 2014. However, the user might be asking about the initial renegotiation. But the question isn't clear. However, based on the passage, there are two renegotiations: 1994 and 2012. \n\nBut the answer needs to be based on the context. The user's question is likely referring to the most recent one, but the passage doesn't specify. However, the way the question is phrased, \"the GPA renegotiated\" could refer to any renegotiation. But the answer should cover all instances. However, the user might be looking for the two dates: 1994 renegotiated, 1996 entered into force; and 2012 renegotiated, 2014 entered into force. But the question is phrased as \"when was the GPA renegotiated, and when did the revised version enter into force?\" So maybe the answer is that it was renegotiated in 1994 and the revised version entered into force in 1996, and then again in 2012 with entry into force in 2014. But the user might be asking for the latest. \n\nBut according to the passage, the answer should include both. However, the user's question might be referring to the most recent. But the question isn't specific. However, the supporting context has two instances. Let me check the exact sentences again. \n\n[S3] says \"renegotiated in parallel with the Uruguay Round in 1994, and this version entered into force on 1 January 1996.\" [S5] mentions \"revised on 30 March 2012\" and [S6] says \"came into effect on 6 July 2014.\" So the answer would need to state both renegotiation dates and their respective entry into force dates. But the question is phrased as \"when was the GPA renegotiated\" (singular) and \"when did the revised version enter into force\" (singular). So maybe the user is referring to the most recent one. However, the question isn't clear. But given the context, the answer should include both instances. \n\nBut the user might be expecting the answer to mention both. However, the way the question is structured, it's possible that the answer is the 1994 renegotiation and 1996 entry, and the 2012 renegotiation and 2014 entry. But the user's question might be looking for the latest. However, without more context, I should present both. \n\nBut the answer needs to be accurate. The user's question is: \"When was the GPA renegotiated, and when did the revised version enter into force?\" So the answer would be that the GPA was renegotiated in 1994, and the revised version entered into force on 1 January 1996. Additionally, it was revised again in 2012, entering into force on 6 July 2014. However, the question might be referring to the most recent one. But the user might not know that there were multiple renegotiations. \n\nBut according to the passage, the answer should include both. However, the user's question uses \"the revised version,\" which could imply the latest one. But the passage mentions that the 1996 version was later revised in 2012. So the answer would need to state both instances. However, the user might be asking for the most recent. \n\nBut the answer must be based on the context. The passage has two renegotiations: 1994 and 2012. So the answer should mention both. But the user's question is phrased as \"the GPA renegotiated\" (singular) and \"the revised version\" (singular). Maybe the user is referring to the latest one. However, the answer should be accurate. \n\nIn the absence of more specific information, I'll present both instances. So the answer would be that the GPA was renegotiated in 1994, and the revised version entered into force on 1 January 1996. Additionally, it was revised again in 2012, with the revised version entering into force on 6 July 2014. But the user's question might be looking for the 1994 and 1996 dates. However, the passage also mentions the 2012 and 2014 dates. \n\nBut the user's question is not specific. However, the answer should be based on the context. Therefore, the answer should include both renegotiation dates and their respective entry into force dates. However, the user might have intended the first renegotiation. But since the passage mentions both, I need to include both. \n\nBut the way the question is phrased, \"the GPA renegotiated\" could be referring to any renegotiation. So the answer should state both. However, the user might be expecting the answer to mention both. Therefore, the answer would be:\n\nThe GPA was renegotiated in 1994, and the revised version entered into force on 1 January 1996. It was also revised again in 2012, with the revised version entering into force on 6 July 2014.\n\nBut the user's question might be looking for the most recent. However, without explicit clarification, I should present all relevant information. \n\nNow, checking the citations. The 1994 renegotiation and 1996 entry is [S3]. The 2012 revision and 2014 entry is [S5] and [S6]. So the citations would be [S3] for the first part, and [S5][S6] for the second part. However, the user's question is asking for both when it was renegotiated and when the revised version entered into force. So the answer would have two statements: one about 1994 and 1996, and another about 2012 and 2014. \n\nBut the user's question is phrased as a single question, so the answer should combine both. However, the response format requires each sentence to be in <statement> tags with citations. So I need to structure it accordingly."

      "answer": "<statement>The two cornerstone principles of the GPA are non-discrimination and transparency.<cite>[S9]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the two cornerstone principles of the GPA. The supporting context provided is the passage about the Agreement on Government Procurement.\n\nFirst, I need to scan through the passage to find where the principles are mentioned. The user mentioned that the answer should be based on the supporting context, so I can't use any outside knowledge. \n\nLooking at the passage, there's a section titled \"Main principles\". Let me check that. The sentence there says: \"The WTO states that the two 'cornerstone' principles underlying the agreement are non-discrimination (in regard to the treatment of the goods and services from, and suppliers of, any other party to the agreement) and transparency.\" \n\nSo that sentence directly mentions the two principles: non-discrimination and transparency. The citation for this sentence is [S9]. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of principles elsewhere. The first sentence mentions \"openness, transparency and non-discrimination\" but that's in the context of the GPA's regulations. However, the question specifically asks for the two cornerstone principles, which the \"Main principles\" section clearly states as non-discrimination and transparency. \n\nSo the answer should be those two terms, cited from [S9]. The other sentences don't mention the cornerstone principles, so no other citations are needed. The user wants each sentence in <statement> tags with citations. Since the answer is two principles, I need to split them into two sentences? Wait, the question is asking for the two principles, so maybe one sentence listing both. Let me check the example response again.\n\nIn the example, they have two sentences, each with their own citations. But in this case, the two principles are in the same sentence. So I should have one statement with both principles and the citation [S9]. \n\nWait, the user's example shows that each sentence is a separate statement. So if the answer is two principles mentioned in one sentence, then that's one statement with the citation. But if they need to be separate, maybe split them. But the original sentence combines them. So I should present them as they are. \n\nSo the correct answer is: The two cornerstone principles are non-discrimination and transparency, cited from [S9]. So the statement would be \"<statement>The two cornerstone principles of the GPA are non-discrimination and transparency.<cite>[S9]</cite></statement>\".\n\nI need to make sure there's no other citations. The other parts of the text mention transparency in other contexts, but the main principles section is the only one that explicitly states them as the cornerstone. So that's the only citation needed."

Let me look through the supporting context provided.\n\nFirst, I see that in sentence S1, it says each member state has its own Appendix 1 which is an integral part of the Agreement, detailing how the agreement applies to their national procurement activities. That seems directly relevant. So the role here is that Appendix 1 is part of the Agreement and explains the application to national procurement.\n\nThen, in S2, there's a list of seven annexes under each Appendix 1. But the question is about Appendix 1 itself, not the annexes. However, maybe the annexes are part of Appendix 1? The wording says \"Each Appendix 1 has seven annexes,\" so Appendix 1 includes these annexes. But the question is about the role of Appendix 1, not the annexes. So the main point is that Appendix 1 is part of the Agreement and details the application to national procurement. \n\nThe other sentences talk about the Review Body and UK membership, which don't seem related to Appendix 1. So the answer should be based on S1. But wait, S2 mentions that Appendix 1 has annexes, but that's more about the structure rather than the role. The role is defined in S1. So the answer is that Appendix 1 forms an integral part of the Agreement and details how the agreement applies to national procurement activities. The citation would be S1. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention. Let me check again. S3-S8 are about the Review Body and UK membership, which are unrelated. So the only citation is S1.
