  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document on quality management in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content to identify the main topics and key concepts.\n\nThe document begins by defining quality management as ensuring consistent performance of an organization, product, or service, with four components: planning, assurance, control, and improvement. It mentions that quality is important for both customers and suppliers, influencing their choices and competitiveness.\n\nNext, there's a section on the evolution of quality management, starting from historical practices like Eli Whitney's interchangeable parts and Frederick Taylor's scientific management. It highlights the role of Shewhart and Deming in developing statistical quality control, and how Japan's focus on quality post-WWII led to improvements, influencing Western companies.\n\nThe principles section outlines the ISO 9001:2015 standards with seven management principles like customer focus, leadership, and continuous improvement. There's also mention of various quality improvement methods like Six Sigma, Kaizen, and TQM, along with their applications and challenges.\n\nThe document also covers quality standards like ISO 9000, specific industry standards (e.g., ISO 13485 for medical devices), and other frameworks like CMMI. It discusses quality management software and terms like quality improvement versus control.\n\nNow, to condense this. The main points are: definition and components of quality management, historical development, key principles (ISO standards), methods for improvement, and related standards/software. I need to make sure each sentence captures a major aspect without getting too detailed. Avoid mentioning specific examples unless they're crucial. Focus on the core concepts and their significance.\n</think>\n\nQuality management ensures consistent product and service performance through planning, assurance, control, and improvement, emphasizing customer satisfaction and competitive differentiation. It evolved from historical practices like scientific management and statistical control, with key contributions from figures like Deming and Japan's post-WWII quality focus, leading to global standards like ISO 9001. Core principles include customer focus, leadership, process optimization, and continuous improvement, supported by methodologies such as Six Sigma, TQM, and Kaizen. The field also addresses challenges like cultural resistance and integrates with software solutions and industry-specific standards to enhance efficiency and compliance.",

[S3] ## Evolution\n\nQuality management is a recent phenomenon but important for an organization. [S4] Civilizations that supported arts and crafts\u1d9c\u02e1\u1d43\u02b3\u2071\u1da0\u2071\u1d9c\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 allowed clients to choose goods meeting higher quality standards than normal goods. [S5] In societies where arts and crafts were the responsibility of master craftsmen or artists, these masters would lead studios and train and supervise others. [S6] However, the importance of craftsmen diminished as mass production and repetitive work practices were instituted. [S7] This approach aimed to produce large numbers of the same goods. [S8] The first proponent in the United States for this approach was Eli Whitney, who proposed interchangeable parts manufacture for muskets, hence producing identical components and creating a musket assembly line. [S9] The next step forward was promoted by several people, including Frederick Winslow Taylor, a mechanical engineer who sought to improve industrial efficiency. [S10] He is sometimes called \"the father of scientific management\". [S11] He was one of the intellectual leaders of the Efficiency Movement and part of his approach laid a further foundation for quality management, including aspects like standardization and adopting improved practices. [S12] Henry Ford was also important in bringing process and quality management practices into operation in his assembly lines. [S13] In Germany, Karl Benz, often called the inventor of the motor car, was pursuing similar assembly and production practices, although real mass production was only properly initiated in Volkswagen after World War II. [S14] From this period onward, North American companies focused predominantly on production against lower cost with increased efficiency. [S15] Walter A. [S16] Shewhart made a major step in the evolution towards quality management by creating a method for quality control for production, using statistical methods, first proposed in 1924. [S17] This became the foundation for his ongoing work on statistical quality control. [S18] W. [S19] Edwards Deming later applied statistical quality control methods in the United States during World War II, thereby successfully improving quality in the manufacture of munitions and other strategically important products. [S20] Quality leadership from a national perspective has changed over the past decades. [S21] After World War II, Japan decided to make quality improvement a national imperative as part of rebuilding their economy, and sought the help of Shewhart, Deming, and Juran, among others. [S22] W. [S23] Edwards Deming championed Shewhart's ideas in Japan from 1950 onwards. [S24] He is probably best known for his management philosophy establishing quality, productivity, and competitive position. [S25] He has formulated 14 points of attention for managers, which are a high-level abstraction of many of his insights. [S26] They should be interpreted by learning and understanding the insights. [S27] These 14 points include key concepts such as:\n\n* Break down barriers between departments\n* Management should learn their responsibilities, and take on leadership\n* Supervision should be to help people and machines and gadgets to do a better job\n* Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service\n* Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement\n* Drive out fear so that everyone may work effectively for the company",

[S4] For example, Japanese cars regularly top the J.D. [S5] Power customer satisfaction ratings. [S6] In the 1980s, Deming was asked by Ford Motor Company to start a quality initiative after they realized that they were falling behind Japanese manufacturers. [S7] A number of highly successful quality initiatives have been invented by the Japanese (see for example on these pages: Genichi Taguchi, QFD, Toyota Production System). [S8] Many of the methods provide techniques and have associated quality culture (i.e. [S9] people factors). [S10] These methods are now adopted by the same Western countries that decades earlier derided Japanese methods. [S11] Customers recognize that quality is an important attribute when choosing and purchasing products and services. [S12] Suppliers can recognize that quality is an important differentiator between their offerings and those of competitors, and endeavor to compete on the quality of their products and the service they offer. [S13] David A. [S14] Garvin's 1987 article in the *Harvard Business Review*, \"Competing on the Eight Dimensions of Quality\", noted that few companies had learned to \"compete on quality\", but in the past two decades\u02b7\u02b0\u1d49\u207f?, the extent of such quality differentiation, or the \"quality gap\", has been greatly reduced between competitive products and services. [S15] This is partly due to the contracting (also called outsourcing) of manufacturing to countries like China and India, as well internationalization of trade and competition. [S16] These countries, among many others, have raised their standards of quality to meet international standards and customer demands. [S17] The ISO 9000 series of standards are probably the best known International standards for quality management. [S18] Some themes have become more significant, including quality culture, the importance of knowledge management, and the role of leadership in promoting and achieving high quality. [S19] Disciplines like systems thinking are bringing more holistic approaches to quality so that people, processes, and products are considered together rather than independent factors in quality management. [S20] Government agencies and industrial organizations that regulate products have recognized that quality culture may assist companies that produce those products. [S21] A survey of more than 60 multinational companies found that those companies whose employees rated as having a low-quality culture had increased costs of $67 million/year for every 5000 employees compared to those rated as having a strong-quality culture. [S22] The influence of quality thinking has spread to non-traditional applications outside of walls of manufacturing, extending into service sectors and into areas such as sales, marketing and customer service.

[S4] Customer satisfaction has been the backbone of quality management and still is important. [S5] However, there is an expansion of the research focus from a sole customer focus towards a stakeholder focus. [S6] This is following the development of stakeholder theory. [S7] A further development of quality management is the exploration of synergies between quality management and sustainable development. [S8] ## Principles\n\nThe International Standard for Quality Management (ISO 9001:2015) adopts seven management principles, that can be used by top management to guide their organizations towards improved performance. [S9] ### Customer focus\n\nThe primary focus of quality management is to meet customer requirement and to strive to exceed customer expectations. [S10] **Rationale**\n\nSustained success is achieved when an organization attracts and retains the confidence of customers and other interested parties on whom it depends. [S11] Every aspect of customer interaction provides an opportunity to create more value for the customer. [S12] Understanding current and future needs of customers and other interested parties contributes to the sustained success of an organization As customers become more discerning, they seek companies that fulfill their needs and exceed their expectations. [S13] Consequently, Quality Management (QM) plays a significant role in shaping company performance and satisfaction among customers and other stakeholders. [S14] ### Leadership\n\nLeaders at all levels establish unity of purpose and direction and create conditions in which people are engaged in achieving the organization's quality objectives. [S15] Leadership has to take up the necessary changes required for quality improvement and encourage a sense of quality throughout the organization. [S16] **Rationale**\n\nThe creation of unity of purpose and direction and engagement of people enable an organization to align its strategies, policies, processes, and resources to achieve its objectives. [S17] ### Engagement of people\n\nCompetent, empowered, and engaged people at all levels throughout the organization are essential to enhance its capability to create and deliver value. [S18] **Rationale**\n\nTo manage an organization effectively and efficiently, it is important to involve all people at all levels and to respect them as individuals. [S19] Recognition, empowerment, and enhancement of competence facilitate the engagement of people in achieving the organization's quality objectives. [S20] ### Process approach\n\nConsistent and predictable results are achieved more effectively and efficiently when activities are understood and managed as interrelated processes that function as a coherent system. [S21] **Rationale**\n\nThe quality management system consists of interrelated processes. [S22] Understanding how results are produced by this system enables an organization to optimize the system and its performance. [S23] ### Improvement\n\nSuccessful organizations have an ongoing focus on improvement. [S24] **Rationale**\n\nImprovement is essential for an organization to maintain current levels of performance, to react to changes in its internal and external conditions, and to create new opportunities. [S25] ### Evidence-based decision-making\n\nDecisions based on the analysis and evaluation of data and information are more likely to produce desired results. [S26] **Rationale**",
      "question": "What is the annual cost difference for multinational companies with low-quality culture compared to those with strong-quality culture per 5000 employees?",
      "answer": "<statement>The annual cost difference for multinational companies with low-quality culture compared to those with strong-quality culture is $67 million per year for every 5000 employees.<cite>[S1]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the annual cost difference for multinational companies with low-quality culture compared to those with strong-quality culture per 5000 employees. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The passage has several sentences labeled from [S1] to [S26]. The question is about the cost difference, so I should focus on sentences that mention costs or financial impacts.\n\nLooking at [S1], it says, \"A survey of more than 60 multinational companies found that those companies whose employees rated as having a low-quality culture had increased costs of $67 million/year for every 5000 employees compared to those rated as having a strong-quality culture.\" That seems directly relevant. The key numbers here are $67 million per year for every 5000 employees. The question is asking exactly for this figure, so this sentence is the main source.\n\nI should check if any other sentences mention costs. Scanning through the rest, [S3] talks about correlation between quality culture and competitive advantage, but no numbers. [S13] mentions customer satisfaction and company performance, but again, no specific costs. The rest of the sentences discuss principles of quality management, customer focus, leadership, etc., but not financial differences. \n\nSo the answer is in [S1]. The user wants the annual cost difference, which is $67 million per 5000 employees. The citation should be [S1]. I need to make sure there are no other citations. The answer is straightforward here. No other sentences provide this specific data. Therefore, the statement should reference [S1]."

[S2] The influence of quality thinking has spread to non-traditional applications outside of walls of manufacturing, extending into service sectors and into areas such as sales, marketing and customer service. [S3] Statistical evidence collected in the banking sector shows a strong correlation between quality culture and competitive advantage. [S4] Customer satisfaction has been the backbone of quality management and still is important. [S5] However, there is an expansion of the research focus from a sole customer focus towards a stakeholder focus. [S6] This is following the development of stakeholder theory. [S7] A further development of quality management is the exploration of synergies between quality management and sustainable development. [S8] ## Principles\n\nThe International Standard for Quality Management (ISO 9001:2015) adopts seven management principles, that can be used by top management to guide their organizations towards improved performance. [S9] ### Customer focus\n\nThe primary focus of quality management is to meet customer requirement and to strive to exceed customer expectations. [S10] **Rationale**\n\nSustained success is achieved when an organization attracts and retains the confidence of customers and other interested parties on whom it depends. [S11] Every aspect of customer interaction provides an opportunity to create more value for the customer.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking how many management principles the ISO 9001:2015 standard adopts for quality management. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nLooking at the chunks, there's a section labeled [S8] with the heading \"Principles\" and the text says, \"The International Standard for Quality Management (ISO 9001:2015) adopts seven management principles, that can be used by top management to guide their organizations towards improved performance.\" So that seems to directly answer the question. The number seven is mentioned here. \n\nI should check if there are any other mentions of the number of principles elsewhere. The rest of the context goes into each principle like Customer focus, Leadership, Engagement of people, Process approach, Improvement, Evidence-based decision-making, etc. But the specific number is given in [S8]. The other sentences talk about the principles but don't state the count. So the answer is seven, and the citation is [S8]."

[S3] **Rationale**\n\nDecision-making can be a complex process, and it always involves some uncertainty.

[S8] **Rationale**\n\nInterested parties influence the performance of an organization and industry. [S9] Sustained success is more likely to be achieved when the organization manages relationships with all of its interested parties to optimize their impact on its performance.

S1 says: \"Improvement is essential for an organization to maintain current levels of performance, to react to changes in its internal and external conditions, and to create new opportunities.\" That seems like a direct answer to the question. The question is asking for the reasons given in the text, so this sentence probably contains the main points.\n\nAre there other sentences that add to this? Let me check the rest. The next sections talk about evidence-based decision-making, relationship management, criticism of Quality Management, and quality improvement methods. But the question is specifically about why improvement is essential, so the key part is in S1. \n\nThe user wants citations, so I need to make sure to cite S1. The answer should be a statement that includes the reasons from S1, and cite [S1]. Let me verify if there's any other sentence that might be relevant. For example, S9 mentions sustained success through relationship management, but that's about relationship management, not improvement in general. The other sentences either discuss decision-making or criticism, which don't directly answer the question. \n\nSo the answer is based on S1. The statement should be a paraphrase of S1's content, and cite [S1]. I need to make sure the response follows the format with <statement> and <cite> tags. No other citations are needed here."

[S28] Many of the changes were to improve consistency in grammar, facilitating translation of the standard into other languages for use by over 950,000 certified organizations in the 175 countries (as at Dec 2007) that use the standard.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking which ISO standard integrated the previous ISO 9002 and ISO 9003 into a single certifiable standard. I need to look through the supporting context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of ISO 9002 and 9003. Looking at the sentences, S20 mentions the original ISO 9000:1987 series including 9001, 9002, and 9003. Then S24 talks about a major revision in 2000 called ISO 9000:2000 series. Then S24 specifically states that ISO 9002 and 9003 were integrated into one standard: ISO 9001:2000. \n\nSo the answer should be ISO 9001:2000. The citation here is S24. Let me check if there's any other sentence that might also be relevant. S25 mentions the transition after 2003, but the actual integration is in S24. So the correct citation is S24."

[S4] The ISO 9004:2009 document gives guidelines for performance improvement over and above the basic standard (ISO 9001:2000). [S5] This standard provides a measurement framework for improved quality management, similar to and based upon the measurement framework for process assessment. [S6] The last major revision was published on 15 September 2015. [S7] This change adopted the High-Level Structure, contained in ISO Directive 1 Annex SL, for the first time. [S8] The Quality Management System standards created by ISO are meant for certification of the processes and management arrangements of an organization, not the product or service itself. [S9] The ISO 9000 family of standards does not set out requirements for product or service approval. [S10] Instead, ISO 9001 requires that product or service requirements are agreed between the organization and its customers and that the organization manages its business processes to achieve these agreed requirements. [S11] ISO 9001 states that the Quality Management System requirements of the standard are generic and are intended to be applicable to any organization, regardless of its type or size, or the products and services it provides, however, ISO has also published separate standards which specify Quality Management System requirements for specific industries. [S12] These included those related to the production or processing of goods typically regulated by nations and other global jurisdictions, to ensure that unique elements pertaining to public health and safety are integrated into these Quality Management Systems. [S13] ISO 13485 specifies Quality Management System requirements for organizations involved in the design and manufacture of medical devices to demonstrate the ability to meet relevant regulatory requirements. [S14] Such organizations can be involved in one or more stages of the life cycle, including design and development, production, storage and distribution, installation, or servicing of a medical device, and design and development or provision of associated activities (e.g. [S15] technical support). [S16] ISO 13485 can also be used by suppliers or external parties that provide products, including quality management system-related services, to such organizations. [S17] ISO has not published a standard in a similar manner specifying Quality Management System requirements unique to the pharmaceutical industry for regulatory purposes, therefore compliance with ISO 9001 is typically utilized by organizations involved in the design and manufacture of pharmaceuticals. [S18] In 2005 ISO published ISO 22000 specifying the Food Safety Management System requirements for the food industry. [S19] This standard covers the values and principles of ISO 9000 and the HACCP standards. [S20] It gives one single integrated standard for the food industry, defining requirements for any organization in the food chain. [S21] Technical Standard TS 16949 defines requirements in addition to those in ISO 9001:2008 specifically for the automotive industry. [S22] ISO has standards that support quality management. [S23] One group describes processes (including ISO/IEC 12207 and ISO/IEC 15288) and another describes process assessment and improvement, ISO 15504.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking about the purpose of the ISO 9001:2008 revision according to the text. I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the relevant sentences.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through each sentence. Sentence S1 mentions that ISO 9001:2008 was a minor revision released in 2008. S2 says it contains no new requirements. Then S3 states that many changes were to improve consistency in grammar to facilitate translation into other languages for use by over 950,000 certified organizations in 175 countries. That seems relevant. \n\nOther sentences like S4 and S5 talk about ISO 9004:2009 and performance improvement, but that's a different document. S6 mentions the last major revision in 2015, which is about a different update. S7 talks about High-Level Structure, but that's for a later revision. The other sentences discuss other standards like ISO 13485, 22000, TS 16949, etc., which are separate. \n\nSo the main point about the 2008 revision's purpose is in S3. The answer should be that the purpose was to improve consistency in grammar to aid translation, allowing the standard to be used by many organizations globally. The citation would be S3. Let me check again to make sure there's no other relevant info. No, other sentences don't mention the purpose of the 2008 revision. So the answer is based on S3."

Each of them is listed with their respective descriptions. The citations here would be [S11], but I need to check if each bullet point has its own citation. However, in the context provided, each bullet point is part of the same sentence [S11]. So the entire list is under [S11]. \n\nWait, looking at the text again, the line after [S11] is the list. So the three constellations are mentioned in [S11]. Therefore, the correct citation for each of the three constellations would be [S11]. \n\nBut the user wants each sentence with its citations. The answer would be three sentences, each listing one constellation, all citing [S11]. However, in the original context, the three constellations are listed as bullet points under [S11]. So each bullet is part of the same sentence? Or are they separate sentences? \n\nLooking at the structure, the text says: [S11] Three constellations of CMMI are:\n\n* Product and service development (CMMI for Development). [S12] * Service establishment, management, and delivery (CMMI for Services). [S13] * Product and service acquisition (CMMI for Acquisition). [S14] \n\nWait, actually, each bullet point has its own sentence. So [S11] starts the sentence, then the first bullet is [S12], the second [S13], and the third [S14]. But that might not be accurate. Let me check again.\n\nThe original text in the chunk is:\n\n[S11] Three constellations of CMMI are:\n\n* Product and service development (CMMI for Development). [S12] * Service establishment, management, and delivery (CMMI for Services). [S13] * Product and service acquisition (CMMI for Acquisition). [S14] \n\nSo it seems like each bullet point is a separate sentence with its own citation. So the first bullet is [S12], the second [S13], and the third [S14]. But the initial part \"Three constellations of CMMI are:\" is in [S11]. However, the way it's written, the bullets are part of the same sentence? Or are they separate sentences?\n\nThis is a bit confusing. If each bullet is a separate sentence, then each would have their own citation. But the way the text is structured, the bullets are part of the same sentence. However, in the given context, each bullet is followed by a sentence number. For example, the first bullet ends with [S12], which might indicate that the bullet point is part of sentence [S12]. But that's not standard. Typically, each bullet would be a separate sentence. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire list is considered one sentence, with each bullet being a part of it. But the citations after each bullet suggest that each is a separate sentence. For example, the first bullet is [S12], the second [S13], third [S14]. So the answer would be three sentences, each citing [S12], [S13], [S14] respectively. \n\nBut the user is asking for the three constellations. So the answer would be:\n\n1. Product and service development (CMMI for Development) [S12]\n2. Service establishment, management, and delivery (CMMI for Services) [S13]\n3. Product and service acquisition (CMMI for Acquisition) [S14]\n\nTherefore, each of these three points is a separate sentence with their respective citations. So the final answer should list each constellation with their citations."
