But wait, the question is about the wool business.

The year here is 1994. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of the wool business. The next sentence talks about starting the PET business in 1995, but that's not relevant here.

The citation for that sentence is [S9]. I should check if there's any other mention of his businesses. The other sentences talk about Indorama Chemicals, which was later known as Aurus Specialty Company Limited, but that's related to corncobs and furfural alcohol, not wool. The PET business is Indorama Polymers, but that's after the wool business. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be Indorama Holdings, cited from [S9]. There's no other citation needed here.
