  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Czechoslovak koruna in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document explains that the Czechoslovak koruna was the currency of Czechoslovakia from 1919 to 1939 and then again from 1945 to 1993. It was replaced by the Czech and Slovak korunas in 1993. The koruna had different phases, including a first, second, and third version. There were significant events like the 1953 currency reform which caused panic and economic issues. The document also mentions the consumer price index increases, showing inflation trends, especially a sharp rise in 1991. The koruna was replaced by the euro in Slovakia in 2009, but the Czech Republic still uses its own koruna.\n\nI need to make sure the summary includes the main periods, key events (like the 1953 reform and the 1993 split), and the eventual replacement by the euro. Also, mention the structure of the currency (hal\u00e9\u0159\u016f and halierov) and the ISO code. Keep it concise, avoiding too many details but hitting the main points. Check for any other important aspects, like the different koruna phases and the impact of inflation. Make sure the sentences flow logically and cover all essential information without being too wordy.\n</think>\n\nThe **Czechoslovak koruna** served as the official currency of Czechoslovakia from 1919 to 1939 and again from 1945 to 1993, undergoing multiple reforms and facing significant economic challenges, including hyperinflation and a controversial 1953 currency overhaul that caused public unrest. It was divided into two separate currencies, the Czech and Slovak korunas, in 1993 following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, with Slovakia adopting the euro in 2009 while the Czech Republic retained its own currency. The koruna was subdivided into 100 hal\u00e9\u0159\u016f (Czech) or halierov (Slovak), and its history reflects the political and economic shifts of the 20th century, including wartime disruptions and post-communist transitions. The document also highlights inflation trends, with a sharp 57.9% increase in 1991, underscoring the currency's instability in its final years.",

[S2] For a brief time in 1939 and again in 1993, it was also the currency of both the separate Czech Republic and Slovakia. [S3] On 8 February 1993, it was replaced by the Czech koruna and the Slovak koruna, both at par. [S4] The (last) ISO 4217 code and the local abbreviations for the koruna were *CSK* and *K\u010ds*.

I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for the date 8 February 1993. Looking at the sentences, I see sentence [S3] mentions that on 8 February 1993, the Czechoslovak koruna was replaced by the Czech koruna and the Slovak koruna, both at par. That seems to directly answer the question. \n\nI should check if there are other sentences that might also be relevant. The rest of the context talks about the history of the koruna, other reforms, and details about coins and banknotes, but nothing else about the replacement in 1993. So [S3] is the key sentence here. \n\nThe answer should state that the Czechoslovak koruna was replaced by the Czech koruna and the Slovak koruna. The citation would be [S3]. I need to make sure there are no other citations needed. The question is straightforward, so probably just that one citation."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking what separate currencies were introduced in 1939. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of 1939. The user provided a chunk of text with several sentences. Let me go through each sentence.\n\nLooking at [S13], it says: \"This first koruna circulated until 1939, when separate currencies for Bohemia and Moravia and Slovakia were introduced, at par with the Czechoslovak koruna.\" So that's a key sentence. Then [S14] mentions \"These were the Bohemian and Moravian koruna and the Slovak koruna.\" So those are the three currencies: Bohemian and Moravian koruna, and the Slovak koruna. Wait, but the question is about separate currencies introduced in 1939. The passage says that in 1939, separate currencies for Bohemia and Moravia and Slovakia were introduced. So the answer should be the Bohemian and Moravian koruna and the Slovak koruna. \n\nI need to check if there are other mentions. Let me check other sentences. [S2] talks about 1939 but mentions the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but that's about the koruna being the currency again. [S13] and [S14] are the relevant ones. So the answer is the Bohemian and Moravian koruna and the Slovak koruna. The citations would be [S13] and [S14]. \n\nWait, the question is about \"separate currencies\" introduced in 1939. The passage says that in 1939, separate currencies for Bohemia and Moravia and Slovakia were introduced. So the three currencies are Bohemian koruna, Moravian koruna, and Slovak koruna. But [S14] says \"Bohemian and Moravian koruna and the Slovak koruna.\" So that's three currencies. But the way it's written, maybe Bohemian and Moravian are combined? Or are they separate? The original text says \"Bohemian and Moravian koruna\" as a single entity, but perhaps they were separate. The passage might be referring to two separate currencies: one for Bohemia and Moravia, and another for Slovakia. Or maybe Bohemian and Moravian were combined into one, and Slovakia another. The exact answer depends on the text. The text says \"separate currencies for Bohemia and Moravia and Slovakia\", which might mean three separate ones, but the way [S14] is written, it lists \"Bohemian and Moravian koruna and the Slovak koruna.\" So maybe two separate currencies: one for Bohemia and Moravia (combined) and another for Slovakia. But the original question is asking for the separate currencies introduced. The answer should be as per the text. So according to [S13] and [S14], the separate currencies introduced were the Bohemian and Moravian koruna and the Slovak koruna. So the answer would list those two. But maybe the user expects three? Wait, the text says \"Bohemian and Moravian and Slovakia\" but in [S14], it's written as \"Bohemian and Moravian koruna and the Slovak koruna.\" So perhaps two separate currencies: one for Bohemia and Moravia (combined) and another for Slovakia. So the answer would be the Bohemian and Moravian koruna and the Slovak koruna. Therefore, the citations are [S13] and [S14]."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the outcome of the 1953 currency reform for many people. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of the 1953 reform. There's a section that says, \"A particularly drastic one was undertaken in 1953.\" Then it mentions the Communist Party dealing with a double market. The reform was effective from 1 June 1953, and they distributed new banknotes from the Soviet Union. \n\nThe next sentences talk about the reform being prepared quickly and some information leaking, causing panic. The president lied about the reform, and the next day, people could exchange money at specific rates. However, the key part here is the outcome. The passage states, \"The economic situation of many people got worse, and many petitions and demonstrations broke out...\" Also, the largest demonstration was in Plze\u0148 with 472 arrests.\n\nSo the main points are that the economic situation worsened, leading to protests and arrests. The citations here would be [S22] for the 1953 reform, [S23] about the double market, [S24] the reform details, [S25] the panic, [S27] the exchange rates, [S28] the nullification of financial instruments, and [S29] the economic decline and protests. Wait, the original context doesn't have a [S29], let me check again. The user's context ends at [S28]. The sentence about the economic situation getting worse is in [S28], and the protests are mentioned after that. But in the provided text, the exact sentence is: \"The economic situation of many people got worse, and many petitions and demonstrations broke out, the largest of which took place in Plze\u0148, where 472 people were arrested.\" That's part of the chunk, but looking at the citations, the sentence before that is [S28], and the next sentence is [S29]? Wait, no. Let me check the original supporting context again.\n\nLooking at the supporting context, the paragraph after [S28] is: \"The economic situation of many people got worse, and many petitions and demonstrations broke out, the largest of which took place in Plze\u0148, where 472 people were arrested.\" But in the given text, the citations are up to [S28]. The sentence about the economic situation is part of the same chunk. Wait, the user's supporting context has the following structure:\n\nAfter [S28], the next sentence is: \"The economic situation of many people got worse, and many petitions and demonstrations broke out, the largest of which took place in Plze\u0148, where 472 people were arrested.\" But in the original text, is there a citation for that sentence? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the user's provided supporting context, the paragraph after [S28] is:\n\n\"The economic situation of many people got worse, and many petitions and demonstrations broke out, the largest of which took place in Plze\u0148, where 472 people were arrested.\"\n\nBut in the original text, the citations are up to [S28], and this sentence doesn't have a citation. However, in the user's provided context, the sentences are numbered as [S1] to [S28], and the sentence about the economic situation is part of the same chunk but not assigned a citation. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's supporting context is structured with each sentence having a citation. For example, the sentence about the 1953 reform is [S22], then [S23] is about the double market, [S24] the reform details, [S25] the panic, [S26] the president's speech, [S27] the exchange rates, [S28] the nullification. Then the next sentence is the economic situation getting worse, but there's no [S29] in the user's context. So maybe that sentence is part of the same citation? Or perhaps it's a separate sentence without a citation. Wait, the user's context is given as:\n\nAfter [S28], the next sentence is:\n\n\"The economic situation of many people got worse, and many petitions and demonstrations broke out, the largest of which took place in Plze\u0148, where 472 people were arrested.\"\n\nBut in the original text provided by the user, this sentence isn't labeled with a citation. However, in the user's input, the citations are up to [S28], and this sentence is part of the same paragraph. So perhaps this sentence is not cited, but the user's context might have it as [S29]. Wait, looking back, the user's supporting context is:\n\nThe last part is:\n\n[S28] All insurance stock, state obligations and other commercial papers were nullified. [S29] The economic situation of many people got worse, and many petitions and demonstrations broke out, the largest of which took place in Plze\u0148, where 472 people were arrested.\n\nWait, no. The user's original input has:\n\nAfter [S28], the next sentence is:\n\n\"The economic situation of many people got worse, and many petitions and demonstrations broke out, the largest of which took place in Plze\u0148, where 472 people were arrested.\"\n\nBut in the user's provided text, the citations are up to [S28], and this sentence is not cited.

However, in the actual text provided by the user, perhaps there's a [S29] here. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the user's input:\n\nThe supporting context is:\n\nChunk:\n\n[S1] Czechoslovak koruna\n\n\n# Czechoslovak koruna\n\n\n\nThe **Czechoslovak koruna** (in Czech and Slovak: *koruna \u010deskoslovensk\u00e1*, at times *koruna \u010desko-slovensk\u00e1*; *koruna* means *crown*) was the currency of Czechoslovakia from 10 April 1919 to 14 March 1939, and from 1 November 1945 to 7 February 1993. [S2] For a brief time in 1939 and again in 1993, it was also the currency of both the separate Czech Republic and Slovakia. [S3] On 8 February 1993, it was replaced by the Czech koruna and the Slovak koruna, both at par. [S4] The (last) ISO 4217 code and the local abbreviations for the koruna were *CSK* and *K\u010ds*. [S5] One koruna equalled 100 *hal\u00e9\u0159\u016f* (Czech, singular: *hal\u00e9\u0159*) or *halierov* (Slovak, singular: *halier*). [S6] In both languages, the abbreviation *h* was used. [S7] The abbreviation was placed behind the numeric value. [S8] ## First koruna\n\nA currency called the *krone* in German and *koruna* in Czech was introduced in Austria-Hungary on 11 September 1892, as the first modern gold-based currency in the area. [S9] After the creation of an independent Czechoslovakia in 1918, an urgent need emerged for the establishment of a new currency system that would distinguish itself from the currencies of the other newly born countries suffering from inflation. [S10] The next year, on 10 April 1919, a currency reform took place, defining the new *koruna* as equal in value to the Austro-Hungarian krone. [S11] The first banknotes came into circulation the same year, the coins three years later, in 1922. [S12] This first koruna circulated until 1939, when separate currencies for Bohemia and Moravia and Slovakia were introduced, at par with the Czechoslovak koruna. [S13] These were the Bohemian and Moravian koruna and the Slovak koruna. [S14] ### Coins\n\n\n### Banknotes\n\n\n## Second koruna\n\nThe Czechoslovak koruna was re-established in 1945, replacing the two previous currencies at par. [S15] As a consequence of the war, the currency had lost much of its value. [S16] ### Coins\n\n\n### Banknotes\n\n\n## Third koruna\n\n| 2 Czechoslovak koruna (1986). [S17] | |\n| --- | --- |\n|\n| **Obverse**: Coat of arms of Czechoslovakia and linden twig surrounded by year and lettering \"\u010cESKOSLOVENSK\u00c1 SOCIALISTICK\u00c1 REPUBLIKA\" (Czechoslovak Socialist Republic). [S18] | **Reverse**: Hammer and sickle with five-pointed star within abstract linden leaf at left, face-value at right. [S19] |\n| 205,779,354 coins minted from 1972 to 1990. [S20] | |\n\nThe koruna went through a number of further reforms. [S21] A particularly drastic one was undertaken in 1953. [S22] At that time, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia had to deal with the existence of a double market in the country: a fixed market ensuring basic food availability (a remnant of the postwar quota system); and a free market, in which goods were as much as eight times more expensive but better quality. [S23] They decided to declare a currency reform effective from 1 June 1953 and to distribute new banknotes printed in the Soviet Union. [S24] The reform had been prepared very quickly and was confidential up to the last minute, but some information leaked anyway, causing a lot of panic. [S25] The night before the deadline, the president of Czechoslovakia, Anton\u00edn Z\u00e1potock\u00fd, made a radio speech, in which he lied to the nation that there was no possibility of a reform and quietened down the inhabitants. [S26] The next day, people (those lucky enough not to fit into the category of \"capitalistic elements\", a pejorative category which the intelligence agency used to blacklist certain individuals) were allowed to change up to 1,500 old korunas for new korunas at the rate of 5 old to 1 new koruna and the rest at the rate of 50 to 1. [S27] All insurance stock, state obligations and other commercial papers were nullified. [S28] The economic situation of many people got worse, and many petitions and demonstrations broke out, the largest of which took place in Plze\u0148, where 472 people were arrested.\n\nSo in this case, the sentence about the economic situation is not labeled with a citation. However, in the user's input, the last sentence is part of the same paragraph but doesn't have a citation. But according to the user's instructions, each sentence in the supporting context is numbered with [S1] to [S28], and the last sentence is not cited. However, in the actual text, the sentence about the economic situation is part of the same chunk but not cited. Therefore, when answering, I need to check if that sentence is cited or not.\n\nWait, looking at the user's input, the last sentence is:\n\n\"The economic situation of many people got worse, and many petitions and demonstrations broke out, the largest of which took place in Plze\u0148, where 472 people were arrested.\"\n\nBut in the user's provided text, this sentence is not followed by a citation. The previous citation is [S28], and then this sentence comes without a citation. Therefore, in the answer, this sentence would not have a citation. However, the user's instructions say that each sentence in the supporting context is inside <statement> tags with citations. So if the sentence is part of the supporting context, even without a citation, it should be included without a citation.\n\nBut the user's question is about the outcome of the 1953 reform. The key points are that the economic situation worsened, leading to protests and arrests. The sentence about the economic situation is not cited, but the previous sentences [S22] to [S28] are cited. However, the exact outcome is in the sentence without a citation. But maybe the user's context has that sentence as [S29], but in the provided text, it's not. Therefore, the answer would have to include that sentence without a citation, but according to the user's input, it's not cited. However, the user's instructions say that each sentence in the supporting context is numbered. So if the sentence is part of the supporting context, even without a citation, it's included. But in the user's input, the last sentence is not cited. Therefore, the answer would have to include that sentence without a citation.\n\nBut the user's example shows that each sentence in the supporting context is cited. However, in the provided text, the last sentence is not cited. Therefore, the answer would have to include that sentence without a citation. However, the user's example might have different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the input, and the sentence is actually cited as [S29]. But based on the given text, it's not. Therefore, the answer would have to state that the economic situation worsened, with no citation, but the other parts of the answer would have citations.\n\nBut the user's question is asking for the outcome, which is the economic situation getting worse and the protests. So the answer would be:\n\nThe outcome of the 1953 currency reform was that the economic situation of many people got worse, leading to petitions and demonstrations, including a large one in Plze\u0148 where 472 people were arrested. However, the sentence about the economic situation is not cited, but the preceding sentences are cited.\n\nBut according to the user's instructions, each sentence in the supporting context must be cited. Therefore, if the sentence is part of the supporting context, even without a citation, it's included. However, in the user's input, the last sentence is not cited. Therefore, the answer would have to include that sentence without a citation. But the user's example shows that even if a sentence doesn't have a citation, the <cite> tag is left empty.\n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\n<statement>The economic situation of many people got worse, and many petitions and demonstrations broke out, the largest of which took place in Plze\u0148, where 472 people were arrested.<cite></cite></statement>\n\nBut the user's question is about the outcome, so the answer should include this sentence. However, the user's supporting context may have this sentence as [S29], but in the provided text, it's not. Therefore, the answer would have to include it without a citation."

That seems relevant. The question is about the day after the policy change, and [S1] says \"the next day,\" which probably refers to the day after the policy change. \n\nThe exchange rates mentioned here are two different rates: 5:1 and 50:1. But the question is asking for the exchange rate. However, the answer might need to specify both rates as they were applied in different parts.

The exchange rates were 5 old to 1 new for up to 1,500 korunas and 50 to 1 for the rest. The question is about the day after the policy change, which matches the \"next day\" in [S1].

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking in which year the Czechoslovak koruna split into two independent currencies. I need to find the answer in the provided supporting context.\n\nLooking through the sentences, sentence S4 says: \"In 1993, on the breakup of Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak koruna split into two independent currencies: the Slovak koruna and the Czech koruna.\" That seems to directly answer the question. The year mentioned here is 1993. \n\nOther sentences don't mention the split. For example, S5 talks about the EU accession in 2004, and S6 mentions the Slovak koruna being replaced by the euro in 2009. But the actual split into two currencies is covered in S4. So the correct citation should be [S4]."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking about the requirement for the Czech and Slovak korunas to be replaced by the euro. I need to look at the supporting context provided and find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each sentence in the chunk. \n\nSentence S1 talks about exchanging old korunas for new ones, but that's about a currency reform, not the euro. S2 mentions nullifying financial instruments, which doesn't seem related. S3 is about economic situations and protests, not the euro. S4 explains the split of the Czechoslovak koruna into two after 1993. S5 says that joining the EU in 2004 meant they would replace their currencies with the euro once they met economic convergence criteria and had political will. S6 states that Slovakia adopted the euro in 2009, but the Czech koruna doesn't have a date yet. \n\nSo, the key part here is S5. It mentions that accession to the EU in 2004 required the currencies to be replaced by the euro once the countries met the criteria for economic convergence and had political will. The question is about the requirements, which would be those two factors: economic convergence criteria and political will. \n\nI need to check if there are other sentences that mention this. The other sentences either talk about specific events like the 1993 split or the replacement date for Slovakia. The answer is in S5. So the citation would be [S5]. \n\nWait, the question is about the requirement, so the answer is that they had to meet the criteria for economic convergence and have political will. The sentence S5 says \"once their respective countries met the criteria for economic convergence and there was the political will to do so.\" So that's the requirement. \n\nI should make sure there's no other information. The consumer price index data in S7 might not be relevant here. So the correct citation is S5."
