  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Las Colinas in Irving, Texas. Let me start by reading through the content carefully. The main topic seems to be an overview of Las Colinas as a planned community. The user wants a 3-5 sentence summary focusing on the main topic and key concepts.\n\nFirst, the document mentions that Las Colinas is a mixed-use planned community developed by Ben H. Carpenter in 1972. It's part of the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex and governed by The Las Colinas Association. The location's proximity to airports and its central position made it attractive for businesses. \n\nThen there's the history: it was one of the first planned communities, originally called El Ranchito de Las Colinas. It had a large land area and was a pioneer in urban planning. The 1980s saw a building boom with many Fortune 500 companies setting up there. There was a financial issue in the 80s but recovery in the late 90s.\n\nRecent info includes the number of companies, office spaces, and notable headquarters. Also, there are amenities like country clubs, golf courses, and attractions. The document also mentions the 2022 ExxonMobil move, which is a key recent event. \n\nGeography and climate: humid subtropical, neighborhoods, other developments like the entertainment district. Arts and culture sections mention the Toyota Music Factory and Irving Convention Center. Parks like the Flower Clock and Lake Carolyn. Government structure with the non-profit association. Education details with schools and the North Hills Preparatory. Infrastructure includes DART transit and major highways.\n\nKey concepts to highlight: planned community, business hub, history, major companies, amenities, recent developments (like ExxonMobil's move), and infrastructure. Need to condense all that into 3-5 sentences without getting too detailed. Make sure to mention the main aspects: development, business presence, amenities, and recent changes.\n</think>\n\nLas Colinas is a large, mixed-use planned community in Irving, Texas, developed in 1972 by Ben H. Carpenter as one of the first of its kind in the U.S., strategically located near major airports and the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, making it a hub for corporate relocations. It features over 25 million square feet of office space, home to Fortune 500 companies like ExxonMobil and Caterpillar, along with amenities such as golf courses, country clubs, and cultural venues like the Toyota Music Factory. Recent developments include ExxonMobil's 2022 headquarters move to Houston, while the area remains a key business and residential center with extensive infrastructure, educational institutions, and a blend of commercial and leisure facilities.",

I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of the developer. In the section labeled \"History,\" there's a sentence that says: \"Originally called *El Ranchito de Las Colinas* ('the Little Ranch of the Hills'), Las Colinas was developed in 1972 by cattle ranching millionaire Ben H. [S4] Carpenter.\" So that seems to answer both parts. The original name is El Ranchito de Las Colinas, and the developer is Ben H. Carpenter. \n\nI should check if there are other mentions. The rest of the context talks about the development's growth, companies located there, and recent changes, but nothing else about the original developer or name. The citations here are [S3] and [S4], but the sentence about the original name and developer is in [S3] and [S4]?

[S4] Carpenter. [S5]\n\nSo the sentence about the original name is in [S3], and the developer is mentioned in [S4]. But the sentence that combines both is split between [S3] and [S4]. However, in the context provided, the actual sentence that mentions both the original name and the developer is in [S3] and [S4]. Wait, no. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe exact text is:\n\n\"Originally called *El Ranchito de Las Colinas* (\"the Little Ranch of the Hills\"), Las Colinas was developed in 1972 by cattle ranching millionaire Ben H. [S4] Carpenter. [S5]\"\n\nSo the original name is in [S3], and the developer is in [S4]. But the sentence that includes both is split. However, in the context, the sentence that mentions the original name is [S3], and the developer is in [S4]. But the way the citations are placed, the sentence starting with \"Originally called...\" is [S3], and then the next part \"was developed in 1972 by...\" is [S4]. So the answer would need to cite both [S3] and [S4]. \n\nTherefore, the answer should state that the original name was El Ranchito de Las Colinas and the developer was Ben H.

Then, in the history section, it mentions that it was \"one of the first planned communities in the United States\" (S3). Also, it was \"the largest mixed-use development in the South\" (S5). These points highlight its significance as an early and large planned community.\n\nAdditionally, the passage talks about the urban planning aspect, noting that urban planners were consulted to lay out the entire town, which was ahead of other projects in Dallas suburbs (S6). This shows that its planning was innovative for its time.\n\nI should make sure to include these points in the answer, citing the relevant sentences.

However, the specific names here are ExxonMobil, GTE (Verizon), Kimberly-Clark, and Associates Corp. But I need to check if all of these are indeed Fortune 500 companies. Wait, the sentence says \"global headquarters of four Fortune 500 companies\" and then lists some examples.

The answer should list all the companies mentioned in [S10] as the global headquarters in Las Colinas. The other companies listed in [S16] are not specifically mentioned as Fortune 500 global headquarters, just that they have headquarters or offices there.

[S2] Due to its central location between Dallas and Fort Worth and its proximity to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Dallas Love Field airport, Las Colinas has been a focus of corporate and business relocation. [S3] ## History\n\nOriginally called *El Ranchito de Las Colinas* (\"the Little Ranch of the Hills\"), Las Colinas was developed in 1972 by cattle ranching millionaire Ben H. [S4] Carpenter.

[S7] In 1985, the first sign of financial trouble appeared at Las Colinas after a real estate market crash. [S8] However, another 6,500,000 square feet (604,000\u00a0m\u00b2) of office space was built in the late 1990s boom.

[S10] Other companies with headquarters in Las Colinas include Mission Foods, Trend Micro and La Quinta Inns and Suites. [S11] In 1999. [S12] La Quinta announced it would move its headquarters from San Antonio, stating it wanted to be near Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. [S13] It is also the home to The Kidd Kraddick Morning Show and ESPN Dallas. [S14] FOX News also tapes from the FOX News Texas Studios in Las Colinas.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking why La Quinta moved its headquarters to Las Colinas in 1999. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of La Quinta. There's a section under \"Recent\" where it says: \"Other companies with headquarters in Las Colinas include Mission Foods, Trend Micro and La Quinta Inns and Suites. [S11] In 1999. [S12] La Quinta announced it would move its headquarters from San Antonio, stating it wanted to be near Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. [S13]\" \n\nSo, the key sentence here is [S13], which states that La Quinta moved its headquarters to be near DFW International Airport. The citation for that is [S13]. \n\nI should check if there's any other information supporting this. The surrounding sentences mention that Las Colinas is near the airport, which is mentioned in [S2] and [S7], but the direct reason for La Quinta's move is specifically in [S13]. \n\nTherefore, the answer should cite [S13] because that's the exact reason given in the text."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the features of the TPC Four Seasons Las Colinas Resort. I need to look through the provided supporting context and pick out the relevant sentences.\n\nFirst, I'll scan each sentence. Sentence S1 mentions the resort hosting a championship since 1986, but that's more about events than features. S2 talks about tree-lined fairways, large greens, creeks, and ponds. That sounds like features of the golf course. S3 mentions the resort closing and management changes, which is about operations, not features. S4 lists high-rise office towers, retail centers, upscale residences, etc. Wait, but is that part of the resort or the broader Las Colinas area? The wording says \"It also contains,\" which might refer to the resort. But I need to check if the context clarifies that. The passage might be describing Las Colinas in general, not just the resort. Hmm, the question is specifically about the TPC Four Seasons Resort. So maybe S4 is about the larger Las Colinas development, not the resort itself. \n\nS5 mentions notable attractions like the Mustangs sculpture and Flower Clock. Are those part of the resort? The context says \"Notable attractions include,\" but it's not clear if they're within the resort. S6 refers to the Mustangs in the courtyard of Towers at Williams Square, which is part of the resort? Maybe. S7 mentions a River Walk-styled canal and the APT System. Again, not sure if these are part of the resort. S8 gives stats on office space, retail, homes\u2014probably part of the broader area. S9 mentions the Irving Convention Center, which is in Las Colinas. S10 and onwards talk about schools, other companies, etc. \n\nSo, focusing back on the resort. The question is about the features of the TPC Four Seasons Las Colinas Resort. The key sentences would be S2 (tree-lined fairways, greens, creeks, ponds), S4 (if it's part of the resort), S5 (attractions), S6 (Mustangs in the courtyard), S7 (canal and APT System). But need to verify if these are part of the resort. \n\nLooking at S4: \"It also contains high-rise office towers, retail centers...\" The \"It\" here might refer to Las Colinas, not the resort. Similarly, S5's \"Notable attractions\" could be in the area. However, the TPC Four Seasons is a resort, so maybe it includes some of these features. But the context might not explicitly link them. \n\nThe user might be looking for the golf course features (S2), and maybe the surrounding amenities. But the answer should strictly use the context. So, S2 is definitely a feature. S4 might not be relevant if it's about the broader area. S5 and S6 could be part of the resort's amenities. S7's canal might be part of the resort's design. \n\nSo, the answer should include S2, S5, S6, S7. But need to check the exact wording. For example, S5 says \"Notable attractions include the Mustangs... and Las Colinas Flower Clock.\" If the resort is part of Las Colinas, these might be attractions within the resort. Similarly, S6 mentions the Mustangs in the courtyard of the Towers at Williams Square, which is part of the resort. S7's canal and APT System could be part of the resort's features. \n\nTherefore, the features would be tree-lined fairways, large greens, creeks, ponds (S2), Mustangs sculpture and fountain (S5), Flower Clock (S5), the courtyard with Mustangs (S6), River Walk-styled canal (S7), and the APT System (S7). Also, S4's high-rise office towers etc., but if that's part of the resort, but the context might not specify. \n\nWait, the original question is about the TPC Four Seasons Resort. The TPC is a golf course, and the Four Seasons is a hotel. So maybe the features include the golf course features (S2), and the resort's amenities. The context might not explicitly list the hotel's features, but mentions the surrounding area. However, the user might expect the answer to include the golf course features and any mentioned resort amenities. \n\nSo, the answer would cite S2, S5, S6, S7. Also, S4 might be about the broader Las Colinas, but if the resort is part of that, maybe it's included. But the question is specifically about the resort, so better to stick to sentences that explicitly mention the resort. \n\nLooking again: S2 refers to \"It\" which is the TPC Four Seasons Resort. So S2 is definitely relevant. S5's \"Notable attractions\" might be in the area, but if the resort is part of Las Colinas, maybe they are part of the resort's features. However, the context doesn't explicitly state that. So maybe only S2 is directly about the resort's features. \n\nBut the user might expect more. Alternatively, maybe the answer should include all features mentioned in the context related to the resort. Since the question is about the resort, and the context mentions the TPC Four Seasons Las Colinas Resort, the features would be the golf course elements (S2), and any other features mentioned in the context that are part of the resort. \n\nLooking at S4: \"It also contains high-rise office towers...\" If \"It\" refers to the resort, then that's a feature. But the context might be describing Las Colinas as a whole. The original passage starts with the TPC Four Seasons Resort hosting the championship, then S2 describes the course features. S3 talks about the resort's management change. S4 might be part of the larger Las Colinas development. \n\nTherefore, to be safe, only include S2, S5, S6, S7 if they are part of the resort. But without explicit links, it's risky. Maybe the answer should only include S2, as the only direct feature of the resort. However, the user might expect more. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could include S2, S5, S6, S7, and S4, but need to check. Since the user wants accurate citations, only include sentences that are directly about the resort. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer should list the features from S2, and possibly S5, S6, S7 if they are part of the resort. But given the context, it's safer to include S2 and any other sentences that explicitly mention the resort's features. Since S5 and S6 mention attractions and courtyards in the context of Las Colinas, which might be part of the resort's amenities, but not certain. \n\nFinal answer: The TPC Four Seasons Las Colinas Resort includes tree-lined fairways, large greens, creeks, and ponds (S2). It also has notable attractions like the Mustangs at Las Colinas sculpture and fountain and the Las Colinas Flower Clock (S5). The Mustangs of Las Colinas are in the courtyard of the Towers at Williams Square (S6), and the complex features a River Walk-styled canal (S7). Additionally, the resort may include high-rise office towers, retail centers, etc. (S4), but this might refer to the broader area. However, based on the context, the most accurate citations are S2, S5, S6, S7."

S19 talks about a new low-carbon sector. Then S20 says the company announced closing its Las Colinas headquarters and moving to a new campus in Houston's Spring. \n\nSo the reason given here is the consolidation and restructuring of their business. The closure is part of their strategy to consolidate and restructure, moving to a new campus. The answer should be that ExxonMobil closed the headquarters as part of their business restructuring and consolidation, moving to Houston. The citations would be S18 and S20. Let me check if there's more. S21 and S22 mention earnings and debt, but not the reason for closing. So the main reasons are in S18 and S20. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other info.

I should check if there are any other sentences that mention the incorporation date, but from a quick scan, the other sentences talk about the structure of the association, not the date. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 21 August 1973, cited from [S4]. The other sentences don't have relevant info here. Make sure to format the statement correctly with the citation."
