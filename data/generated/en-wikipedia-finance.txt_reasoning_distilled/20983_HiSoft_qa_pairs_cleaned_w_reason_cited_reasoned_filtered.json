Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main points seem to be about HiSoft's history, its merger with VanceInfo to form Pactera, its operations, and key events like the IPO and acquisitions. The company was founded in 1996, listed on NASDAQ in 2010, and merged in 2012. They provided IT services to Fortune 500 companies, had a significant workforce growth, and were recognized in outsourcing lists. Also, they expanded through acquisitions and had a presence in multiple regions.\n\nI should make sure to mention the key dates, the merger, the IPO, the services they offered, their client base, and their recognition. Need to keep it concise, avoiding too many details. Let me check if I missed anything important. The company's headquarters in Dalian, the subsidiaries in Japan, the venture capital investors, and the specific acquisitions like NouvEON and BearingPoint Australia. But maybe those can be condensed. Focus on the main topic: HiSoft's background, growth, operations, and merger. Avoid minor details. Okay, time to put it all together in a few sentences.\n</think>\n\nHiSoft Technology International Limited, founded in 1996 in Dalian, China, was a multinational IT and business process outsourcing company that went public on NASDAQ in 2010. It expanded through strategic acquisitions, including NouvEON and BearingPoint Australia, and merged with VanceInfo in 2012 to form Pactera.

[S8] here it says \"In July 2011, hiSoft acquired NouvEON Technology Partners...\" So that's the key sentence.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking what percentage of HiSoft's revenue came from Fortune 500 clients in 2009. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nLooking at the chunks, there's a section under \"Operations\" that mentions 2009. Specifically, sentence S11 says, \"For 2009, the company reported approximately 35% of HiSoft's clients were Fortune 500, representing over 55% of revenue.\" Wait, so the percentage of clients that are Fortune 500 is 35%, but the revenue from them is 55%. The question is about revenue, not the number of clients. So the answer should be 55%. \n\nI need to check if there's any other mention. Let me scan through the other sentences. S12 talks about the same thing, confirming that 35% of clients were Fortune 500, but the revenue was over 55%. So the answer is 55%. The citation here would be S11 and S12. Wait, but the user's example shows that each sentence has its own citations. So the sentence that states the 55% revenue would be S11, and maybe S12 also? Let me check the exact wording.\n\nLooking at S11: \"For 2009, the company reported approximately 35% of HiSoft's clients were Fortune 500, representing over 55% of revenue.\" So this sentence directly states that the revenue from Fortune 500 clients was 55%. Therefore, the citation is S11. But maybe S12 also has info? S12 says \"They also reported 60% of their clients from US and Europe, 30% from Japan, and 10% from China.\" That's about client locations, not Fortune 500. So only S11 is relevant here. \n\nSo the answer is 55%, cited from S11. The user's example shows that each statement is in <statement> tags with citations. So the correct format would be a statement saying \"The percentage of HiSoft's revenue from Fortune 500 clients in 2009 was 55%.\" with citation [S11]."

Then [S13] says \"60% of their clients from US and Europe, 30% from Japan, and 10% from China.\" So that's [S13]. \n\nSo the answer would be 60% from US and Europe. The question is specifically about 2009, and the context mentions \"For 2009\" in [S11], which is the sentence before [S13]. So [S13] is the one that gives the percentages. Therefore, the answer is 60%, cited from [S13]. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other sentence that mentions this. Let me check again. The other sentences talk about different years or different metrics. For example, [S11] mentions 2009 but only about Fortune 500 clients. So yes, [S13] is the correct citation. The answer is 60%."

Wait, but the user is asking for companies besides Envisage and Teksen, so Ensemble would be included here. But I need to check if Ensemble is mentioned as an acquisition. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the sentence: \"In addition to acquiring Envisage, Ensemble International and Teksen Systems, hiSoft established operations...\" So yes, Ensemble International is listed as an acquired company. So besides Envisage and Teksen, there's also Ensemble International. But the user is asking for companies besides those two, so Ensemble would be another one. However, the question is phrased as \"besides Envisage and Teksen\", so the answer should include any other acquisitions mentioned. \n\nAdditionally, there's NouvEON and BearingPoint Australia. So the answer should include NouvEON Technology Partners, BearingPoint Australia, and Ensemble International. Wait, but the user might be looking for all companies except Envisage and Teksen. Let me check the context again.\n\nThe supporting context mentions:\n\n- Envisage (in the sentence with Ensemble and Teksen)\n- Ensemble International (same sentence)\n- Teksen Systems (same sentence)\n- NouvEON Technology Partners (S8)\n- BearingPoint Australia (S9)\n\nSo the question is asking for companies acquired besides Envisage and Teksen.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how HiSoft expanded into new markets. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan each sentence. Sentence S3 mentions a merger with VanceInfo to form Pactera. Mergers can be a way to expand, but I'm not sure if that's directly about new markets. Then S5 talks about establishing a Japan-based subsidiary in 2002, which was later renamed. That's a direct expansion into Japan. \n\nLooking at S8, HiSoft acquired NouvEON Technology Partners in the US. Acquiring a company in another country would help enter that market. Then S9 mentions acquiring BearingPoint Australia in 2012, which is Australia. So those acquisitions are expansions. \n\nAlso, S10 says HiSoft delivered services in the Americas, Europe, and Asia, but that's more about their existing operations. However, the question is about how they expanded. The key points would be the acquisitions and the subsidiary establishment. \n\nThe merger in S3 might be more about combining with a peer rather than expanding into new markets. The acquisitions in the US (S8) and Australia (S9) are clear examples. The Japan subsidiary (S5) is another. Also, S10 mentions establishing operations in the US, Singapore, and Japan through various means. Wait, S10 says \"established operations in the US, Singapore and Japan through acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures.\" So that's another point. \n\nSo the answer should include the establishment of the Japan subsidiary, acquisitions in the US and Australia, and establishing operations through various methods in other regions. Each of these points needs to be cited with their respective sentence numbers. Let me check the sentences again to make sure I have the right citations. \n\nYes, S5 for Japan subsidiary, S8 for NouvEON in the US, S9 for BearingPoint Australia. Also, S10 mentions establishing operations in US, Singapore, Japan via acquisitions, etc. So that's another citation. \n\nSo the answer would list these methods with the corresponding citations."
