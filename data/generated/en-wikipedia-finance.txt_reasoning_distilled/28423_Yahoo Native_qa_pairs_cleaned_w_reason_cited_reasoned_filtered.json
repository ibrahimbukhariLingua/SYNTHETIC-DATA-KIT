Then Yahoo Gemini under Marissa Mayer, focusing on native ads. \n\nPatent issues with GoTo's patents and lawsuits against Google. Also, trademark issues with Lens.com and 1-800 Contacts. The adware partnership with Gator (Claria) caused problems, leading to Yahoo's Toolbar to combat it.\n\nKey points: Yahoo Native's evolution from GoTo to Overture to Yahoo, the acquisition, the platforms like Panama and Gemini, patent litigation, and the adware partnership.

Keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Avoid too many details but hit the main concepts.\n</think>\n\nYahoo Native, formerly known as Yahoo! Advertising and Yahoo! Gemini, is a pay-per-click advertising service that evolved from Yahoo's acquisition of Overture Services (originally GoTo) in 2003. It aimed to compete with Google in search advertising through platforms like Panama (2007) and later native ad solutions under Gemini, focusing on integrating ads seamlessly with content. The service faced legal challenges, including patent disputes with Google and trademark issues, while partnerships like Overture's adware collaboration with Gator sparked criticism. Over time, Yahoo rebranded and refined its advertising strategies to enhance ad relevance and revenue, reflecting its ongoing efforts to adapt in a competitive digital advertising landscape.",

      "chunk": "Chunk:\n\n[S1] Yahoo Native\n\n\n# Yahoo Native\n\n\n\n**Yahoo! [S2] Native** (formerly known as **Yahoo! [S3] Advertising**, **Yahoo! [S4] Search Marketing** and **Yahoo! [S5] Gemini**) is a native \"Pay per click\" Internet advertising service provided by Yahoo. [S6] Yahoo began offering this service after acquiring **Overture Services, Inc.** The current offering of Yahoo Native launched in 2014 as Yahoo! [S7] Gemini. [S8] It handles advertising for both Yahoo and AOL properties, as well as other media outlets. [S9] ## History\n\n\n### GoTo and Overture\n\nGoTo (not to be confused with Go.com or Go2Net) was an Idealab spin off and was the first company to successfully provide a pay-for-placement search service. [S10] It started off with the purchase of World Wide Web Worm (WWWW), one of the oldest search engines. [S11] GoTo is considered to have been an influential pioneer of paid search. [S12] In February 1998, GoTo offered advertisers the option of bidding on how much they would be willing to pay to appear at the top of results in response to specific searches. [S13] The bid amount was paid by the advertiser to GoTo every time a searcher clicked on a link to the advertiser's website. [S14] By July 1998, advertisers were paying anything up to a dollar per click. [S15] In June 1999, GoTo launched a tool set *direct traffic centre* (dtc) to enable advertisers access to keywords and real time bidding. [S16] GoTo's business model was based on the idea that its paid listings would make it more relevant than other services, especially for general searches, and web sites that pay more are probably better sites. [S17] A similar service had been offered by Open Text in 1996, but this precipitated outcries and bad publicity because searchers at the time did not want the search process more commercialized. [S18] In contrast, GoTo's pay-for-placement model was very successful. [S19] Commenters theorized that the Internet had matured in the intervening two years, and this type of economic models were more acceptable since the web was no longer just a place for academic research, but also a place for buying products. [S20] GoTo founder Bill Gross speculated at the launch that GoTo would succeed because, as a relatively new service, it had no reputation to taint with paid listings, unlike Open Text. [S21] On October 8, 2001, GoTo renamed itself Overture Services, Inc. [S22] GoTo's chief operating officer Jaynie Studenmund, mother of fallen U.S. [S23] soldier Scott Studenmund, said, \"We also felt it was a sophisticated enough name, in case our products expand.\"\n\nThrough partnerships, Overture enabled portals such as MSN and Yahoo to monetize the hundreds of millions of web searches made each day on their sites. [S24] Indeed, these partnerships proved highly lucrative, and in a period otherwise marked by dot-com failures, Overture became a substantial profit driver for portals like Yahoo\n\nThis success enabled Overture to acquire web sites such as AltaVista and AlltheWeb. [S25] ### Acquisition of Overture by Yahoo! [S26] On October 7, 2003, Overture was acquired by its biggest customer, Yahoo!, for $1.63 billion. [S27] The old brand name of Overture was phased out as Yahoo rebranded many of its products under the Yahoo name. [S28] The exception to this was in Japan and Korea where the local businesses continued to use the Overture brand. [S29] ### Panama",
      "question": "Which company did Yahoo acquire to begin offering its pay-per-click advertising service?",
      "answer": "<statement>Yahoo began offering its pay-per-click advertising service after acquiring **Overture Services, Inc.**<cite>[S6]</cite></statement> <statement>The acquisition of Overture Services, Inc. by Yahoo! for $1.63 billion on October 7, 2003, marked the beginning of Yahoo's pay-per-click advertising service.<cite>[S26]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking which company Yahoo acquired to begin offering its pay-per-click advertising service. I need to look through the supporting context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of Yahoo acquiring a company related to pay-per-click. The user mentioned that the answer should be cited with sentence numbers. \n\nLooking at the first chunk, there's a sentence [S2] that mentions Yahoo Native, formerly known as Yahoo! Advertising, Yahoo! Search Marketing, and Yahoo! Gemini. Then in [S6], it says Yahoo began offering the service after acquiring Overture Services, Inc. That seems directly relevant. \n\nFurther down, there's a section about the acquisition of Overture by Yahoo. Specifically, [S26] states that Overture was acquired by Yahoo on October 7, 2003, for $1.63 billion. Also, [S27] mentions that the old brand name Overture was phased out after the acquisition. \n\nSo the key points are that Yahoo acquired Overture Services, Inc. to start their pay-per-click service. The citations would be [S6] and [S26]. Let me check if there are other mentions. The sentence in [S26] is about the acquisition, and [S6] mentions the acquisition as the reason Yahoo started the service. \n\nI think that's it. The answer should be Overture Services, Inc. with citations [S6] and [S26]."

[S2] The exception to this was in Japan and Korea where the local businesses continued to use the Overture brand. [S3] ### Panama\n\n**Panama** was an online advertising platform created by Yahoo!, launched on 5 February 2007. [S4] Panama was Yahoo's effort to close the wide gap with Google in the race for search advertising dollars, a fast-growing business then dominated by Google, which is now also dominated by Google. [S5] Customers with accounts already on Yahoo! [S6] were transferred to the new system over the following few months. [S7] Yahoo! [S8] inherited the search advertising business when it purchased Overture (previously named Goto.com). [S9] Until Panama, Yahoo! [S10] search continued to operate the original simplistic algorithm which ranked text ads according to how much advertisers bid for the keyword searched by the user. [S11] Meanwhile, Google operates under a more sophisticated model, which ranks paid ads on the basis of bid price as well as prior click-through rates. [S12] This improvement generally produces higher click through rates (hence higher revenues) for the search engine.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 This also allowed Yahoo to control the pricing of ad auctions rather than having the auctions operate at market value. [S13] For example, an ambulance-chasing attorney bidding for the keywords \"back pain\" would likely get a lower clickthrough rate than the keyword \"physiotherapist\", regardless of what the two parties bid per click. [S14] An algorithm that eventually de-prioritizes the attorney's ad is better for the search engine (in terms of revenue produced) and the user (more relevant ads). [S15] Key players in the Panama project were Brian Acton, David Henke & Qi Lu. [S16] #### Features\n\nThe platform provided advertisers with a digital dashboard where they can manage their marketing campaigns, aim ads geographically, and test their effectiveness. [S17] It included interactive tools that suggest to advertisers what to bid based on their budget and the number of users they want to attract. [S18] ### Yahoo Gemini\n\nDuring the tenure of Marissa Mayer as Yahoo's CEO she started a new advertising platform project under the name Gemini. [S19] The goal was to build a native advertising solution, where the ads take on the format of the content they accompany. [S20] The so-called \"quality index\" gave advertisers a sense of how the system would rank an ad along with sophisticated analytical tools that gave advertisers insights on why certain campaigns had been effective.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\n\n## Patent litigation\n\nIn May 1999, GoTo filed a patent application titled \"System and method for influencing a position on a search result list generated by a computer network search engine\", which was granted as in July 2001. [S21] A related patent has also been granted in Australia and other patent applications remain pending. [S22] Prior to its acquisition by Yahoo, Overture initiated infringement proceedings under this patent against FindWhat.com in January 2002 and Google in April 2002. [S23] The lawsuit against Google related to its AdWords service. [S24] In February 2002, Google introduced a service called AdWords Select that allowed marketers to bid for higher placement in marked sections - a tactic that had some similarities to Overture's search-listing auctions. [S25] Following Yahoo's acquisition of Overture, the lawsuit was settled with Google agreeing to issue 2.7 million shares of common stock to Yahoo in exchange for a perpetual license.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what happened to the old brand name of Overture after Yahoo's rebranding. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of Overture and Yahoo's rebranding. Sentence [S1] says, \"The old brand name of Overture was phased out as Yahoo rebranded many of its products under the Yahoo name.\" That seems directly relevant. It states that Overture's old brand was phased out during Yahoo's rebranding. \n\nThen, there's [S2], which mentions that in Japan and Korea, the local businesses continued to use the Overture brand. So, the phasing out wasn't absolute; there were exceptions. But the main point is that globally, the old brand was phased out. \n\nLooking at other sentences, [S8] talks about Yahoo inheriting the search advertising business when it purchased Overture, but that's more about the acquisition rather than the rebranding. The question is specifically about the rebranding, so [S1] and [S2] are the key points here. \n\nI don't see any other sentences that directly address the fate of the Overture brand after rebranding. The rest of the context discusses Panama, Gemini, patent litigation, etc., which aren't directly related. \n\nSo the answer should state that the old brand name was phased out, except in Japan and Korea. The citations would be [S1] and [S2]. I need to make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with the correct citations. Also, check if any other sentences might have relevant info, but I think that's it."

There's a section about Panama, which is Yahoo's platform. Sentence S10 mentions that until Panama, Yahoo's search used an original simplistic algorithm that ranked ads based on the bid for the keyword. Then, sentence S11 says Google used a more sophisticated model that considered both bid price and prior click-through rates. \n\nSo the key difference here is that Yahoo was using a simpler model based solely on bid amounts, while Google had a more complex system that also took into account the click-through rates. That would mean Google's approach considered ad relevance and performance, not just the bid. The context also mentions that this improvement led to higher click-through rates and revenues for Google. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other sentences that add more details. Looking through the rest, S12 talks about Yahoo controlling pricing, but that's after Panama. The answer should focus on the pre-Panama era.

I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the sections mentioned. There's a section titled \"Patent litigation\" which starts with information about GoTo's patent application in 1999 and the lawsuits. Specifically, sentence [S23] mentions that Overture initiated infringement proceedings against Google in April 2002. Then, in [S26], it says that after Yahoo acquired Overture, the lawsuit was settled with Google issuing 2.7 million shares to Yahoo in exchange for a perpetual license.\n\nSo the key points here are the settlement details. The outcome was a settlement where Google gave shares to Yahoo. I need to make sure there are no other sentences that add more details. The other sentences in the patent litigation section talk about the patent being granted and the specific lawsuits, but [S26] directly states the outcome. \n\nI should structure the answer to mention the settlement, the number of shares, and the exchange for a perpetual license. The citations would be [S23] and [S26]. Wait, [S23] is about initiating the lawsuit, and [S26] is the settlement. So the outcome is in [S26]. But maybe [S23] is also relevant because it's part of the litigation process. However, the question is about the outcome, so [S26] is the main citation. Let me check the exact wording. The user wants the outcome, so the answer should be based on [S26]. \n\nSo the answer would be that the litigation was settled with Google issuing 2.7 million shares to Yahoo for a perpetual license. The citations would be [S26]. But maybe [S23] is also needed because it mentions the lawsuit against Google. However, the outcome is specifically in [S26]. The user might need both sentences to fully answer, but according to the instructions, each sentence should have its own citations. So the statement about the settlement would cite [S26], and the mention of the lawsuit would cite [S23]. But the question is about the outcome, so the main citation is [S26]. \n\nI think the correct approach is to have one statement citing [S26] and another statement citing [S23] if needed. But the answer should be concise. Let me check the exact sentences again. \n\nThe user's question is \"What was the outcome of the patent litigation between Overture and Google?\" The answer is in [S26], which states the settlement terms. So the statement should be: \"The outcome of the patent litigation between Overture and Google was a settlement where Google agreed to issue 2.7 million shares of common stock to Yahoo in exchange for a perpetual license.\" Cited as [S26]. \n\nI don't see any other sentences that discuss the outcome. The other sentences in the patent litigation section are about the patent being granted and the initiation of the lawsuit, but not the outcome. So the correct citation is [S26]."

      "chunk": "Chunk:\n\n[S1] The old brand name of Overture was phased out as Yahoo rebranded many of its products under the Yahoo name. [S2] The exception to this was in Japan and Korea where the local businesses continued to use the Overture brand. [S3] ### Panama\n\n**Panama** was an online advertising platform created by Yahoo!, launched on 5 February 2007. [S4] Panama was Yahoo's effort to close the wide gap with Google in the race for search advertising dollars, a fast-growing business then dominated by Google, which is now also dominated by Google. [S5] Customers with accounts already on Yahoo! [S6] were transferred to the new system over the following few months. [S7] Yahoo! [S8] inherited the search advertising business when it purchased Overture (previously named Goto.com). [S9] Until Panama, Yahoo! [S10] search continued to operate the original simplistic algorithm which ranked text ads according to how much advertisers bid for the keyword searched by the user. [S11] Meanwhile, Google operates under a more sophisticated model, which ranks paid ads on the basis of bid price as well as prior click-through rates. [S12] This improvement generally produces higher click through rates (hence higher revenues) for the search engine.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48 This also allowed Yahoo to control the pricing of ad auctions rather than having the auctions operate at market value. [S13] For example, an ambulance-chasing attorney bidding for the keywords \"back pain\" would likely get a lower clickthrough rate than the keyword \"physiotherapist\", regardless of what the two parties bid per click. [S14] An algorithm that eventually de-prioritizes the attorney's ad is better for the search engine (in terms of revenue produced) and the user (more relevant ads). [S15] Key players in the Panama project were Brian Acton, David Henke & Qi Lu. [S16] #### Features\n\nThe platform provided advertisers with a digital dashboard where they can manage their marketing campaigns, aim ads geographically, and test their effectiveness. [S17] It included interactive tools that suggest to advertisers what to bid based on their budget and the number of users they want to attract. [S18] ### Yahoo Gemini\n\nDuring the tenure of Marissa Mayer as Yahoo's CEO she started a new advertising platform project under the name Gemini. [S19] The goal was to build a native advertising solution, where the ads take on the format of the content they accompany. [S20] The so-called \"quality index\" gave advertisers a sense of how the system would rank an ad along with sophisticated analytical tools that gave advertisers insights on why certain campaigns had been effective.\u1d9c\u2071\u1d57\u1d43\u1d57\u2071\u1d52\u207f \u207f\u1d49\u1d49\u1d48\u1d49\u1d48\n\n\n## Patent litigation\n\nIn May 1999, GoTo filed a patent application titled \"System and method for influencing a position on a search result list generated by a computer network search engine\", which was granted as in July 2001. [S21] A related patent has also been granted in Australia and other patent applications remain pending. [S22] Prior to its acquisition by Yahoo, Overture initiated infringement proceedings under this patent against FindWhat.com in January 2002 and Google in April 2002. [S23] The lawsuit against Google related to its AdWords service. [S24] In February 2002, Google introduced a service called AdWords Select that allowed marketers to bid for higher placement in marked sections - a tactic that had some similarities to Overture's search-listing auctions. [S25] Following Yahoo's acquisition of Overture, the lawsuit was settled with Google agreeing to issue 2.7 million shares of common stock to Yahoo in exchange for a perpetual license.

I need to look through the provided supporting context and find the relevant sentences.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of Panama's features. The chunk starts with \"### Panama\" and there's a section titled \"Features\" later on. Let me check those parts.\n\nLooking at the sentences, [S16] mentions that the platform provided a digital dashboard for managing campaigns, targeting geographically, and testing effectiveness. Then [S17] talks about interactive tools that suggest bids based on budget and user numbers. Those seem like key features. \n\nI should make sure there's no other information. The rest of the text discusses other topics like Yahoo Gemini, patent litigation, and trademark issues, which aren't relevant here. So the answer should include the points from [S16] and [S17]. \n\nNow, I need to structure the answer with each statement and the corresponding citations.

[S13] Overture faced a great deal of criticism for entering into this partnership. [S14] When Yahoo acquired Overture, the Claria software impaired the operation of Yahoo's services. [S15] For example, when a user with a Claria application installed used Yahoo Search, they received a standard set of Yahoo results with sponsored listings at the top supplied by Overture. [S16] The user would then receive a full-screen pop-under window from Search Scout. [S17] Since Search Scout uses Overture's paid listings as well, Claria's window has exactly the same listings as the Yahoo search results.

      "question": "In what year did Google introduce AdWords Select, and what was its purpose?",
      "answer": "<statement>Google introduced AdWords Select in 2002. Its purpose was to allow marketers to bid for higher placement in marked sections, a tactic that had some similarities to Overture's search-listing auctions.<cite>[S1]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking in what year Google introduced AdWords Select and what its purpose was. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information. Let me scan each sentence.\n\nLooking at the first sentence in the chunk: [S1] says \"In February 2002, Google introduced a service called AdWords Select...\" So that's the year, 2002. The purpose is mentioned as \"allowed marketers to bid for higher placement in marked sections - a tactic that had some similarities to Overture's search-listing auctions.\" \n\nI need to check if there's any other information in other sentences that might add to this. The rest of the context talks about trademark issues, a partnership with Gator, and other legal stuff, but nothing about AdWords Select's purpose beyond what's in [S1]. \n\nSo the answer should be 2002 and the purpose is allowing bids for higher placement similar to Overture's auctions. The citation is [S1]. I need to make sure each part of the answer is correctly cited. Since the year and purpose are both in [S1], the citation is [S1]. \n\nI should structure the response with two statements: one for the year and one for the purpose, each with their citations. Wait, but the user might expect a single statement combining both parts. However, the instructions say each sentence is inside <statement> tags. So maybe split into two sentences if needed. But the example shows a single sentence with citations. Let me check the example again.\n\nThe example has two sentences, each in their own <statement> tags. So perhaps the answer should be two statements. But the question has two parts: year and purpose. So maybe two statements. However, the user might want a single statement. Let me see.\n\nThe question is \"In what year... and what was its purpose?\" So it's two parts. The answer should address both. But according to the response format, each sentence is a separate statement. So perhaps one statement for the year and another for the purpose. But the example shows a single sentence with two citations. Alternatively, maybe combine them into one sentence. Let me check the example again.\n\nThe example has: \"This is a sample sentence 2 which has 2 citations.\" So a single sentence with multiple citations. So maybe the answer can be one sentence combining both parts, citing [S1]. \n\nSo the answer would be: \"Google introduced AdWords Select in 2002. Its purpose was to allow marketers to bid for higher placement in marked sections, similar to Overture's search-listing auctions.\" Both parts in one sentence with [S1] citation. \n\nBut the user might want the year and purpose as separate points. However, the instructions don't specify, so following the example, it's better to have one sentence. Let me confirm the exact question. The question is two parts, but the answer can be in one sentence. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: <statement>Google introduced AdWords Select in 2002. Its purpose was to allow marketers to bid for higher placement in marked sections, a tactic similar to Overture's search-listing auctions.<cite>[S1]</cite></statement>"

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in the 2013 case involving Lens.com and 1-800 Contacts. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information. The passage mentions the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in sentence S3. Let me check that.\n\nLooking at S3: \"In 2013, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held in Lens.com, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc. that online contact lens seller Lens.com did not commit trademark infringement when it purchased Yahoo and Google AdWords search advertisements using competitor 1-800 Contacts' federally registered 1800 CONTACTS trademark as a keyword.\"\n\nSo the key points here are the court, the year, the case name, and the ruling. The court ruled that Lens.com didn't infringe on the trademark by using the competitor's trademark as a keyword in their AdWords ads. \n\nI should make sure there's no other information in the context that might add more details. The other sentences talk about other cases or events, like the FTC complaint in S7 and S8, but those are separate. The answer is specifically in S3. \n\nThe user wants the answer with citations. Since the information is in S3, the citation should be [S3]. The statement should be concise, stating the ruling. \n\nI need to structure the response as per the format: <statement> followed by the answer, then <cite>[S3]</cite>. No other citations are needed here because the other sentences don't directly answer the question. \n\nDouble-checking the case name and the details. The case is Lens.com, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc., and the ruling is about not committing trademark infringement. Yes, that's correct. \n\nI think that's all. The answer is straightforward from S3."

[S11] states that these keywords were submitted to Overture's search engine. [S12] explains that advertisers paid for listings in Overture, which were then advertised through Gator's Search Scout software, even if they didn't want to do with Gator. \n\nSo the purpose was likely to use Gator's adware to collect search keywords and feed them into Overture's system, allowing advertisers to reach users through Gator's software. However, this led to criticism and issues with Yahoo's services later. \n\nI need to make sure the citations are correct. The partnership announcement is in [S9], and the details about the partnership's operation are in [S10], [S11], [S12]. But the question asks for the purpose. The purpose is to have Gator's software monitor activity and submit keywords to Overture, which would then use those keywords for advertising.
