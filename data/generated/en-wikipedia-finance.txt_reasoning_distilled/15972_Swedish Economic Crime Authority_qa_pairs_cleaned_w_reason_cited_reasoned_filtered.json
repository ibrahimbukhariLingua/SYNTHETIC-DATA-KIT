  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Swedish Economic Crime Authority in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main points seem to be the purpose of SECA, its establishment, organizational structure, and key functions. The first paragraph introduces SECA as a government agency under the Ministry of Justice, responsible for investigating and prosecuting financial crimes like tax fraud, money laundering, etc. It also mentions monitoring trends, initiating joint actions, and proposing legislation. The second section is about its history, established in 1998 to keep experts focused on economic crime. The third part talks about the structure: national jurisdiction, headquarters in Stockholm, 700 employees, including prosecutors, police officers, specialists, and the leadership.\n\nI need to condense this. Start with the main topic: SECA's role. Mention the types of crimes they handle. Then the establishment in 1998, why it was created. Then the organizational structure: number of employees, departments, leadership. Also, their focus on serious crimes and financial markets. Avoid too many numbers but include key ones like 700 employees, 11 local offices, 5 police units. Make sure to highlight their mandate, history, and structure in concise sentences. Check for any other key concepts like monitoring trends and legislative proposals. Keep it to 3-5 sentences. Let me try to put that together.\n</think>\n\nThe **Swedish Economic Crime Authority** (SECA) is a government agency under the Ministry of Justice, tasked with investigating and prosecuting financial crimes such as tax fraud, money laundering, and market abuse, while also monitoring economic crime trends and proposing legislative reforms. Established in 1998, it was created to centralize expertise in economic crime by co-locating prosecutors and police officers, ensuring focused investigations. SECA operates nationally with a headquarters in Stockholm, employing around 700 staff\u2014including prosecutors, police officers, and specialists\u2014and is organized into 11 local prosecution offices and five specialized police units. Its mandate emphasizes tackling serious financial crimes, recovering illicit proceeds, and fostering inter-agency collaboration.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what types of financial crimes SECA investigates and prosecutes. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage. The first sentence mentions that SECA is a Swedish government agency under the Ministry of Justice, tasked with investigating and prosecuting financial crimes. Then, in [S2], it lists specific crimes: dishonesty to creditors, bookkeeping crime, financial market abuse, money laundering, tax fraud, and EU fraud. \n\nI should check if there are other mentions. [S3] talks about serious economic crime, especially financial market crimes and recovering proceeds, but those are more about focus areas rather than specific types. The rest of the sections discuss history, structure, etc., which don't add to the list of crimes. \n\nSo the main list is in [S2]. The answer should include those six types. I need to make sure each is cited correctly. The user wants each sentence in <statement> tags with citations. Since the answer is a list, each type might be a separate statement. But the original context lists them in one sentence. Wait, the user's example has each sentence as a separate statement. So I need to split the list into individual statements if necessary. However, the original context's [S2] sentence is a single sentence listing all the crimes. So maybe that's one statement with the citation [S2]. \n\nBut the question is asking for the types, so the answer would be the list from [S2]. So the correct citation is [S2]. I need to present each type as a separate statement? Or just the entire list in one statement. The example shows that a single sentence can have multiple citations. But in this case, the list is in one sentence. So the answer would be a single statement citing [S2]. \n\nWait, looking at the supporting context again: [S2] says \"investigate and prosecute financial crimes, like dishonesty to creditors, bookkeeping crime, financial market abuse, money laundering, tax fraud and EU fraud.\" So that's one sentence listing all the types. Therefore, the answer should be a statement that includes all those types, citing [S2]. \n\nSo the final answer would be a <statement> containing all those crimes, with <cite>[S2]</cite>. I need to make sure there are no other citations. The other sentences don't add more types. [S3] mentions financial market crime but it's part of the list in [S2]. So the correct citation is only [S2]."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking about the additional responsibilities of SECA besides investigating crimes. The supporting context is provided in the chunk with various sentences numbered from S1 to S9.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each sentence and identify what SECA's responsibilities are. The user wants to know what else they do beyond just investigating crimes. Let me scan through each sentence.\n\nLooking at S1: It mentions that SECA is a Swedish government agency under the Ministry of Justice, tasked with investigating and prosecuting financial crimes. But that's part of their main role, so maybe not the additional responsibilities.\n\nS2: Here it says SECA is also tasked to monitor and analyse economic crime trends, initiate joint action between authorities, and propose legislative changes to curb economic crime. That sounds like additional responsibilities beyond just investigating. So this sentence probably has citations. The question is about \"additional\" responsibilities, so this seems relevant.\n\nS3: Focuses on serious economic crime, especially financial markets and recovering proceeds. That's part of their main duties, so maybe not additional.\n\nS4: Talks about the history, setup in 1998. Not responsibilities.\n\nS5: Also about history, co-housing police and prosecutors. Not responsibilities.\n\nS6: Organizational structure, national jurisdiction, headquarters in Stockholm. Not responsibilities.\n\nS7: Employees count and structure. Not responsibilities.\n\nS8: Mentions SECA has prosecutors, police officers, specialists. Not responsibilities.\n\nS9: Leadership and operational units. Not responsibilities.\n\nSo the main additional responsibilities are in S2. The question is asking for \"additional\" so the answer should be the parts from S2. The answer would be that SECA monitors and analyses economic crime trends, initiates joint actions between authorities, and proposes legislative changes. The citation for that is [S2]. \n\nWait, but the user wants each sentence in the answer to have citations. So the answer should be a statement that includes those points, citing S2. Let me check if there are other sentences. Maybe S3? But S3 says they focus on serious economic crime and recovering proceeds. That might be part of their investigative role. The question is about \"additional\" responsibilities, so maybe monitoring trends, joint actions, and legislative proposals are the extra ones. So the answer is based on S2. Therefore, the statement should be citing S2."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the main operational units of SECA. First, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nLooking at the passage, there's a section titled \"Organizational structure\" which mentions that SECA has national jurisdiction and operates nationally with a headquarters in Stockholm. Then, under the same section, it says: \"SECA's operational units consist of 11 local public prosecution offices that investigate and prosecute financial crimes and five operational police units with specialist functions such as surveillance teams and criminal intelligence units.\" \n\nThat seems to directly answer the question. The key points here are the 11 local public prosecution offices and the five operational police units. The sentence number here is S9. I should check if there's any other mention of operational units elsewhere. \n\nLooking through the other sentences, S1 talks about the name and mandate, S2 and S3 mention their focus areas, S4-S6 are about history, S7 mentions the number of employees but not the units. S8 mentions the leadership but not the units. So the main info is in S9. \n\nSo the answer should state that the main operational units are 11 local public prosecution offices and five operational police units. The citation would be [S9]. I need to make sure there's no other sentences contributing to this. The user might be looking for those two main units, and the answer should be concise with the correct citation."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the main reason behind establishing SECA's specialized structure. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage. The first sentence mentions that SECA is a Swedish government agency under the Ministry of Justice, responsible for investigating financial crimes. But that's more about its role than the reason for its structure. \n\nLooking at sentence S4, which is about the history of SECA. It says that SECA was set up in 1998 to safeguard the expertise of experienced police officers and prosecutors who were often assigned to other investigations not related to economic crime. That seems relevant. The key point here is that they wanted to keep those experts focused on economic crime instead of being spread thin on other cases. \n\nThen, sentence S5 mentions that SECA was the first in Sweden to co-house police officers and prosecutors under the same roof. This suggests that the specialized structure was created to have these professionals work together more effectively. \n\nThe question is about the main reason for the specialized structure. The answer likely combines both safeguarding expertise and facilitating collaboration. However, the user is asking for the main reason. The first part of S4 mentions safeguarding expertise, while S5 talks about co-housing. But the question is about the structure, which includes both the organization and the purpose. \n\nWait, the user specifically asks for the \"specialized structure.\" The answer would be that the main reason was to ensure that experts in economic crime could focus on their area without being diverted to other investigations. The co-housing of police and prosecutors (S5) is part of the structure, but the reason for that structure is mentioned in S4. \n\nSo the main reason is stated in S4: to safeguard the expertise of experienced police officers and prosecutors who were often assigned to other types of investigations. Therefore, the citation would be [S4]. \n\nI should check if there are other sentences that contribute. S3 mentions that SECA focuses on serious economic crime with emphasis on financial markets, but that's more about their focus than the structure's reason. S5 is about the structure (co-housing) but the reason is in S4. \n\nSo the answer is that the main reason was to safeguard the expertise of experienced police officers and prosecutors, as per S4. Therefore, the citation is [S4]."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking how SECA contributes to combating economic crime beyond investigations. So I need to look through the supporting context and find information that's not just about investigations but other aspects.\n\nLooking at the passage, [S2] mentions that SECA is tasked to monitor and analyse economic crime trends, initiate joint action between authorities, and propose legislative changes. That sounds like things beyond just investigations. Then [S3] talks about focusing on serious economic crime, especially financial markets and recovering proceeds, but that might be part of investigations. \n\n[S4] is about the history, setting up in 1998 to keep experts from being diverted. Not sure if that's relevant. [S5] and [S6] are about their structure. [S7] and [S8] mention their organizational structure, but [S8] is about the number of employees. \n\nWait, the question is about contributions beyond investigations. So [S2] definitely has two points: monitoring trends, joint action, and proposing legislation. The answer should include those. Also, maybe [S3] mentions recovering proceeds, but that might be part of investigations. The user wants things beyond investigations. So the main points are monitoring trends, initiating joint actions, and proposing legislative changes. \n\nSo the statement would be something like SECA contributes by monitoring economic crime trends, initiating joint actions between authorities, and proposing legislative changes. The citations would be [S2]. Wait, [S2] says \"monitor and analyse economic crime trends, initiate joint action between authorities and propose legislative changes\". So that's one sentence with three actions. So the citation is [S2]. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other sentences. [S3] mentions recovering proceeds, but that's part of their focus. The question is about beyond investigations. So maybe recovering proceeds is part of their work but not sure if it's beyond investigations. The answer should stick to what's explicitly mentioned in the context. So the main answer is from [S2]."
