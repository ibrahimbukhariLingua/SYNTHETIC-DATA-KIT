      "chunk": "[S1] Richard Sharp (executive)\n\n\n# Richard Sharp (executive)\n\n\n\n**Richard L. [S2] \"Rick\" Sharp** (April 12, 1947 – June 24, 2014) was an American business and retail executive who served as the CEO of Circuit City, a former consumer electronics retail chain, from 1986 to 2000. [S3] In 1993, Sharp co-founded CarMax, the largest used car retailer in the United States, which grew to more than 135 locations with revenue of $12.5 billion by 2013. [S4] He was also a founding investor and member of the board of directors of Crocs, a footwear company. [S5] ## Early life and education\n\nSharp was born in Washington D.C., on April 12, 1947, and raised in nearby Alexandria, Virginia. [S6] He graduated from the former George Washington High School in Alexandria in 1965. [S7] Sharp attended the University of Virginia, where he studied electrical engineering during the middle of the 1960s. [S8] However, he dropped out to pursue computer science, a program which was not offered by the University of Virginia at the time. [S9] He later explained to the *Richmond Times-Dispatch* that he lost interest in the original major, \"One semester, I went to class and I got B grades. [S10] The second semester, I had no interest.\" Sharp initially spent much of his time playing pool and poker. [S11] He never completed a college degree, but did enroll in computer courses at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, from 1968 to 1970 and studied advanced management at Harvard University in 1985. [S12] ## Career\n\nSharp founded a computer hardware and software business development company when he was just 27 years old. [S13] He was first hired by Circuit City as an executive vice president in 1982. [S14] He served as Circuit City's chief executive from 1986 to 2000. [S15] Under Sharp, Circuit City's annual revenue grew from $175 million to 10.6 billion during his fourteen-year tenure. [S16] The number of brick-and-mortar stores also increased from 69 in 1988 to more than 600 locations by 2000. [S17] Sharp also moved Circuit City from its core consumer electronics business into new ventures, such as home security. [S18] Critics have argued that the move into these new ventures caused Circuit City to lose focus amid growing competition. [S19] Sharp retired as Circuit City's CEO in 2000 and left the company's board in 2002. [S20] All Circuit City stores closed in 2009 due to competition from other retailers, such as Best Buy, and e-commerce. [S21] In a 2013 interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Sharp criticized the choices made by the company's executives after he left the company, \"It is a sad thing...They made some stupid decisions after I left.\"\n\nRick Sharp, the then chief executive of Circuit City, delivered a speech to a conference held by J. [S22] D. [S23] Power and Associates in the early 1990s. [S24] Following his speech, Sharp conceived of a potential Circuit City expansion into the automotive retail business. [S25] Sharp led a team of Circuit City executives who created a used car retailer focused on two main ideas: no haggling and a huge inventory. [S26] The team rejected several proposed names, including \"Honest Rick’s Used Cars\" and \"Sharp Motors\" before choosing CarMax. [S27] Co-founded by Sharp in 1993, CarMax grew to $12.5 billion in annual sales at approximately 135 locations by 2013. [S28] Sharp hired Thomas J. [S29] Folliard as one of CarMax's first employees. [S30] Folliard has served as the president and chief executive of CarMax from 2006 until 2016, when Folliard retired. [S31] Sharp was a founding investor and member of the board of Crocs, which was founded in 2002. [S32] He also established an investment firm, V-Ten Capital Partners. [S33] In 2008, Sharp was inducted into the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame. [S34] ## Personal life",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking for Richard Sharp's full name and his birth and death dates. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find that information.\n\nFirst, the passage starts with \"Richard Sharp (executive)\" which is probably his full name. Then, in sentence S2, it mentions \"Richard L. [S2] \"Rick\" Sharp\" – so his full name is Richard L. \"Rick\" Sharp. The birth and death dates are in the same sentence: \"April 12, 1947 – June 24, 2014\". \n\nI should check if there are any other mentions of his dates elsewhere, but looking through the rest of the context, the other sentences talk about his career and early life, but the birth and death dates are specifically in S2. The citation for that sentence would be [S2]. \n\nSo the answer should state his full name as Richard L. \"Rick\" Sharp with the dates April 12, 1947, to June 24, 2014, citing sentence S2. I need to make sure there are no other citations needed here. The other sentences mention his early life, like being born in Washington D.C., but the exact dates are in S2. So the correct citation is [S2]."

There's a sentence that says, \"In 1993, Sharp co-founded CarMax, the largest used car retailer in the United States...\" That seems like the answer. Then, the same sentence mentions that by 2013, CarMax had revenue of $12.5 billion. \n\nWait, there's another part that says, \"Co-founded by Sharp in 1993, CarMax grew to $12.5 billion in annual sales at approximately 135 locations by 2013.\" So both sentences [S3] and [S28] mention CarMax and the revenue. But the question is about the company and its revenue. So the answer is CarMax with $12.5 billion. \n\nI need to check if there are other companies mentioned. The context also mentions Crocs, but that was a founding investor, not co-founded. The question specifies \"co-founded,\" so Crocs isn't the answer. The answer is CarMax. \n\nNow, the citations. The first mention is [S3], and another in [S28]. So the statement should cite both. Let me make sure there's no other sentences. The rest of the context talks about his career, early life, etc., but not the company and revenue. So the correct citations are [S3] and [S28]. \n\nSo the answer should be: Richard Sharp co-founded CarMax in 1993, and by 2013, its revenue was $12.5 billion. The citations are [S3] and [S28]."

The rest of the context mentions CarMax and other ventures, but those are separate from Circuit City's revenue growth under Sharp. So the answer should be based on S16."

Then, the next sentence says, \"Critics have argued that the move into these new ventures caused Circuit City to lose focus amid growing competition.\" That's S19. \n\nSo the new venture mentioned is home security. The criticism is that it caused a loss of focus. Are there any other ventures mentioned? The context also talks about CarMax, but that's a separate company he co-founded, not under Circuit City. The question specifically asks about Circuit City's expansion under Sharp, so CarMax might not be relevant here. \n\nDouble-checking the sentences. The key sentences are S18 and S19.

Then it mentions that he co-founded CarMax in 1993, which is the used car retailer. The outcome would be the creation of CarMax. The citations here are S22, S23, S24, and S25. But the question is about the outcome, which is the expansion leading to CarMax. The sentence about conceiving the expansion is S25, and the co-founding is mentioned in S3. However, the direct link between the speech and the outcome is in S25. Also, the part where it says \"Following his speech, Sharp conceived...\" is the immediate outcome. Then the next sentences talk about the team creating the used car retailer, which is CarMax. So the answer should mention that the speech led to the conception of the expansion, which resulted in CarMax. The citations would be S24 and S25, maybe S22 and S23 as well. But the exact outcome is the creation of CarMax, which is cited in S3 and S28. However, the direct outcome from the speech is the conception, so the citations related to that part are S24 and S25. I need to check the exact sentences. The user wants the answer with citations. So the statement would be that the outcome was the conception of the expansion into automotive retail, leading to CarMax. The citations for the conception are [S24][S25], and the creation of CarMax is [S3][S28]. But the question is about the outcome of the speech, which is the expansion idea. So maybe just the first part. Let me make sure. The answer should be that the speech led to the idea of expanding into automotive retail, which resulted in the creation of CarMax. So the citations would be S24 (the speech) and S25 (conceiving the expansion), and then S3 and S28 for CarMax's founding. But the user might need each sentence to have its own citations. So the answer would be a statement that the outcome was the expansion into automotive retail, leading to CarMax's creation, with citations from the relevant sentences."
