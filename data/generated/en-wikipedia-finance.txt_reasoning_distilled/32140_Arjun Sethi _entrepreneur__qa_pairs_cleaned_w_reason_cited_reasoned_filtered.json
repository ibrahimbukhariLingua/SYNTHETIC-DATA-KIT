      "chunk": "Chunk:\n\n[S1] Arjun Sethi (entrepreneur)\n\n\n# Arjun Sethi (entrepreneur)\n\n\n\n**Arjun Sethi** (born January 15, 1983) is an American internet entrepreneur, investor and executive. [S2] He is co-founder and partner at venture capital firm Tribe Capital. [S3] Previously, he was a partner at Social Capital and an executive at Yahoo!, where he launched Yahoo! [S4] Livetext. [S5] Prior, he was co-founder and CEO of MessageMe (acquired by Yahoo!) and was the CEO of Lolapps, the developer behind Ravenwood Fair. [S6] In December 2023, he became Tribe Capital's chairman and CIO. [S7] ## Career\n\n\n### Lolapps\n\nIn 2008, Sethi took the role as CEO of Lolapps, which developed social games on the Facebook platform. [S8] Lolapps developed Ravenwood Fair which had 10 million monthly active users. [S9] At its peak, Lolapps had 150 million monthly active users across its portfolio of games. [S10] Lolapps merged with game publisher 6waves in 2011 which made the merged entity 6waves Lolapps the second largest game publisher on Facebook measured by monthly active users after Zynga. [S11] Sethi became Chief Product Officer in 6waves Lolapps, which went on to raise $35 million in funding from Korean gaming company Nexon. [S12] In 2012, 6waves Lolapps laid off most of its development team and Sethi left to join venture capital firm Social Capital as an entrepreneur in residence. [S13] 6waves Lolapps subsequently rebranded itself as 6waves, dropping Lolapps from its name. [S14] In January 2022, Stillfront Group acquired 6waves for $201M. [S15] ### Angel investments\n\nSethi began angel investing at Lolapps. [S16] He is considered one of the top angel investors in Silicon Valley. [S17] His angel investments include Opendoor, Gusto and Long-Term Stock Exchange. [S18] ### MessageMe and Yahoo\n\nIn 2012, Sethi became co-founder and CEO of mobile messaging app MessageMe. [S19] MessageMe reached five million users within 75 days of launch. [S20] The company raised close to $12 million across two rounds of funding led by Greylock Partners. [S21] MessageMe's rapid growth led to Facebook revoking its access to the Facebook Platform\u2019s \u201cFind Friends\u201d functionality for competitive reasons. [S22] Leaked internal Facebook emails expressed concern about resulting negative publicity for Facebook, particularly given Sethi\u2019s relationship with Social Capital and previous position at Lolapps. [S23] Yahoo acquired MessageMe in 2014 for a price between $30 million and $40 million,\nshut down the app MessageMe, and put Sethi and the ex-MessageMe team to work on a Yahoo messaging app meant to compete with Snapchat and WhatsApp. [S24] Yahoo's acquisition of MessageMe was part of CEO Marissa Mayer's larger strategy to bring in new talent via small startup acquisitions. [S25] In 2015, Sethi and the former MessageMe team launched Yahoo! [S26] Livetext, an audio-free video messaging app. [S27] It never gained significant traction and Yahoo shut down the product in 2016. [S28] ### Social Capital\n\nIn early 2016, Sethi left Yahoo to join Social Capital as an investing partner focused on consumer startups. [S29] At Social Capital, Sethi backed the firm's investments in and served on the board of directors of Carta, Relativity Space, Cover, and CryptoMove. [S30] On February 8, 2024, he released Termina, an AI software platform for investors to perform quantitative due diligence on potential investments. [S31] The program is used by \"sovereign governments, sovereign wealth and pension funds, family offices and private fund managers.\"\n\n\n## Tribe Capital\n\nIn 2018, three former Social Capital investing partners, Sethi, Ted Maidenberg and Jonathan Hsu, left to form Tribe Capital with $200 million targeted for its first fund. [S32] Tribe invests in early-stage startups and uses quantitative data to inform investment decisions. [S33] Tribe raised $335 million for its second fund and $394 million for its third fund. [S34] As of December 2023, Tribe has approximately $1.6 billion in assets under management, about 20% of which is invested in India.",
      "question": "What is Arjun Sethi's current role at Tribe Capital?",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking about Arjun Sethi's current role at Tribe Capital. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the sections of the passage. The user mentioned that each sentence is labeled with [S1], [S2], etc. So I'll check each relevant sentence.\n\nLooking at the \"Tribe Capital\" section. The passage says: \"In 2018, three former Social Capital investing partners, Sethi, Ted Maidenberg and Jonathan Hsu, left to form Tribe Capital with $200 million targeted for its first fund.\" That's [S32]. Then later, there's a sentence: \"In December 2023, he became Tribe Capital's chairman and CIO.\" That's [S6]. \n\nWait, the question is about his current role. The passage also mentions that in the \"Career\" section under Tribe Capital, but the latest info is from December 2023. Since the current year is 2023, unless there's a more recent update, but the context provided doesn't have information beyond that. So according to the given data, his role as chairman and CIO is mentioned in [S6]. \n\nAnother sentence in the Tribe Capital section says \"He is co-founder and partner at venture capital firm Tribe Capital.\" That's [S2]. But then later, [S6] says he became chairman and CIO in December 2023. So the current role would be both co-founder and partner, plus chairman and CIO? Or maybe the roles are separate. \n\nBut the question is specifically about his current role. The passage states both [S2] and [S6]. However, [S6] is more recent (December 2023) compared to [S2], which is part of the general info. So the answer should include both roles, but need to check if they are still current. Since the context doesn't mention any changes after December 2023, those roles would be current. \n\nSo the answer would be that he is a co-founder and partner, and also chairman and CIO. But I need to check the exact sentences. The user wants citations for each sentence. So each statement should have its own citations. \n\nSo the answer would be: Arjun Sethi is co-founder and partner at Tribe Capital [S2], and he became Tribe Capital's chairman and CIO in December 2023 [S6]. But the question is about his current role. So both roles are current. Therefore, the statement should combine these, citing both [S2] and [S6]. Wait, but the user's response format requires each sentence to be in <statement> tags with their own citations. So if the answer is two separate sentences, each with their own citations. Or maybe one sentence combining both roles with both citations. \n\nThe user's example shows that a sentence can have multiple citations. So the answer could be: \"Arjun Sethi is co-founder and partner at Tribe Capital and serves as its chairman and CIO.\" with citations [S2][S6]. But I need to check if the sentences are separate. The original context has [S2] and [S6] as separate sentences. So maybe the answer should have two statements: one for co-founder and partner with [S2], and another for chairman and CIO with [S6]. \n\nBut the question is asking for his current role. So both roles are current. Therefore, the answer should mention both roles, each with their respective citations. So the final answer would have two statements, each with their own citations."

      "answer": "<statement>The price range for Yahoo!'s acquisition of MessageMe was between $30 million and $40 million.<cite>[S24]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the price range for Yahoo!'s acquisition of MessageMe. I need to find the relevant information in the provided supporting context.\n\nLooking through the chunks, there's a section titled \"MessageMe and Yahoo\".

The price range is between $30 million and $40 million. I should make sure there's no other mention of the price elsewhere. Scanning through the other sentences, [S25] talks about the acquisition being part of Mayer's strategy but doesn't mention the price. So the answer is in [S24]. \n\nThe user wants the answer in the specified format with citations. So the statement should be \"The price range for Yahoo!'s acquisition of MessageMe was between $30 million and $40 million.\" and cite [S24]. \n\nI need to check if there are any other sentences that might contribute, but I don't think so. The rest of the context is about Sethi's career, other companies, etc. So the correct citation is [S24]."

      "question": "Why did Yahoo! shut down the Yahoo! Livetext app?",
      "answer": "<statement>Yahoo! shut down the Yahoo! Livetext app because it never gained significant traction.<cite>[S28]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's try to figure out why Yahoo! shut down the Yahoo! Livetext app. The question is asking for the reason behind the shutdown. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of Yahoo! Livetext and its shutdown. Looking at the sections, there's a part under \"MessageMe and Yahoo\" where it says: \"In 2015, Sethi and the former MessageMe team launched Yahoo! [S26] Livetext, an audio-free video messaging app. [S27] It never gained significant traction and Yahoo shut down the product in 2016. [S28]\"\n\nSo the key sentence here is [S28], which states that Yahoo shut down Livetext because it \"never gained significant traction.\" That seems to be the direct reason. The context doesn't mention any other reasons like financial issues, strategic shifts, or external factors. The main point is that the app didn't attract enough users or success, leading to its shutdown.\n\nI should check if there are other sentences that might contribute. For example, the part about Yahoo's acquisition of MessageMe being part of Marissa Mayer's strategy to bring in talent via acquisitions. But that's more about the acquisition rather than the shutdown of Livetext. The other sentences about Livetext's launch and lack of traction are the main points. \n\nSo the answer should cite [S28] as the reason. The statement would be that Yahoo shut down Livetext because it didn't gain significant traction. No other citations are needed here since the context directly states that."

      "answer": "<statement>As of December 2023, Tribe has approximately $1.6 billion in assets under management, about 20% of which is invested in India.<cite>[S3]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking what percentage of Tribe's assets under management is invested in India as of December 2023.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The user mentioned that each sentence is labeled with [S1], [S2], etc. So I should scan each of these sentences to find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the chunks, [S3] says: \"As of December 2023, Tribe has approximately $1.6 billion in assets under management, about 20% of which is invested in India.\" That seems directly relevant. The percentage mentioned here is 20%, and it's specifically about the assets under management invested in India. The date here is December 2023, which matches the question's timeframe.\n\nI should check if there are any other sentences that might mention this percentage. Let me quickly scan through the others. [S1] talks about investments in startups, [S2] mentions fund raises, [S4]-[S6] list investments but not percentages, [S7] mentions board positions, [S8]-[S13] discuss other programs and roles, [S14]-[S16] talk about later events in 2023 and 2024. [S17] is about Nibiru, which is a different entity. \n\nSo the only sentence that mentions the percentage is [S3]. The answer should be 20%, cited from [S3]. The other details in [S3] like the total AUM of $1.6B are extra, but the question is specifically about the percentage invested in India. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other conflicting information. Since none of the other sentences mention the percentage, [S3] is the only citation needed. The answer is straightforward here."

S7 mentions he's on the board of Kraken and Docker, but again, not sure if they're follow-ons. \n\nS8 talks about the Firstlook program, which is a co-investment program, but that's more about the program than specific investments. S9 and S10 mention a SPAC raising and another IPO, but those might be different. \n\nS12 mentions Tribe Crypto Labs, which is an incubator, but not sure if that's a follow-on investment. S16 says he was appointed co-CEO of Kraken, which is a board position, not an investment. \n\nS16 also mentions Nibiru, co-founded in 2022, which is a separate entity. The question is about follow-on investments after initial ones. The key here is that S5 specifically mentions \"followed on to his investments in Carta, Relativity Space, and Cover,\" which indicates that these are follow-on investments. \n\nSo the answer should include Carta, Relativity Space, and Cover. The citations would be S5. Also, maybe check if there are others. But the other sentences don't explicitly mention follow-on investments. The answer should be those three companies with citation [S5]."

Let me go through them one by one. \n\nStarting from the beginning: [S1] talks about Tribe's investment in early-stage startups, but doesn't list specific companies. [S2] mentions the funds raised, not companies. [S3] is about assets under management, not companies. [S4] mentions SFOX as the first investment. [S5] lists Carta, Relativity Space, and Cover. [S6] says \"Other Tribe investments include FTX, Kraken, Applied Intuition, EquipmentShare, Pipe Technologies, Docker, Republic, Instabase, and Momentus.\" That seems like the list we need. Then [S7] mentions Kraken and Docker again, but those are already in [S6]. \n\nSo the answer should be the companies listed in [S6]. The question is about \"other\" investments, so maybe excluding the ones mentioned earlier like SFOX, Carta, etc. But the user just wants the companies listed as other investments, which is specifically in [S6]. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other sentences that list more companies. Checking the rest: [S8] talks about Firstlook, [S9] mentions SPAC raising, [S10] mentions Odell Beckham Jr., [S11] about Kapital, [S12] Tribe Crypto Labs, [S13] transition to chairman, [S14] Kapital again, [S15] Kraken co-CEO, [S16] Nibiru, [S17] Nibiru details. \n\nSo the only sentence with the list is [S6]. Therefore, the answer should be the companies in [S6], cited as [S6]. The user might be looking for that specific list. I should present each company as part of a sentence with the citation. Wait, the instructions say each sentence is inside <statement> tags, and each sentence has its own citations. So the sentence that lists all those companies is [S6], so the statement would be that sentence, and the citation is [S6]. But the user might want each company listed individually? No, the original sentence [S6] lists them all together. So the answer is the sentence from [S6], cited as [S6]. \n\nSo the correct answer is the sentence in [S6], which includes FTX, Kraken, Applied Intuition, EquipmentShare, Pipe Technologies, Docker, Republic, Instabase, and Momentus. Therefore, the statement would be that sentence with [S6] citation."

[S7] says \"Sethi serves on the board of directors of Kraken and Docker.\" That's a direct mention. So Kraken and Docker are two boards. \n\nLooking further, [S14] states that he joined the board of fintech firm Kapital. So that's another one. Then [S15] mentions he was appointed co-CEO of Kraken, but that's a leadership role, not a board. The question is about boards, so maybe co-CEO isn't a board position. \n\nAre there any others? [S16] talks about Nibiru, but it's about co-founding a protocol, not a board. The rest of the chunks don't mention other boards. So the answer should be Kraken, Docker, and Kapital. \n\nWait, let me check again. [S7] mentions Kraken and Docker. [S14] mentions Kapital. Any others? [S9] mentions Sethi as CEO of Tribe, but that's a CEO role, not a board. [S13] says he transitioned to chairman and CIO, but chairman might be part of the board. However, the question is about serving on the board. The text says \"chairman and chief investment officer,\" which might be a leadership role within the company, but the board membership is separate. The original text doesn't explicitly say he's on the board of Tribe, just that he was CEO and then chairman. So maybe Tribe isn't included. \n\nSo the answer is Kraken, Docker, and Kapital. The citations would be [S7], [S14], and maybe [S15] if co-CEO is considered a board role, but the text doesn't specify that. The answer should stick to the explicit mentions. So the correct citations are [S7] for Kraken and Docker, and [S14] for Kapital."

The other sentences mention other funds or investments, but not the specific amount for Tribe Crypto Labs. Therefore, the answer should be $25 million, cited from [S12]."

      "chunk": "Chunk:\n\n[S1] Tribe invests in early-stage startups and uses quantitative data to inform investment decisions. [S2] Tribe raised $335 million for its second fund and $394 million for its third fund. [S3] As of December 2023, Tribe has approximately $1.6 billion in assets under management, about 20% of which is invested in India. [S4] At Tribe, Sethi made its first investment in cryptocurrency trading platform SFOX. [S5] He also followed on to his investments in Carta, Relativity Space, and Cover. [S6] Other Tribe investments include FTX, Kraken, Applied Intuition, EquipmentShare, Pipe Technologies, Docker, Republic, Instabase, and Momentus. [S7] Sethi serves on the board of directors of Kraken and Docker. [S8] In 2020, Tribe launched its investing program Firstlook to allow accredited investors to co-invest in selected companies alongside Tribe. [S9] In March 2021, Tribe and Arrow Capital co-sponsored a SPAC raising $240 million, led by Sethi as CEO. [S10] Tribe filed plans for a second SPAC IPO later that month, with Odell Beckham Jr. [S11] serving as strategic advisor. [S12] In July 2022, Tribe announced that it launched an incubator program Tribe Crypto Labs, which had raised $25M from outside investors. [S13] In December 2023, he transitioned from CEO of Tribe Capital to chairman and chief investment officer (CIO). [S14] That month, he also joined cofounders Rene Saul, Fernando Sandoval and Eder Echeverria on the board of fintech firm Kapital, which was named to the 2024 CNBC Disruptor 50 list list five months later. [S15] In October 2024, he was appointed co-CEO of Kraken, serving alongside David Ripley. [S16] ## Nibiru\n\nIn September 2022, Sethi co-founded a crypto derivatives trading protocol named Nibiru. [S17] He raised $7.5M at a $100M valuation.",
      "question": "What was the valuation and funding amount for Nibiru, the crypto derivatives trading protocol co-founded by Sethi?",
      "answer": "<statement>In September 2022, Sethi co-founded a crypto derivatives trading protocol named Nibiru. [S17] He raised $7.5M at a $100M valuation.<cite>[S17]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the valuation and funding amount for Nibiru, the crypto derivatives trading protocol co-founded by Sethi. I need to check the supporting context provided.\n\nLooking through the chunks, there's a section labeled [S16] which mentions \"## Nibiru\" followed by a sentence [S17]: \"In September 2022, Sethi co-founded a crypto derivatives trading protocol named Nibiru. [S17] He raised $7.5M at a $100M valuation.\" \n\nSo the valuation is $100M and the funding amount is $7.5M. The citation here is [S17]. I need to make sure there's no other information elsewhere. Scanning through the rest of the context, I don't see any other mentions of Nibiru's valuation or funding. The other sentences talk about Tribe's investments, other companies, but not Nibiru. \n\nTherefore, the answer should state that Nibiru had a $100 million valuation and raised $7.5 million, citing [S17]. The sentence needs to be in the specified format with the citation inside <cite> tags."
