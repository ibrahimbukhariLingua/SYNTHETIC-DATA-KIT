  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about AirTag in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main topic is AirTag, a French startup acquired by Morpho in 2015. They were involved in mobile shopping and payments. The history section mentions their founding in 2006, funding rounds, and key products like their NFC SDKs. They worked with big companies like Reebok, McDonald's, Carrefour, and KFC. There's also a mention of their growth and eventual dissolution in 2018. The criticism part points out that they weren't the first with an NFC SDK, as others had existing ones.\n\nSo the key points are: AirTag's role in mobile payments, their NFC technology, partnerships with major brands, growth and funding, and their dissolution. Also, the criticism about their SDK claims. I need to condense this into a concise summary, making sure to highlight the main topic, key concepts like NFC, partnerships, and the outcome of the company. Avoid minor details like specific dates unless they're crucial. Check for the main company's purpose, achievements, and end.\n</think>\n\nAirTag was a French startup founded in 2006 that specialized in mobile shopping and payments, pioneering NFC (near-field communication) technology through software development kits (SDKs) and partnerships with major brands like McDonald's, Carrefour, and KFC. The company developed innovative solutions such as loyalty point systems, smartphone-based payments, and mobile wallets, positioning itself as a leader in early mobile commerce. Despite growth and notable collaborations, AirTag faced criticism for overstating its technological firsts, as pre-existing NFC SDKs existed prior to its 2008 launch. The company was acquired by Morpho (a Safran subsidiary) in 2015 but was later dissolved in 2018 without liquidation. Its legacy lies in advancing NFC integration in retail and mobile payments during the early 2010s.",

      "thinking": "Okay, so the user is asking in which year AirTag was acquired by Morpho. Let me check the supporting context provided.\n\nLooking at the passage, the first chunk mentions \"AirTag (company)\" and then in sentence S1, it says \"AirTag was a French startup that was acquired by Morpho, at the time a Safran subsidiary, in 2015.\" That seems to directly answer the question. The year mentioned here is 2015. \n\nI should verify if there's any other mention of the acquisition year elsewhere. Scanning through the rest of the context, there's a sentence S2 that talks about the acquisition, but it's part of the same paragraph as S1. The other sentences mention events in 2006, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2018, but none of those are related to the acquisition. The key sentence is S1, which clearly states 2015. \n\nSo the answer should be 2015, cited from S1. I need to make sure there are no other citations. The user's format requires each statement to have its citations. Since the answer is in S1, the citation is [S1]. I'll structure the response accordingly."

I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the chunks, there's a section labeled \"History\" with several sentences. Let me go through them one by one. \n\nSentence S4 mentions that AirTag was founded in 2006. Then S5 says, \"As of late 2012, investors had provided \u20ac6 million in seed capital, following a second-round in 2011 when it secured \u20ac4 million.\" That seems directly relevant. The question is about the seed capital by late 2012, and this sentence states \u20ac6 million. \n\nI should check if there are other sentences that mention funding. S3 is part of the history section but just mentions the founders. S6 and S7 talk about the NFC SDK launch in 2008. S8 mentions another SDK in 2012. S9 is about hardware for payments. Then later sentences talk about partnerships with Reebok, Nokia, McDonald's, Carrefour, etc. But the key part is S5. \n\nThe question is specifically about seed capital. The sentence in S5 mentions \u20ac6 million in seed capital as of late 2012. The second part mentions a second-round in 2011 with \u20ac4 million, but the question isn't asking about the 2011 round. So the answer should be \u20ac6 million, cited from S5. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other mention of seed capital elsewhere.

[S5] In October 2008, AirTag launched what it called the first NFC software development kit (SDK). [S6] It included an NFC reader and four types of NFC tags. [S7] In 2012, the company launched another SDK. [S8] This one included hardware for smartphone-based payments. [S9] In 2009, AirTag and its partner Netsize launched *Airtag Pad*, an in-store terminal for clients to check their loyalty points, ask about tailored products, etc. [S10] Reebok hired it for its line of *Go Sport* stores. [S11] Nokia C7, the world's first smartphone with an NFC chip, was able to pick up loyalty points and discount coupons on the phone, through a partnership with AirTag. [S12] AirTag built McDonald's France smartphone app *GoMcDo* which was one of the first to integrate with Apple's Passbook soon after the latter's initial launch with iOS 6 in 2012. [S13] In 2012, Carrefour's mobile app for near-field communication (NFC) purchasing was built by AirTag. [S14] In 2013, French newspaper *L'Express* ranked AirTag among the top 30 French internet startups. [S15] That same spring, AirTag launched KFC\u2019s first mobile wallet to order and pay via smartphone; three months later, 90% of those installing the app were placing orders through it. [S16] Late that year, AirTag admitted it was not profitable. [S17] In 2014, the company had 50 employees when it launched mobile commerce applications for Dia France and for Brioche Dor\u00e9e.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking in what year AirTag launched KFC\u2019s first mobile wallet for smartphone orders.

Therefore, the answer should be 2013. I need to make sure there's no other mention of KFC elsewhere. Let me check again. The rest of the context talks about other collaborations like McDonald's, Carrefour, Reebok, etc., but the KFC mention is specifically in S16. So the answer is 2013."

The supporting context provided is about AirTag, a French startup. I need to look through the sentences to find the answer.\n\nLooking at the sentences, [S13] mentions that AirTag built McDonald's France smartphone app *GoMcDo* which was one of the first to integrate with Apple's Passbook soon after the latter's initial launch with iOS 6 in 2012. That seems to directly answer the question. The company here is McDonald's France, but the app was built by AirTag. However, the question is about the company whose app integrated with Passbook. So the answer would be McDonald's France. But wait, the app is called *GoMcDo*, which is McDonald's app. So the company is McDonald's. But the sentence says AirTag built the app. But the question is about the company's app, not the developer. So the answer should be McDonald's. However, maybe the answer is AirTag? Wait, the question says \"company's app\", so the app belongs to the company. So if AirTag built the app for McDonald's, then the company is McDonald's. But I need to check if the context says that. The sentence says \"AirTag built McDonald's France smartphone app *GoMcDo* which was one of the first to integrate with Apple's Passbook...\" So the app is McDonald's app, developed by AirTag. Therefore, the answer is McDonald's. But maybe the answer is AirTag? Hmm. Wait, the question is phrased as \"company's app\", so the app is of the company. So the company here is McDonald's France. But the answer might be McDonald's. Alternatively, maybe the answer is AirTag, but that's the developer. Let me check the exact wording. The question is \"Which company's app was one of the first to integrate with Apple's Passbook?\" So the app belongs to the company. So the answer is McDonald's. But the context says that AirTag built the app. However, the app is McDonald's app. So the answer should be McDonald's. But I need to check if there's any other mentions. Let me check other sentences. There's also [S14] about Carrefour's mobile app built by AirTag. But the question is about Passbook integration. So [S13] is the key. So the answer is McDonald's France. But maybe the answer is AirTag? No, because AirTag is the company that developed the app, not the company that owns the app. The app is for McDonald's. So the answer should be McDonald's. However, sometimes in such contexts, the developer might be considered, but the question says \"company's app\", which implies the app is owned by the company. Therefore, the answer is McDonald's. But I need to make sure. Let me check the exact sentence again: \"AirTag built McDonald's France smartphone app *GoMcDo* which was one of the first to integrate with Apple's Passbook...\" So the app is McDonald's, so the company is McDonald's. Therefore, the answer is McDonald's. But the supporting context's sentence [S13] is the one that mentions this. So the citation would be [S13]. But the user's example shows that the citation is in the format [S1], [S2], etc. So the answer should be McDonald's, with citation [S13]. But wait, the question is about the app that integrated with Passbook. The app is GoMcDo, developed by AirTag for McDonald's. So the company is McDonald's. Therefore, the answer is McDonald's, cited from [S13]."

      "question": "Which smartphone manufacturer partnered with AirTag to enable loyalty points and coupons?",
      "answer": "<statement>Nokia C7, the world's first smartphone with an NFC chip, was able to pick up loyalty points and discount coupons on the phone, through a partnership with AirTag.<cite>[S12]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking which smartphone manufacturer partnered with AirTag to enable loyalty points and coupons. I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the sentences. Let's start from the beginning. Sentence S1 mentions AirTag as a French startup acquired by Morpho. S2 says it's a mobile shopping and payments provider. Then in S3, the history section starts. \n\nLooking for mentions of partnerships. S10 talks about AirTag and its partner Netsize launching Airtag Pad. But the question is about a smartphone manufacturer. Then S12 mentions Nokia C7, the world's first smartphone with an NFC chip, which could pick up loyalty points and discounts through a partnership with AirTag. That seems relevant. \n\nAnother mention is in S13 about AirTag building McDonald's France app GoMcDo. But McDonald's is a restaurant, not a smartphone manufacturer. Then S16 mentions KFC's mobile wallet, but again, KFC is a restaurant. \n\nSo the key sentence here is S12. It specifically states that Nokia C7, the first smartphone with NFC, partnered with AirTag for loyalty points and coupons. The answer should be Nokia. Let me check if there are other possible mentions. \n\nLooking through the rest, S14 mentions Carrefour's app, but again, not a phone manufacturer. The rest of the sentences don't mention other manufacturers. So the answer is Nokia. The citation would be S12."

      "answer": "<statement>In 2012, the company launched another SDK. This one included hardware for smartphone-based payments.<cite>[S8][S9]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the name of the NFC SDK launched by AirTag in 2012. I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of SDKs and the year 2012. Let's go through each sentence:\n\n[S1] Introduces AirTag as a company. Not relevant here.\n[S2] Says they were a mobile shopping and payments provider. Still not about the SDK.\n[S3] History section starts. \n[S4] Founding details. \n[S5] Funding details. \n[S6] Mentions that in October 2008, AirTag launched the first NFC SDK. The name isn't mentioned here, just that it was the first.\n[S7] Describes what the 2008 SDK included. Still no name.\n[S8] Says in 2012, the company launched another SDK. This is the one from 2012. The sentence says \"another SDK\" but doesn't give a name. \n[S9] Describes what the 2012 SDK included (hardware for payments). \n[S10] Talks about Airtag Pad in 2009. \n[S11] Reebok using their service. \n[S12] Nokia C7 and partnership with AirTag. \n[S13] GoMcDo app for McDonald's. \n[S14] Carrefour's NFC app in 2012. \n[S15] Ranking by L'Express. \n[S16] KFC's mobile wallet. \n[S17] Not profitable. \n[S18] 2014 employees. \n[S19] Dissolution in 2018.\n\nSo, the 2012 SDK is mentioned in [S8] and [S9]. However, the passage doesn't explicitly state the name of the SDK. It only mentions that in 2008 they launched the first NFC SDK, and in 2012 another SDK. The 2012 SDK is described as including hardware for smartphone-based payments. But there's no specific name given for either SDK. \n\nWait, the question is asking for the name of the 2012 SDK. But the supporting context doesn't provide a name. The user might be expecting that the answer is \"another SDK\" but that's not a name. Alternatively, maybe there's a detail I missed. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the sentences again: [S6] mentions \"the first NFC software development kit (SDK)\" but doesn't name it. [S8] says \"another SDK\" but again no name. The rest of the sentences talk about features but not the name. \n\nSo, based on the given context, the answer is that the name of the 2012 NFC SDK isn't provided. However, the user is asking for the name, so maybe there's an implicit assumption here. Wait, perhaps the SDK launched in 2008 was called something, and the 2012 one was another version? But the context doesn't specify. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that there's no name mentioned. But the question assumes that there was a name. Hmm. Maybe I need to check if any of the other sentences refer to it. For example, the 2012 SDK might be part of the Carrefour app or GoMcDo, but those are apps, not the SDK. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that the supporting context does not provide the name of the 2012 NFC SDK. However, the user might expect that the answer is \"NFC SDK\" but that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the name isn't mentioned. But the question is phrased as if there is a name. \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that the SDK was called the \"NFC SDK\" but that's just the general term. The passage doesn't give a specific name. Therefore, the correct answer would be that the name isn't provided in the context. But the user might have expected a different answer. However, based on the given information, I have to go with what's there. \n\nSo the answer would be that the name isn't specified. But the question is asking for the name, so maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the SDK launched in 2012 is referred to as the \"NFC SDK\" but that's not a specific name. \n\nIn this case, the answer would be that the supporting context does not mention the specific name of the 2012 NFC SDK. However, since the user is expecting an answer, perhaps the answer is that the SDK was called the \"NFC SDK\" but that's not accurate. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that there's no information provided. \n\nBut according to the instructions, I have to answer based on the supporting context. Since the context doesn't mention the name, the answer would be that the name isn't provided. However, the user might have intended that the answer is \"another SDK\" but that's not a name. \n\nWait, the question says \"the name of the NFC SDK\". If the context doesn't provide the name, then the answer is that it's not mentioned. But maybe I missed a sentence. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the entire context again:\n\n- [S6] \"launched what it called the first NFC software development kit (SDK).\"\n- [S8] \"launched another SDK. This one included hardware for smartphone-based payments.\"\n\nSo, the 2008 SDK is called the \"first NFC SDK\", but the 2012 one is just referred to as \"another SDK\". There's no specific name given. Therefore, the answer is that the name isn't provided in the context. However, the user might be expecting that the answer is \"NFC SDK\" but that's the general term. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the 2012 SDK. Since the context doesn't mention a specific name, the answer would be that the name isn't provided. However, the user might have intended that the answer is \"NFC SDK\" but that's not correct. \n\nIn this case, I have to answer based on the given information. So the answer is that the name of the 2012 NFC SDK is not mentioned in the supporting context. But the user might have expected a different answer. However, according to the instructions, I must use the supporting context. Therefore, the answer is that there's no name provided."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking in which year AirTag's KFC mobile wallet saw 90% of users placing orders through the app. I need to find the specific year mentioned in the supporting context.\n\nLooking through the provided chunks, there's a sentence that mentions KFC's mobile wallet.

But when was the launch? The sentence says \"That same spring,\" which would be the same spring as the previous events. \n\nWait, the previous sentences mention 2013, like S15: \"In 2013, French newspaper *L'Express* ranked AirTag among the top 30 French internet startups.\" Then S16 says \"That same spring,\" so the launch of KFC's mobile wallet would be in 2013.
