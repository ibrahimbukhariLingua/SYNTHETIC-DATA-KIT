  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Dvoinoye Gold Mine in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main points seem to be: it's an underground mine in Russia, owned by Kinross Gold, acquired in 2010, built at a cost of $360 million, started production in 2013. The history mentions it was previously a surface mine, then they did drilling and a feasibility study. Operation details include processing at Kupol, 1000 tonnes per day, producing 300k ounces of gold-equivalent annually. Reserves are over 2 million tonnes with specific grades.\n\nI should make sure to mention the location, owner, acquisition year, construction cost, production start, operational details, and reserves. Need to keep it concise, avoiding too many numbers but including key figures. Also, note that it's part of Kinross's operations and the relationship with the Kupol mine. Check for any other important aspects like the transition from surface to underground or the processing capacity increase. Avoid minor details like the exact time of the feasibility study. Make sure each sentence covers a distinct aspect: ownership, history, operations, and reserves.\n</think>\n\nThe **Dvoinoye Gold Mine**, located in Russia's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug and owned by Canadian company Kinross Gold, is an underground operation established in 2013 after being acquired in 2010 for $360 million. Originally a surface mine, it now processes 1,000 tonnes of ore daily at the nearby Kupol facility, producing up to 300,000 troy ounces of gold-equivalent annually. The mine features proven and probable reserves of over 2 million tonnes of gold ore at 19 grams per tonne, with additional lower-grade resources. Its development expanded Kupol's processing capacity by 1,000 tonnes per day, integrating it into Kinross's broader mining operations in the region.",

[S2] The mine is owned by Canadian mining company Kinross Gold and is approximately 100 kilometres (60 mi) from their Kupol Gold Mine. [S3] Originally the site of a surface mine, Kinross acquired the property in 2010, and built the underground mine at a cost of US$360-million. [S4] The mine began production in 2013. [S5] ## History\n\nIn 2010 Kinross acquired the rights to the Dvoinoye property, which is located approximately 100 kilometres (60 mi) from another Kinross mine, Kupol. [S6] The property was purchased from Northern Gold; an open pit mine previously operated on the site, producing 250 tonnes per day, six months per year. [S7] After acquisition, Kinross completed diamond drilling on the property, and a feasibility study. [S8] Production began at the mine in October 2013, and the mine was built \"on time and on budget\" at a cost of US$360-million. [S9] ## Operation\n\nThe Dvoinoye mine is expected to operate at the rate of 1000 tonnes of ore per day, which will be processed at Kupol, producing a gold and silver doré. [S10] The mine is expected to produce up to 300,000 troy ounces (9,300,000 g) of gold-equivalent per year during the first three years of production. [S11] To handle the additional ore from Dvoinoye, capacity at the mineral processing facility at Kupol was increased by an additional 1000 tonnes per day, yielding a total capacity of 4,500 tonnes per day. [S12] ## Reserves and resources\n\nThe Dvoinoye Gold Mine has a NI 43-101 proven and probable reserves of more than two million tonnes of gold ore, at a grade of approximately 19 grams per tonne gold and 28.5 grams per tonne silver.

[S10] The mine is expected to produce up to 300,000 troy ounces (9,300,000 g) of gold-equivalent per year during the first three years of production. [S11] To handle the additional ore from Dvoinoye, capacity at the mineral processing facility at Kupol was increased by an additional 1000 tonnes per day, yielding a total capacity of 4,500 tonnes per day. [S12] ## Reserves and resources\n\nThe Dvoinoye Gold Mine has a NI 43-101 proven and probable reserves of more than two million tonnes of gold ore, at a grade of approximately 19 grams per tonne gold and 28.5 grams per tonne silver. [S13] There is an additional 280,000 tonnes in the measured, indicated, and inferred categories, although at a lower grade.",
      "question": "What was the production schedule of the previous open pit mine at Dvoinoye?",
      "answer": "<statement>The previous open pit mine at Dvoinoye produced 250 tonnes per day for six months per year.<cite>[S6]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the production schedule of the previous open pit mine at Dvoinoye. First, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find any mentions of the open pit mine's production schedule.\n\nLooking at the chunks, [S6] mentions that the property was purchased from Northern Gold; an open pit mine previously operated on the site, producing 250 tonnes per day, six months per year. That seems to directly answer the question. The key details here are the production rate of 250 tonnes per day and the duration of six months per year. \n\nI should check if there's any other information in other sentences that might relate to the production schedule. For example, [S4] talks about the mine beginning production in 2013, but that's about the underground mine after Kinross acquired it. [S8] mentions the start of production in October 2013, but again, that's the underground mine. The previous open pit mine's details are specifically in [S6]. \n\nSo the answer should state that the previous open pit mine produced 250 tonnes per day for six months per year. The citation needed is [S6]. I need to make sure there are no other citations. The user's question is specifically about the previous open pit mine, so other sentences about the current underground mine aren't relevant here. \n\nTherefore, the correct statement would be: \"The previous open pit mine at Dvoinoye produced 250 tonnes per day for six months per year.\" With the citation [S6]."

That seems to directly answer the question. \n\nI should check if there's any other information that might be relevant. The other sentences talk about the mine's history, production rates, reserves, etc., but not the processing capacity. So S12 is the key here. The answer is 4,500 tonnes per day.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking when production at the Dvoinoye mine officially began. I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the sentences, [S4] says \"The mine began production in 2013.\" Then [S8] mentions \"Production began at the mine in October 2013...\" So both sentences mention 2013, but [S8] specifies the month as October. The question is about when production officially began, so the exact date might be important. However, the answer might depend on whether the year is sufficient or if the month is needed. The user didn't specify, but since [S8] gives a more precise date, that's probably the correct citation. \n\nWait, the user wants the answer with citations. So the answer would be October 2013, citing [S8]. But also, [S4] says 2013. However, since [S8] is more specific, maybe that's the one to use. Let me check the sentences again. \n\nThe passage has \"The mine began production in 2013.\" [S4] and \"Production began at the mine in October 2013...\" [S8]. So the official start is October 2013. Therefore, the answer should be October 2013 with [S8]. But maybe both [S4] and [S8] are correct? However, the user's instructions say to provide citations for each sentence. So if the answer is in [S8], then cite that. But if the answer is 2013, then [S4] and [S8] both have that info. But the exact answer is October 2013, so [S8] is the right citation. \n\nSo the statement would be \"Production at the Dvoinoye mine officially began in October 2013.\" with [S8]. But I need to check if there's any other sentences. [S4] is 2013, but [S8] is October 2013. So the correct answer is October 2013, citing [S8]. \n\nI think that's it.
