      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking about Ahmed Abu Ismail's profession. I need to look through the supporting context provided.\n\nFirst, the passage starts with \"Ahmed Abu Ismail\" and then in [S1] it mentions he was an Egyptian economist and politician who served as minister of finance in the 1970s. That seems like a direct answer. The question is about his profession, so economist and politician are the key terms here. \n\nLooking through the rest of the context, there are mentions of his work in universities, establishing a college, and his role as finance minister. But the initial sentence in [S1] clearly states his professions. The other parts might add more details, but the main answer is in [S1]. \n\nI should check if there are other sentences that might contribute. For example, [S2] talks about his role as minister of finance, but that's part of his career. The question is about his profession, which is more general. So the answer is economist and politician. The citation would be [S1]. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other conflicting information. The rest of the sentences mention his work experiences, but not his profession. So the correct citation is [S1]."

But the exact wording in the context is important. The answer should be based on the citations provided. So the sentences [S9] and [S12] are the ones that mention his economic approach. \n\nSo the answer would be that he supported a liberal economic approach, and also advocated for price control and increased subsidies. But the question is phrased as \"economic approach,\" which might refer to the main one. However, since the context mentions both, I should include both. \n\nTherefore, the statement should be that Ahmed Abu Ismail supported a liberal economic approach, and also advocated for price control and increased subsidies. The citations would be [S9] and [S12]. Wait, but [S12] says he adhered to a liberal approach but was an advocate of price control and subsidies. So the main approach is liberal, but he also supported those measures. \n\nSo the answer should state that he supported a liberal economic approach, and also advocated for price controls and subsidies. The citations would be [S9] and [S12]. Let me check if there are other sentences. \n\nNo, the other sentences don't mention his economic approach. So the answer is based on those two sentences. Therefore, the correct citations are [S9] and [S12]."

It mentions his support for a liberal economy and criticism of the public sector's inefficiency. \n\nAnother part says, \"Although Ismail acted as the leader of opponents of the public economy policy implemented by President Anwar Sadat, he was appointed finance minister...\" which is [S10]. But this is more about his role as an opponent of Sadat's policies, not directly his stance on the public sector itself. \n\nThen there's a sentence: \"Ismail adhered to a liberal economic approach, but he was an advocate of the price control and the increased level of subsidies to improve the economy of Egypt when he was in office.\" That's [S12]. This shows his economic approach, but it's more about price control and subsidies rather than the public sector specifically. \n\nThe key point is the criticism of the public sector's inefficiency. So the main citation would be [S9]. Are there other sentences? Let me check again. \n\nThe question is specifically about his stance on the public sector. The sentence in [S9] directly addresses that. The other sentences mention his liberal approach and opposition to certain policies, but the direct answer is in [S9]. \n\nSo the answer should state that he supported a liberal economy and criticized the inefficiency of the Egyptian public sector, citing [S9]. I need to make sure there are no other relevant sentences. \n\nI think that's it. The other parts talk about his tenure as finance minister and reasons for dismissal, but not his stance on the public sector. So the correct citation is [S9]."

In [S16], it says he was named head of the Far East Bank and served at the Parliament as a member of the New Wafd Party. So that's a direct mention of the New Wafd Party. \n\nI should make sure there's no other mention elsewhere. The rest of the context talks about his education, career steps, and death, but nothing else about political parties. The answer should be the New Wafd Party, cited from [S16]."

The main reason is his opposition to IMF policies. The other sentences talk about his career and other positions, but the dismissal reason is specifically in [S13].
