Key concepts are his positions, education, and the timeline of his career. I should highlight his roles as Minister of Finance, his education, and his subsequent positions after leaving the ministry. Also, note his death date. Need to make sure the summary is concise, covers the main points without extra details. Check for any important names or positions that are crucial. Avoid mentioning his classmates unless it's relevant, but since it's not central, maybe skip that. Make sure the sentences flow and cover all key aspects.\n</think>\n\nSheu Yu-jer (1952\u20132020) was a Taiwanese politician who served as Minister of Finance from 2016 to 2018, appointed by Premier Lin Chuan.

      "answer": "<statement>Sheu Yu-jer was born on 27 October 1952 and died on 15 February 2020.<cite>[S1][S8]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking for Sheu Yu-jer's date of birth and death. I need to find that information in the provided supporting context.\n\nLooking at the passage, the first sentence under the chunk says: \"Sheu Yu-jer (Chinese: \u8a31\u865e\u54f2; pinyin: *X\u01d4 Y\u00fazh\u00e9*; 27 October 1952 \u2013 15 February 2020) was a Taiwanese politician...\" So here, the dates are mentioned as 27 October 1952 and 15 February 2020. \n\nThe question is straightforward, just asking for the birth and death dates. The answer is directly provided in that first sentence. Now, I need to check if there are any other mentions of these dates elsewhere in the context. Scanning through the other sentences, [S2] talks about education, [S3] about career, [S4] mentions his role in the Ministry, [S5] about being deputy finance minister, [S6] his appointment as finance minister, [S7] replacement, [S8] his death. Wait, [S8] says \"He died on 15 February 2020, aged 67.\" So the death date is confirmed again in [S8]. But the birth date is only in the first sentence. \n\nSo the birth date is 27 October 1952, and the death date is 15 February 2020. The citations for the birth date would be [S1], and the death date would be [S1] and [S8]. But the user is asking for both dates, so the answer should include both. \n\nI need to structure the answer with each date and their respective citations. The first sentence in the passage has both dates, so that's the main citation. Then [S8] confirms the death date. So the statement would be: \"Sheu Yu-jer was born on 27 October 1952 and died on 15 February 2020.\" The citations would be [S1] for both, and [S8] for the death. Wait, but the death is mentioned in both [S1] and [S8]. So the citations for the death date would be [S1][S8], and the birth date is only [S1]. \n\nBut the user is asking for both dates. So the answer should have two statements? Or one statement with both dates. The example given in the response format shows a single sentence with citations. So maybe combine both dates into one sentence. \n\nSo the correct statement would be: \"Sheu Yu-jer was born on 27 October 1952 and died on 15 February 2020.\" With citations [S1][S8] for the death and [S1] for the birth. But how to handle that? Wait, the citations are attached to the entire sentence. If the sentence includes both dates, then the citations would be [S1] for the birth and [S1][S8] for the death. But the format requires each sentence to have its own citations. So maybe split into two sentences? But the user's question is one question. \n\nAlternatively, since the birth date is only in [S1], and the death date is in [S1] and [S8], the combined sentence would have [S1][S8] as citations. But the birth date is only in [S1], so maybe the citations should include [S1] for the birth and [S1][S8] for the death. However, the citation tags are at the end of the sentence. So the entire sentence would have [S1][S8], since both dates are in those sentences. But the birth date is only in [S1], and the death is in [S1] and [S8]. So the correct citations would be [S1] and [S8] for the death, but the birth is only [S1]. However, the sentence includes both dates, so the citations would be [S1][S8], as both sentences contribute to the information. \n\nI think that's the way to go. So the final answer would be a single statement with both dates and citations [S1][S8]."

But in the supporting context, the citations are [S1], [S2], [S3], etc. So the sentence that includes the pinyin is part of [S1]? Or is it a separate sentence?\n\nThis is a bit confusing. The user's supporting context might have the pinyin in the same sentence as [S1], but the way it's written, [S1] is just \"Sheu Yu-jer\", and then the next part is the detailed description. However, in the actual text, the pinyin is mentioned in the same paragraph. But according to the given citations, the pinyin is in [S1] because that's where the name is first introduced. Alternatively, maybe the pinyin is in a separate citation. But according to the structure provided, the citations are [S1] to [S8], each corresponding to a sentence. \n\nLooking at the exact text:\n\n[S1] Sheu Yu-jer\n\n\n# Sheu Yu-jer\n\n\n\n**Sheu Yu-jer** (Chinese: \u8a31\u865e\u54f2; pinyin: *X\u01d4 Y\u00fazh\u00e9*; 27 October 1952 \u2013 15 February 2020) was a Taiwanese politician who served as the Minister of Finance from 20 May 2016 until 16 July 2018. [S2] ## Education\n\nSo the line with the pinyin is part of the same sentence as [S1]? Or is [S1] only \"Sheu Yu-jer\" and the rest is a separate sentence? It's unclear, but based on the way the user presented the supporting context, [S1] is \"Sheu Yu-jer\", then the next line is the detailed description. However, the citations [S2] onwards start after that. So the sentence that includes the pinyin is part of [S1]? Or is it a separate sentence? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pinyin is in [S1], but the user's structure might have the pinyin in the same sentence as [S1]. Since the user's instruction says that each sentence is inside <statement> tags with citations. So the answer would be that the pinyin is X\u01d4 Y\u00fazh\u00e9, and the citation is [S1], because that's where the name is first mentioned. However, if the pinyin is in a separate sentence, maybe [S1] is just the name, and the pinyin is in another sentence. But according to the given text, the pinyin is in the same line as the Chinese name, which is part of the same paragraph. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but based on the user's provided citations, the pinyin is in the same sentence as [S1], so the citation would be [S1]. Therefore, the answer is X\u01d4 Y\u00fazh\u00e9 with citation [S1]."

Then [S5] mentions that by 2013, he was deputy finance minister under Chang Sheng-ford. So the position before deputy finance minister would be the director-general of the Taxation Agency. The answer should be that he was the director-general of the Taxation Agency. The citations would be [S4] for that position. Wait, but does the context mention anything else? Let me check again. The education part is [S2] and [S3], but the career part is [S4] to [S8]. Yes, [S4] is the director-general, and [S5] is the deputy finance minister. So the answer is director-general of the Taxation Agency, cited from [S4]."

That seems directly relevant. The question is about his successor, so Su Jain-rong would be the answer. \n\nI should check if there are any other mentions. [S6] mentions he was appointed finance minister by Premier Lin Chuan in April 2016, but that's about his appointment, not the successor. [S8] talks about him leading the Taiwan Futures Exchange after his tenure. So the key sentence here is [S7], which states he was replaced by Su Jain-rong. \n\nNo other names are mentioned in the context as succeeding him. So the answer should be Su Jain-rong, cited from [S7]."
