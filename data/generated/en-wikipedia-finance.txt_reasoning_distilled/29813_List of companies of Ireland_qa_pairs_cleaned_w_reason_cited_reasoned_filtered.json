  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about companies in Ireland. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document is a list of notable companies in Ireland, divided into sections like \"About companies in Ireland,\" \"Largest firms,\" and \"Notable firms.\" The main topic is the various companies based in Ireland, including their types, sectors, and some key details.\n\nFirst, the introduction explains that the list includes companies from the entire island, covering both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. It mentions the different types of companies: private limited, public limited, and company limited by guarantee. Also, there are statutory corporations and mutual bodies included. The document notes that some companies are subsidiaries of foreign firms, which is significant because Ireland's economy relies heavily on multinational companies.\n\nIn the \"Largest firms\" section, there's a table with Fortune Global 500 companies, like Johnson Controls, Accenture, CRH plc, and Medtronic. These are highlighted for their revenue and employment impact. The \"Notable firms\" section has a detailed table with companies across various industries, including their status (active or defunct), headquarters, and other notes.\n\nKey concepts to focus on: the different company types, the inclusion of multinational subsidiaries, the economic importance of these companies, and the sectors they operate in. Also, the distinction between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland's regulatory bodies.\n\nI need to condense this into 3-5 sentences. Start with the main purpose of the document, mention the categories of companies, note the inclusion of multinational subsidiaries, and highlight the sectors and economic impact. Make sure to mention the structure of the list and the key examples provided.\n</think>\n\nThis document provides an overview of notable companies in Ireland, categorizing them by type (private, public, or limited by guarantee) and sector, while acknowledging the distinction between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland's regulatory frameworks. It highlights multinational subsidiaries, such as Intel Ireland and Accenture, which play significant roles in the Irish economy through employment and tax contributions. The list includes major firms like CRH plc and Medtronic, alongside diverse industries ranging from technology and finance to utilities and retail, emphasizing both domestic and international entities. Key examples of large companies and their economic impact are detailed, alongside defunct or state-sponsored organizations, reflecting Ireland's business landscape.",

[S8] * Company limited by guarantee, this type of company has members, not shareholders, as such generally limited to trade associations and not-for-profit bodies.

[S13] For more details on this form of governance, see state-sponsored bodies of Ireland. [S14] Some mutual bodies, such as building societies, are also included on this list. [S15] Some entries such as Three Ireland and Intel Ireland are subsidiaries of foreign companies.

      "answer": "<statement>Irish companies fall into three categories: Private limited companies, Public limited companies, and Company limited by guarantee.<cite>[S5][S6][S7][S9]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the three categories of Irish companies mentioned in the text. I need to look through the supporting context provided and find where the categories are listed.\n\nStarting from the top, the passage mentions \"Irish companies fall into three categories:\" followed by three bullet points. Let me check each one. The first bullet says \"Private limited companies, which carry the suffix 'Limited' (Ltd) or 'Teoranta' (Teo), and whose shares are privately held.\" That's the first category. The second bullet is \"Public limited companies, which carry the suffix 'plc' or 'cpt' and whose shares may be listed on a stock exchange.\" That's the second. The third bullet states \"Company limited by guarantee, this type of company has members, not shareholders, as such generally limited to trade associations and not-for-profit bodies.\" That's the third category. \n\nNow, I need to make sure there are no other categories mentioned. Scanning through the rest of the text, there's information about subsidiaries, statutory corporations, and mutual bodies, but those seem like additional types or exceptions, not the three main categories. The answer should be the three listed under the \"three categories\" section. Each of these bullets is in the text with their respective citations. The first is cited as [S6], the second [S7], and the third [S9]. So the answer should list these three categories with their citations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking, \"What are statutory corporations, and why are they included in the list?\" So I need to find the part of the supporting context that explains statutory corporations and their inclusion.\n\nLooking through the passage, I see a section that starts with \"Some entries on this list may be statutory corporations...\" which is sentence S13. That seems like the key part. Let me read that again. It says statutory corporations are a business form governed by a board appointed by an Irish Government minister under specific legislation. They aren't formal companies but are treated as such and included because they're usually large businesses. Then there's a citation to S13 and maybe others?\n\nWait, the question also asks why they're included. The passage mentions they're included because they're large businesses. Also, the note says to see state-sponsored bodies of Ireland for more details, but that's S14. However, the direct answer is in S13. Are there other sentences that mention statutory corporations? Let me check the rest.\n\nNo, the rest of the context talks about other company types, like private limited, public limited, etc., but the specific info on statutory corporations is only in S13. So the answer should be based on that sentence. The user wants the answer with citations. So the first part about what they are comes from S13, and the reason for inclusion is also in S13. Are there any other citations? The sentence in S13 mentions \"see state-sponsored bodies of Ireland\" which is S14, but that's a reference, not part of the definition. So the citation for the definition would be [S13], and the reason for inclusion is also [S13]. \n\nWait, the user's question has two parts: definition and reason for inclusion. The passage combines both in S13. So the answer should be a statement citing S13 for both parts. Let me make sure there's no other info. The rest of the context doesn't mention statutory corporations again. So the answer is in S13. Therefore, the statement should be: \"Statutory corporations are a business form governed by a board appointed by an Irish Government minister under a particular piece of legislation, not formally companies but treated as such. They are included in the list because they are usually large businesses.\" Cited as [S13]."

      "chunk": "Chunk:\n\n[S1] List of companies of Ireland\n\n\n# List of companies of Ireland\n\n\n\nThis is a **list of notable companies based in Ireland**, or subsidiaries according to their sector. [S2] It includes companies from the entire island. [S3] The state of the Republic of Ireland covers five-sixths of the island, with Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, covering the remainder in the north-east. [S4] Each has separate regulatory and registration authorities. [S5] ## About companies in Ireland\n\nIrish companies fall into three categories:\n\n* Private limited companies, which carry the suffix \"Limited\" (Ltd) or \"Teoranta\" (Teo), and whose shares are privately held. [S6] * Public limited companies, which carry the suffix \"plc\" or \"cpt\" and whose shares may be listed on a stock exchange. [S7] Where this is the case, it is noted in this article. [S8] * Company limited by guarantee, this type of company has members, not shareholders, as such generally limited to trade associations and not-for-profit bodies. [S9] Companies in the Republic of Ireland must be registered with the Companies Registration Office, and comply with the provisions of the *Companies Acts*. [S10] Companies in Northern Ireland must be registered with the Department for the Economy's Companies Registry. [S11] Certain Northern Ireland organisations are dealt with on a UK-wide basis and are dealt with by Companies House. [S12] Some entries on this list may be *statutory corporations* - a business form governed by a board appointed by an Irish Government minister under a particular piece of legislation - not formally companies as such, but are effectively treated as such and are included on this list as they are usually large business. [S13] For more details on this form of governance, see state-sponsored bodies of Ireland. [S14] Some mutual bodies, such as building societies, are also included on this list. [S15] Some entries such as Three Ireland and Intel Ireland are subsidiaries of foreign companies. [S16] These subsidiaries are listed because the Irish economy is significantly dependent on foreign companies in comparison to other nations and these multinational companies are major Irish employers and tax contributors - Intel Ireland employs over 5000 people. [S17] ## Largest firms\n\nThis list shows firms in the Fortune Global 500, which ranks firms by total revenues reported before 31 March 2017. [S18] Only the top five firms (if available) are included as a sample. [S19] | Rank | Image | Name | 2016 revenues (US$M) | Employees | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 272 | Johnson Controls | 37,674 | 209,000 | Multinational industrial conglomerate manufacturing electronics for the automotive industry and commercial electrical equipment. [S20] After a full merger with Tyco International in 2016, the firm established headquarters in Cork, Ireland. [S21] |\n| 305 | Accenture | 34,798 | 384,000 | Global professional services and management consulting firm. [S22] The company formed as a spin-off from the U.S.-based Arthur Andersen in 1989 and moved their headquarters to Dublin in 2009. [S23] Accenture's clients include more than three-quarters of the Fortune Global 500. [S24] |\n| 363 | CRH plc | 29,973 | 86,778 | Diversified building materials and construction holding company. [S25] The firm provides heavyside products and materials (cement, aggregates and concrete), lightside products (glass, fencing), and retail product distribution (merchant chains). [S26] |\n| 377 | Medtronic | 28,833 | 98,017 | Multinational medical device design, development and manufacturing. [S27] company. [S28] After acquiring Dublin-based Covidien in 2014, the firm moved their headquarters from the United States to Ireland while retaining operational headquarters in Fridley, Minnesota. [S29] |\n\n\n## Notable firms\n\nThis list includes notable companies with primary headquarters located in the country. [S30] The industry and sector follow the Industry Classification Benchmark framework. [S31] Organizations which have ceased operations are included and noted as defunct.",
      "question": "Which multinational companies are highlighted as major employers in Ireland?",
      "answer": "<statement>Three Ireland and Intel Ireland are highlighted as multinational companies that are major employers in Ireland, with Intel Ireland employing over 5000 people.<cite>[S16][S17]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which multinational companies are highlighted as major employers in Ireland. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of multinational companies and their employment status. The user mentioned \"major employers,\" so I should focus on sentences that link these companies to significant employment in Ireland.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section under \"Largest firms\" with a table. The entries there might be relevant. Let me check each row. \n\nThe first entry is Johnson Controls. The note says they merged with Tyco International in 2016 and have headquarters in Cork. But I don't see a direct mention of employment numbers here. The next entry is Accenture. The note mentions they moved headquarters to Dublin in 2009 and have clients including Fortune Global 500 companies. Still, no specific employment stats. \n\nCRH plc's entry talks about their business areas but no employment info. Medtronic's entry states they acquired Covidien in 2014 and moved headquarters to Ireland. However, the key part might be in the sentence before the table. \n\nWait, there's a sentence earlier in the context: \"Some entries such as Three Ireland and Intel Ireland are subsidiaries of foreign companies. These subsidiaries are listed because the Irish economy is significantly dependent on foreign companies in comparison to other nations and these multinational companies are major Irish employers and tax contributors - Intel Ireland employs over 5000 people.\" \n\nThis sentence directly mentions Intel Ireland as a major employer with over 5000 employees. Also, Three Ireland is mentioned, but the specific employment number is given for Intel. The question is about multinational companies highlighted as major employers. So Intel Ireland is one. \n\nAre there others? The table includes companies like Johnson Controls, Accenture, CRH plc, Medtronic. But the only specific mention of employment is Intel. However, the user might be looking for the ones explicitly stated. \n\nWait, the sentence also says \"these multinational companies are major Irish employers\" referring to the subsidiaries. So Three Ireland and Intel Ireland are examples. But only Intel has the employment number. The question is about which companies are highlighted. So both Three Ireland and Intel Ireland are mentioned here. \n\nBut in the table, there's also Accenture, which is a multinational. The note says Accenture's clients include Fortune Global 500, but not specifically about employment in Ireland. However, the question is about companies highlighted as major employers. The only explicit mention is Intel Ireland with 5000 employees. \n\nBut the user might also consider the companies in the Fortune Global 500 list as major employers. However, the passage doesn't explicitly state that. The key sentence is [S17] which mentions Intel Ireland employs over 5000. So the answer should include Intel Ireland. \n\nWait, the question is about multinational companies. Three Ireland is a subsidiary of a foreign company (Vodafone), and Intel Ireland is a subsidiary of Intel. Both are mentioned in [S16] and [S17]. So the answer would be Three Ireland and Intel Ireland. But the passage specifically mentions Intel Ireland's employment number. \n\nSo the answer should list these two companies. The citations would be [S16] and [S17]. Let me check the sentences again. \n\n[S16] says \"Some entries such as Three Ireland and Intel Ireland are subsidiaries of foreign companies.\" [S17] states \"these multinational companies are major Irish employers and tax contributors - Intel Ireland employs over 5000 people.\" \n\nTherefore, the multinational companies highlighted are Three Ireland and Intel Ireland. But the citation for Three Ireland isn't explicitly stating they are major employers, only that they are subsidiaries. However, the sentence [S17] refers to \"these multinational companies\" which includes both, but only Intel's employment is mentioned. \n\nSo the answer should include both, but the citation for their status as major employers would be [S17] for Intel and possibly [S16] for being subsidiaries. However, the exact mention of being major employers is only in [S17] for Intel. \n\nBut the question is about which companies are highlighted as major employers. Since the passage says \"these multinational companies are major Irish employers\" (referring to the subsidiaries like Three Ireland and Intel Ireland), even though only Intel's employment is quantified. So both are highlighted. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be Three Ireland and Intel Ireland, with citations [S16] and [S17]. But need to check if the sentence in [S17] is the one that mentions them as major employers. \n\nYes, [S17] says \"these multinational companies are major Irish employers and tax contributors - Intel Ireland employs over 5000 people.\" So the companies are Three Ireland and Intel Ireland, cited in [S16] and [S17]. \n\nSo the final answer should list both companies with those citations."

      "question": "Which company is part of the International Airlines Group?",
      "answer": "<statement>Aer Lingus is part of the International Airlines Group (Spain).<cite>[S4]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking which company is part of the International Airlines Group. I need to look through the supporting context provided.\n\nLooking at the table in the supporting context, there's a list of companies with their details. The user is asking about the International Airlines Group, so I should check the \"Notes\" column for any mentions of that group. \n\nScrolling through the entries, I notice that Aer Lingus is listed with the note \"Flag carrier, part of International Airlines Group (Spain)\". That seems to be the direct answer. Let me double-check if there are any other companies mentioned as part of IAG. \n\nAnother entry is Aer Lingus Regional, but its note says it's part of Aer Lingus, not IAG directly. Other airlines like Ryanair are there, but they don't mention IAG. So the main one here is Aer Lingus. \n\nThe citation would be from the sentence where Aer Lingus is mentioned. In the context, the entry for Aer Lingus is in the chunk under [S4] and the specific note is in that row. So the citation should be [S4] or maybe [S3] if the note is part of that section. Wait, the chunk starts with [S1] and the table is under [S4]. Let me check again.\n\nThe chunk provided starts with \"## Notable firms\" and the table is under that. The specific entry for Aer Lingus is in the table, which is part of the chunk. The note about International Airlines Group is in the \"Notes\" column for Aer Lingus. Since the table is part of the chunk, the citation would be [S4], which is the section heading for the table. But the exact sentence where the note is written is in the table row for Aer Lingus. However, the user's instructions say to cite the sentence number. The problem is that the table entries might not be individual sentences but part of the chunk. \n\nWait, the user's supporting context is split into chunks with sentence numbers. The chunk here is labeled [S1], but the actual content under it includes the table. The table's entries are part of the chunk, but each row in the table isn't a separate sentence. However, the note about Aer Lingus being part of IAG is in the \"Notes\" column of the table. Since the entire table is part of the chunk [S1], but the user might have split the chunks differently. Wait, looking back, the chunk provided starts with [S1] and the content is the table. The user's instruction says that each sentence is inside <statement> tags, but in the given context, the table is presented as a markdown table. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The user's example shows that each sentence is in <statement> tags with citations. However, in the provided supporting context, the table is part of the chunk [S1]. The note about Aer Lingus is in the table's \"Notes\" column. Since the user's system might have parsed the table entries as sentences, but in the given context, it's not clear. However, based on the user's example, the answer should cite the specific sentence where the information is found. \n\nAssuming that the entry for Aer Lingus is in the chunk [S1], but the exact sentence might be part of the table. However, since the user's example doesn't have tables, maybe the answer should cite [S4] as the section where the table is located. But the original chunk is labeled [S1]. Wait, the user's supporting context starts with:\n\nChunk:\n\n[S1] |\n\n\n## Notable firms\n\nThis list includes notable companies with primary headquarters located in the country. [S2] The industry and sector follow the Industry Classification Benchmark framework. [S3] Organizations which have ceased operations are included and noted as defunct. [S4] Notable companies\n\nThen the table follows. So the table is under [S4]. Therefore, the entry for Aer Lingus is in the table under [S4]. So the citation would be [S4]. But the exact sentence where Aer Lingus is mentioned is in the table. However, the user's instructions say to cite the sentence number. If the table is considered part of [S4], then the answer would be [S4]. Alternatively, if each row in the table is a separate sentence, but the user hasn't indicated that. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following the structure provided, the answer is Aer Lingus, cited from [S4]."

      "question": "What is the status of the Central Bank of Ireland?",
      "answer": "<statement>The Central Bank of Ireland is a State-owned and Active institution.<cite>[S4]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the status of the Central Bank of Ireland. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nLooking at the chunk given, there's a table with various companies and organizations. The Central Bank of Ireland is listed there. Let me check the row for Central Bank of Ireland. \n\nIn the table, the entry for Central Bank of Ireland has the following details: Industry is Financials, Sector is Banks, Headquarters in Dublin, Founded in 1943, Notes say \"Central bank and financial services regulator\", Status is S, and A. \n\nThe status code here is S and A. But the question is about the status. The note mentions \"Status: P=Private, S=State; A=Active, D=Defunct\". So S likely stands for State-owned, and A for Active. Therefore, the Central Bank of Ireland is a State-owned active institution. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other information elsewhere. The supporting context doesn't have other mentions of the Central Bank of Ireland. The citation would be from the sentence where Central Bank of Ireland is listed. Looking at the chunk, the sentence starts with \"Central Bank of Ireland | Financials | Banks | Dublin | 1943 | Central bank and financial services regulator | S | A |\". That's in the chunk, so the citation is [S1]?\n\nWait, the chunk starts with [S1] |, but the actual content of the chunk is the table. The user's supporting context is a chunk that starts with [S1] and then the table. So the sentence where Central Bank of Ireland is mentioned is part of that chunk. However, the way the citations are structured here is a bit unclear. The initial [S1] might be a label for the entire chunk. But in the context provided, each entry in the table is a separate sentence? Or is the entire table considered one sentence?\n\nWait, the user's instruction says that each sentence is inside <statement> tags, and citations are [S1], [S2], etc. But in the provided supporting context, the chunk is presented as a table. However, the user's example shows that the supporting context has sentences with citations. So perhaps each row in the table is considered a separate sentence? Or maybe the entire table is one sentence. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the [S1] is the first sentence of the chunk, which is the line \"## Notable firms\" and the following text. But the actual data starts after that. The user's supporting context starts with:\n\n[S1] |\n\n\n## Notable firms\n\nThis list includes notable companies with primary headquarters located in the country. [S2] The industry and sector follow the Industry Classification Benchmark framework. [S3] Organizations which have ceased operations are included and noted as defunct. [S4] Notable companies\nStatus: P=Private, S=State; A=Active, D=Defunct\n| Name | Industry | Sector | Headquarters | Founded | Notes | Status | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | |\n| Abrakebabra | Consumer services | Food Retailers & Wholesalers | Dublin | 1982 | Fast-food, part of Abrakebabra Investments | P | A |\n...\n\nSo [S1] is the first line, which is just \"|\", then the next lines have [S2], [S3], [S4]. Then the table starts. So the entry for Central Bank of Ireland is in the table. But the citations in the supporting context are [S1], [S2], etc., which are probably the sentences before the table. However, the actual data in the table might not have citations. But the user's question is about the Central Bank of Ireland's status, which is in the table. \n\nBut according to the supporting context provided, the table entries don't have citations. The citations are in the text before the table. So maybe the answer is that the Central Bank of Ireland's status is State (S) and Active (A), as per the table entry. However, since the table entries aren't labeled with citations, but the text before the table has [S2], [S3], etc., perhaps the information about the status is in the text. But the text says \"Status: P=Private, S=State; A=Active, D=Defunct\" which is part of the chunk. So that line is [S4]? Let me check:\n\nThe supporting context has:\n\n[S1] |\n\n\n## Notable firms\n\nThis list includes notable companies with primary headquarters located in the country. [S2] The industry and sector follow the Industry Classification Benchmark framework. [S3] Organizations which have ceased operations are included and noted as defunct. [S4] Notable companies\nStatus: P=Private, S=State; A=Active, D=Defunct\n| Name | Industry | Sector | Headquarters | Founded | Notes | Status | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | |\n...\n\nSo [S4] is \"Notable companies Status: P=Private, S=State; A=Active, D=Defunct\". So the status definitions are in [S4]. But the actual entry for Central Bank of Ireland is in the table. However, the table entries themselves don't have citations. So the answer would be based on the table entry, but since the table entries aren't cited, perhaps the answer is not directly citable? But the user's instructions say to use the supporting context to answer and provide citations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire table is considered part of the chunk, and the sentence where Central Bank of Ireland is mentioned is part of the chunk. But the chunk's citations are [S1] to [S4], and the table entries are not labeled. So perhaps the answer is that the Central Bank of Ireland's status is State and Active, as per the table, but there's no citation. However, the user's example shows that even if a sentence doesn't have a citation, the cite tag is left empty. \n\nBut the user's question is about the status of the Central Bank of Ireland. The answer is in the table entry for Central Bank of Ireland, which is part of the supporting context. However, since the table entries don't have explicit citations, maybe the answer is not citable. But the user might expect that the status is defined in the text before the table, which is [S4]. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire table is considered part of the chunk, and the sentence where Central Bank of Ireland is mentioned is part of the chunk, but since the chunk's citations are only up to [S4], perhaps there's no citation. But the user's example shows that if a sentence doesn't have a citation, the cite tag is empty. \n\nSo the answer would be: The Central Bank of Ireland is a State-owned (S) and Active (A) institution. The status is defined in the table entry, but since the table entries aren't cited, the citation is empty. However, the status definition is in [S4]. But the actual status of the Central Bank is in the table. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. But according to the supporting context provided, the Central Bank of Ireland's status is listed as \"S\" and \"A\" in the table. The status definitions are given in the text before the table, which is [S4]. So maybe the answer is that the status is State and Active, citing [S4]. But the actual data is in the table. However, the user's instructions say to use the supporting context to answer. \n\nAlternatively, since the table is part of the chunk, and the chunk's citations are [S1] to [S4], but the table entries themselves are not labeled, perhaps the answer is not citable. But the user's example shows that even if a sentence doesn't have a citation, the cite tag is left empty. So the answer would be:\n\n<statement>The Central Bank of Ireland is a State-owned and Active institution.<cite></cite></statement>\n\nBut maybe the status is defined in the text, so [S4] is the citation. However, [S4] is \"Notable companies Status: P=Private, S=State; A=Active, D=Defunct\". So the definition of the codes is in [S4]. Therefore, the answer would be that the Central Bank of Ireland's status is S (State) and A (Active), citing [S4]. \n\nBut the actual status of the Central Bank is in the table entry. However, the user's instructions might require citing the sentence where the information is found. Since the table entry itself isn't cited, but the status definitions are in [S4], perhaps the answer is cited as [S4]. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire table is considered part of the chunk, and the sentence where the Central Bank is mentioned is part of the chunk, but since there's no specific citation for that row, it's not cited. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous, but based on the given information, the best approach is to state the status as per the table and cite [S4] for the status definitions. However, the user might expect that the answer is directly from the table entry, which isn't cited. \n\nIn the absence of clear citations for the table entries, the safest answer is to state the status and leave the citation empty. But the user's example shows that if a sentence doesn't have a citation, the cite tag is empty. Therefore, the answer would be:\n\n<statement>The Central Bank of Ireland is a State-owned and Active institution.<cite></cite></statement>"

      "question": "Which company is a defunct airline and when did it become defunct?",
      "answer": "<statement>Stobart Air is a defunct airline that became defunct in 2021.<cite>[S3]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which company is a defunct airline and when it became defunct. The supporting context provided is a list of companies with their details.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the list for any airlines that are marked as defunct. The status column indicates if a company is defunct (D). Let me scan the \"Industry\" column for \"Airlines\" and check the \"Status\" column.\n\nLooking at the entries:\n\n- Aer Lingus: Status A (Active)\n- Aer Lingus Regional: Status A\n- CityJet: Status A\n- Ryanair: Status A\n- Stobart Air: Status D (Defunct), and the note says \"defunct 2021\"\n- There's also \"Smart Telecom\" which is defunct in 2011, but that's a telecom company, not an airline.\n- Thomas Crosbie Holdings: Defunct 2013, but that's a publishing company.\n- Covidien: Merged in 2016, not an airline.\n- C\u00faram Software: Status D, but it's a software company.\n- IONA Technologies: Status D, software.\n- Meteor: Status D, merged into Eir.\n- O'Briens Irish Sandwich Bars: Active.\n- Doolittles: Liquidated in 2009, but food retail.\n- Stobart Air: The entry says \"defunct 2021\" in the notes. So that's an airline.\n\nSo the answer should be Stobart Air, which became defunct in 2021. Let me check the citations. The information about Stobart Air is in the supporting context. The exact sentence would be the row for Stobart Air. The note mentions \"defunct 2021\" so that's the citation. The relevant sentence is in the chunk provided. Let me check the original context again.\n\nIn the supporting context, the row for Stobart Air is:\n\n| Stobart Air | Consumer services | Airlines | Dublin | 2014 | Regional airline, defunct 2021 | P | D |\n\nSo the citation would be [S?]. Wait, the user provided the supporting context with chunk [S1] to [S4], but the actual data is in the table. However, the initial chunk mentions \"Notable companies\" and the table is part of the supporting context. The user's instruction says to cite the sentence number from the supporting context. But the supporting context here is the entire passage provided. However, the way the user structured it, the chunk is labeled with [S1], [S2], etc., but the actual data is in the table. \n\nWait, looking back, the user provided the supporting context as a chunk with [S1] to [S4], but the table is part of that chunk. However, the exact sentences in the chunk are:\n\n[S1] |\n\n\n## Notable firms\n\nThis list includes notable companies with primary headquarters located in the country. [S2] The industry and sector follow the Industry Classification Benchmark framework. [S3] Organizations which have ceased operations are included and noted as defunct. [S4] Notable companies\n\nBut the table is part of the chunk, but the sentences in the table aren't numbered. However, the user might consider the entire table as part of the supporting context. But according to the instructions, each sentence in the supporting context is numbered. However, the table entries are not individual sentences but part of a table. This is a bit confusing. \n\nBut the user's example shows that the supporting context includes the table, and the citations are based on the sentences in the chunk. However, the actual data in the table isn't numbered. So perhaps the answer should cite [S3] because that's the sentence that mentions defunct companies. But the specific information about Stobart Air is in the table, which isn't explicitly numbered. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user considers each row in the table as a separate sentence. But the original chunk doesn't have numbers for each row. This is a bit ambiguous. However, given the user's example, they might expect that the answer is based on the table entries, and the citations are from the chunk's sentences. Since the chunk's [S3] mentions that defunct companies are included, but the specific company is in the table. However, the user might not have numbered the table rows, so perhaps the answer should cite [S3] as the general reference. But the user might expect the exact row. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire table is considered part of the supporting context, and the answer is derived from the table, but since the user hasn't provided sentence numbers for the table entries, perhaps the answer can't be cited. However, the user's example shows that the answer can have citations even if the exact sentence isn't numbered. \n\nBut given the information, the best approach is to cite [S3] because that's where the defunct companies are mentioned. However, the specific company Stobart Air is in the table, which is part of the supporting context. Since the user's instructions say to use the supporting context's sentence numbers, but the table isn't numbered, maybe the answer should not have a citation. But that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user considers the entire table as part of the supporting context, and the answer is based on the table, but since the sentences in the table aren't numbered, the answer can't be cited. However, the user's example includes citations even if the exact sentence isn't numbered. \n\nThis is a bit of a problem. But given the information, the answer is Stobart Air, defunct in 2021. The supporting context mentions defunct companies in [S3], so maybe that's the citation. But the exact info is in the table. However, the user might not have intended that. Alternatively, maybe the answer should not have a citation, but the user's example shows that even if the sentence is in the table, it's cited. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considers the entire passage as the supporting context, and the answer is derived from the table, but since the table isn't split into numbered sentences, the answer can't be cited. However, the user's instructions say to provide citations of the sentence number. \n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. But given the information, I'll proceed by citing [S3] as the general reference for defunct companies, and the specific company is in the table. However, the user might expect the exact row. But since the rows aren't numbered, perhaps the answer is [S3]. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the answer is in the table, and the citation is [S3] because that's where the defunct status is mentioned. \n\nSo the final answer would be Stobart Air became defunct in 2021, citing [S3]."

      "question": "What is the industry and sector of CRH plc?",
      "answer": "<statement>CRH plc is categorized under the Industrials industry and the Building materials & fixtures sector.<cite>[S1]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the industry and sector of CRH plc. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find that information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the list of companies in the chunk. The table has columns for Name, Industry, Sector, etc. Let me look for CRH plc. Here it is: CRH plc is listed with Industry as \"Industrials\" and Sector as \"Building materials & fixtures\". \n\nI should check if there are any other mentions of CRH plc elsewhere in the text, but from the given data, this seems to be the only entry. The question is straightforward, just asking for the industry and sector. The answer is directly available in the table. \n\nNow, I need to format the answer with the correct citations. The entry for CRH plc is in the chunk, and the sentence number would be [S1] since the table starts under the chunk. Wait, the chunk is labeled [S1], but the actual data in the table might be part of that chunk. However, the user's supporting context shows that the table is part of the chunk, so the citation would be [S1]. But looking at the structure, the table is under the \"Notable firms\" section, which is part of the chunk. So the correct citation is [S1]. \n\nWait, the user's supporting context starts with \"Chunk:\" followed by [S1]. The table is part of that chunk. So the entry for CRH plc is in the chunk, so the citation is [S1]. Therefore, the answer should cite [S1]."

      "question": "What framework do the industry and sector classifications follow?",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking what framework the industry and sector classifications follow. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage. The first sentence in the chunk is [S1], which says, \"The industry and sector follow the Industry Classification Benchmark framework.\" That seems directly relevant. The rest of the sentences talk about different companies, their industries, sectors, and other details, but the key part here is sentence S1. \n\nI should check if there are any other sentences that mention the framework. Looking through the rest, [S2] talks about defunct organizations, and then there's a table with various companies. The table's columns are Name, Industry, Sector, etc., but the actual classification framework isn't mentioned elsewhere. \n\nSo the answer is definitely in S1. The citation would be [S1]. I need to make sure there's no other mention. The user's instructions say to cite the sentence numbers, so only S1 is needed here. The answer should be a statement citing S1."

      "question": "What sector does the 'Airtricity' company belong to?",
      "answer": "<statement>The 'Airtricity' company belongs to the Utilities sector, specifically under the \"Alternative electricity\" sub-sector.<cite>[S3]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking which sector the 'Airtricity' company belongs to. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the list of companies in the table. The companies are listed with their respective Industry, Sector, Headquarters, etc. Let me look for \"Airtricity\" in the Name column. \n\nHere's the entry for Airtricity: \n\n| Airtricity | Utilities | Alternative electricity | Dublin | 1997 | Electricity generation, part of Scottish and Southern Energy (UK) | P | A |\n\nSo, the Sector column for Airtricity is \"Alternative electricity\". But wait, the question is about the sector. However, sometimes sectors and industries can be confused. Let me check the definitions. The first sentence in the chunk says that the industry and sector follow the Industry Classification Benchmark framework. But the exact terms here are \"Industry\" and \"Sector\" as columns in the table. \n\nIn the table, the columns are: Name, Industry, Sector, Headquarters, Founded, Notes, Status. So for Airtricity, the Sector is \"Alternative electricity\". However, sometimes \"Utilities\" might be considered the industry. But the question specifically asks for the sector. \n\nLooking at other entries, like Aer Lingus is in the Consumer services industry, Airlines sector. So the Sector here is a sub-category under the Industry. So for Airtricity, the Sector is \"Alternative electricity\". But I need to confirm if that's the correct answer. \n\nThe user's question is about the sector, so the answer should be \"Alternative electricity\" as per the Sector column. The citation would be [S3] since the table is in the chunk under [S3]. Wait, the chunk starts with [S1], [S2], [S3], etc. The table is part of the chunk, so the sentence where Airtricity is mentioned is in the table. But the chunk's sentences are the ones listed as [S1], [S2], [S3], etc. \n\nLooking at the chunk provided:\n\n[S1] The industry and sector follow the Industry Classification Benchmark framework. \n[S2] Organizations which have ceased operations are included and noted as defunct. \n[S3] Notable companies Status: P=Private, S=State; A=Active, D=Defunct\n| Name | Industry | Sector | Headquarters | Founded | Notes | Status | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | |\n| Abrakebabra | Consumer services | Food Retailers & Wholesalers | Dublin | 1982 | Fast-food, part of Abrakebabra Investments | P | A |\n... (other entries)\n| Airtricity | Utilities | Alternative electricity | Dublin | 1997 | Electricity generation, part of Scottish and Southern Energy (UK) | P | A |\n\nSo the table is part of [S3]. Therefore, the information about Airtricity is in [S3]. Therefore, the citation should be [S3]. \n\nBut the user's question is about the sector, so the answer is \"Alternative electricity\" from the Sector column of the table in [S3]. So the statement would be \"The 'Airtricity' company belongs to the Alternative electricity sector.\" with citation [S3]."

      "question": "Which company's notes state it is part of the 'Big Four banks' and also part of Allied Irish Banks?",
      "answer": "<statement>First Trust Bank's notes state it is part of the 'Big Four banks' and also part of Allied Irish Banks.<cite>[S3]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking which company's notes mention it's part of the 'Big Four banks' and also part of Allied Irish Banks. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The context is a table with various companies, their industries, sectors, headquarters, founding dates, notes, and status. The key here is to check the 'Notes' column for any mentions of 'Big Four banks' and 'Allied Irish Banks'.\n\nStarting from the top, I'll scan each entry. \n\nLooking at Allied Irish Banks (AIB) in the table: the note says \"One of the Big Four banks\". That's one part of the question. But does it mention being part of Allied Irish Banks? Wait, the company name itself is Allied Irish Banks, so maybe the note is just stating it's a Big Four bank. But the question is about a company that is part of both the Big Four and Allied Irish Banks. So maybe another company's note says it's part of AIB and also part of the Big Four.\n\nNext, looking at First Trust Bank: the note says \"One of the Big Four banks, part of Allied Irish Banks\". Ah, here we go. This company is listed as part of the Big Four and also part of AIB. So the answer should be First Trust Bank. \n\nLet me double-check. The question is asking for a company that is part of both. The notes for First Trust Bank mention both. The AIB's note only mentions being part of the Big Four, not the other way around. So the correct answer is First Trust Bank. The citation would be from the row where First Trust Bank is listed, which is [S?]. Wait, the chunk provided has the table with the entries. The entries are numbered as per the chunk. Looking at the chunk, the entries are in the table, but the sentence numbers are from [S1] to [S2]. Wait, the initial chunk starts with [S1] and [S2], but the table is part of the supporting context. However, the way the user provided the context, the table is part of the chunk. But the sentence numbers in the chunk are [S1] and [S2], but the actual data in the table might not be numbered. Wait, the user's supporting context is a chunk that includes the table. However, in the given chunk, the sentences are [S1] and [S2], but the rest is the table. The table entries are not labeled with [S] numbers. So how to cite?\n\nWait, the user's instruction says that the supporting context is provided, and each sentence in the context is labeled with [S1], [S2], etc. But in the given chunk, the first two sentences are [S1] and [S2], then the table starts. However, the table entries are not labeled with [S] numbers. So perhaps the table entries are not part of the numbered sentences. But the user's question is about the notes in the table. \n\nBut according to the problem, the answer must cite the sentence numbers from the supporting context. However, the table entries might not be part of the numbered sentences. This is a bit confusing. Wait, looking back at the user's provided supporting context:\n\nThe chunk starts with:\n\n[S1] The industry and sector follow the Industry Classification Benchmark framework. [S2] Organizations which have ceased operations are included and noted as defunct. [S3] Notable companies...\n\nThen the table follows. So [S3] is the start of the table? Or is [S3] a separate sentence? The way it's written, [S3] is a sentence, then the table. But the table's entries are not numbered. So if the question is about the notes in the table, but the sentences in the chunk are only [S1], [S2], [S3], etc., but the table is part of the context. However, the user's instruction says that the supporting context is given, and the answer must cite the sentence numbers. \n\nBut in this case, the notes about the companies are in the table. However, the table entries are not part of the numbered sentences. Therefore, perhaps the answer cannot be cited? But that can't be. Maybe the user considers the table entries as part of the sentences. Alternatively, maybe the [S3] is the start of the table. Let me check the exact text:\n\nThe chunk is:\n\n[S1] The industry and sector follow the Industry Classification Benchmark framework. [S2] Organizations which have ceased operations are included and noted as defunct. [S3] Notable companies\nStatus: P=Private, S=State; A=Active, D=Defunct\n| Name | Industry | Sector | Headquarters | Founded | Notes | Status | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| | |\n| Abrakebabra | Consumer services | Food Retailers & Wholesalers | Dublin | 1982 | Fast-food, part of Abrakebabra Investments | P | A |\n| ... (rest of the table) ...\n\nSo [S3] is \"Notable companies\" followed by the status definitions and the table. But the actual data in the table isn't numbered. Therefore, perhaps the answer can't be cited? But the user expects citations. Alternatively, maybe the entire table is considered as part of [S3], but that's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the formatting, and the table entries are part of the sentences. But given the way it's presented, the sentences are [S1], [S2], [S3], and then the table. So the notes in the table are not part of the numbered sentences. Therefore, there's no citation. But that can't be right. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says that the supporting context is provided, and the answer must cite the sentence numbers. So if the answer is in the table, but the table isn't part of the numbered sentences, then there's no citation. However, maybe the user intended that the table entries are part of the sentences. For example, maybe each row in the table is considered a sentence. But the problem is that the user hasn't labeled them. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considers the entire table as part of [S3], but that's not clear. Given the ambiguity, but needing to provide a citation, perhaps the answer is in the table, and the citation is [S3], but that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the table entries are part of the sentences. For example, the note for First Trust Bank is in the table, and since the table is under [S3], maybe the citation is [S3]. But this is uncertain. \n\nHowever, given the information, the correct answer is First Trust Bank, and the note is in the table. Since the table is part of the supporting context, and the user's instructions require citations, but the table isn't numbered, perhaps the answer is given without a citation. But the user's example shows that even if there's no citation, the cite tag is left empty. \n\nWait, the user's example shows that if a sentence doesn't have a citation, the cite tag is empty. So if the answer is based on the table, which isn't part of the numbered sentences, then there's no citation. But the user's example has sentences with and without citations. \n\nBut in this case, the answer is in the table, which isn't part of the numbered sentences. Therefore, the answer would have no citation. However, the user might expect that the table is part of the context, and the answer is derived from it, but without a specific sentence number. \n\nBut according to the problem's instructions, the answer must cite the sentence numbers. Therefore, perhaps the answer is not possible, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the user considers the entire table as part of [S3], so the citation is [S3]. \n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with that assumption. So the answer is First Trust Bank, and the citation is [S3]."
