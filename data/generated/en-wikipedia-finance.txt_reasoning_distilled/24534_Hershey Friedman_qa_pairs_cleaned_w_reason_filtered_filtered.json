He's a Canadian billionaire with businesses in plastics packaging, kosher meat, real estate, and Jewish books. His early life in Montreal, family background, education.

Also, mention his personal details briefly, like his family and residence.\n\nNeed to make sure each sentence covers a different aspect. Maybe start with his role as a billionaire businessman and philanthropist. Then his business areas, then his philanthropy, and a sentence on personal life. Check for key numbers like the $20 million Talmud project and the real estate aid in 2023. Avoid minor details like the specific schools he attended unless necessary. Keep it concise.\n</think>\n\nHershey Friedman is a Canadian billionaire businessman and philanthropist known for his ventures in plastics packaging, kosher meat, luxury real estate, and Jewish book publishing. He expanded his family's textile business into a major plastics packaging company, supplying brands like Hershey’s and Pepsi, and acquired Agri Star Meat, a kosher meat producer, while developing luxury real estate in Israel. A significant philanthropist, he funds large-scale projects like the \"Friedman edition\" of Jewish texts, including the Babylonian Talmud, and provided humanitarian aid during the 2023 Israel conflict. Friedman also maintains a dual residence in Montreal and Israel, with family members involved in his business operations.",

Then there's a section titled \"Early life\" with [S4] stating \"Hershey Friedman was born in 1950 in Montreal, Quebec.\" That seems to directly answer the question. The other sentences mention his parents, his father's accident, and his education, but the birth year is specifically mentioned in [S4]. The citation here would be [S4]. I should check if there's any other mention of his birth date elsewhere. Scanning through the rest, [S2] mentions he was born in 1950, but wait, no, [S2] says \"Hershey Friedman (born 1950)\" so that's another citation. Wait, the user's context has [S2] as part of the first paragraph.

The first line after the chunk is [S1] Hershey Friedman, then the next line is # Hershey Friedman, then the text starts with \"Hershey Friedman (born 1950) is a Canadian...\" which is [S2]. Then in the \"Early life\" section, [S4] says he was born in 1950. So both [S2] and [S4] mention 1950. But the question is when he was born, so the answer is 1950. The citations would be [S2] and [S4]. Wait, but the user's instruction says to cite the sentence numbers. So the answer should be 1950, with citations [S2] and [S4]. But let me make sure. The first mention is in [S2], which is part of the initial paragraph, and then [S4] in the early life section. Both are correct. So the statement would be \"Hershey Friedman was born in 1950.\" with citations [S2][S4]. But the user's example shows that each sentence is in <statement> tags. So the answer should be a statement with the birth year and the citations. So the correct answer is 1950, citing [S2] and [S4]."

[S11] ## Career\n\nFriedman started his career by working for his family textile company. [S12] By 1982, he acquired a plastics packaging business. [S13] By 2014, Friedman told *The Jerusalem Post*, \"we are the largest in North America, packaging Hershey’s chocolates, Pepsi, Nestle, Elle Candy, the famous Entenmann’s donuts, McCain’s fries, as well as larger and smaller companies internationally and locally.

      "answer": "<statement>Hershey Friedman is a co-owner of Dun & Bradstreet, Fourier, and CVD.<cite>[S18]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking which companies Hershey Friedman is a co-owner of. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find that information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for any mentions of companies he co-owns. The user mentioned that the answer should include citations from the sentences. Let me go through each section.\n\nIn the \"Career\" section, there's a part that says: \"Friedman is the co-owner of 'Dun & Bradstreet, Fourier, which produces solutions for scientific education, and CVD, a development company.'\" That seems to directly answer the question. The sentence is [S18], I think. Wait, let me check the numbers. The sentence starts with \"Friedman is the co-owner...\" and the citation after that is [S18]? Wait, looking back at the context:\n\nThe sentence is: \"Friedman is the co-owner of \"Dun & Bradstreet, Fourier, which produces solutions for scientific education, and CVD, a development company.\" [S18]\"\n\nWait, no, the numbering might be different. Let me check again. The context has [S1] to [S30]. The sentence about co-owning the companies is in the Career section. Let me find the exact line.\n\nLooking at the text:\n\n\"Friedman is the co-owner of \"Dun & Bradstreet, Fourier, which produces solutions for scientific education, and CVD, a development company.\" [S18]\"\n\nWait, the line before that is [S17] about purchasing Agriprocessors, then [S18] is the sentence about co-owning those companies. So the citation here would be [S18]. \n\nAre there any other mentions? Let me check the rest. The rest of the context talks about his philanthropy, early life, etc. No other companies are mentioned as co-owned. So the answer should list Dun & Bradstreet, Fourier, and CVD. The citation is [S18]. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other information. The user might have other sentences, but in the given context, that's the only one. So the answer is those three companies with the citation [S18]."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the types of organizations that Hershey Friedman contributes to through philanthropy. I need to look through the provided supporting context and find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for sections related to philanthropy. There's a section titled \"Philanthropy\" which starts at [S21]. Let me check that. \n\nIn [S21], it says he contributes to charities, hospitals, and yeshivas. That's a start. Then, [S22] mentions he invests in publishing holy seforim and is the chief patron of several Jewish texts published by the Oz Vehadar institute. The \"Friedman edition\" is mentioned in [S23]. \n\nAlso, [S25] talks about providing apartments to evacuees through his real estate company Azorim, and [S26] mentions kosher food shipments to soldiers. These seem like humanitarian aid and Jewish communal support. [S27] summarizes his commitment to humanitarian aid and Jewish communal support.\n\nSo, the organizations would include charities, hospitals, yeshivas, and possibly the Oz Vehadar institute for publishing religious texts. The real estate company Azorim is part of his business, but the philanthropy here is through his company's actions. However, the question is about the types of organizations, not necessarily the businesses themselves. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not including his businesses unless they are charitable. The passage says he contributes to charities, hospitals, yeshivas, and supports the publication of religious texts. The evacuee apartments and food shipments are part of his philanthropy, but the organizations here might be the ones receiving the aid, like shelters or military organizations, but the text doesn't specify particular organizations, just the types (humanitarian aid and Jewish communal support). \n\nSo the answer should list charities, hospitals, yeshivas, and organizations involved in publishing holy books. The citations would be [S21], [S22], [S23], [S25], [S26], [S27]. Wait, but [S25] and [S26] are specific examples, but the question is about types. Maybe the main ones are [S21] and [S22]. However, the user might want all relevant citations. Let me check again.\n\nThe exact sentences: \n\n[S21] \"charities, hospitals and yeshivas\"\n\n[S22] \"publishing holy seforim\" and \"Oz Vehadar institute\"\n\n[S25] \"evacuees of the conflict in southern Israel\"\n\n[S26] \"soldiers on the front lines\"\n\n[S27] \"humanitarian aid and Jewish communal support\"\n\nSo the types are charities, hospitals, yeshivas, organizations related to publishing holy books (like Oz Vehadar), and those involved in humanitarian aid and Jewish communal support. But the question is about the types of organizations. So the answer would include those categories. \n\nI need to structure the answer with each statement and citations. For example, the first statement could be about charities, hospitals, yeshivas (citing [S21]), then the publishing of seforim and Oz Vehadar (citing [S22] and [S23]), and then the humanitarian aid and Jewish communal support (citing [S27]). The specific examples in [S25] and [S26] might be part of the humanitarian aid category. \n\nSo the final answer would have multiple statements with appropriate citations."
