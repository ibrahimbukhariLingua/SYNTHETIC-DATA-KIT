      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking about Oleksandr Romanyuk's role at Ukrgasvydobuvannya JSC until January 2023. I need to look through the supporting context provided.\n\nLooking at the sentences, [S1] mentions he's a Ukrainian top manager and acting general director of Ukrgasvydobuvannya JSC until January 2023. Then [S4] says he held the position of acting general director since May 2022. Also, [S19] states he was appointed acting general director in May 2022, and [S20] mentions he left the company in January 2023. So putting that together, his role was acting general director until January 2023. The other sentences mention his previous roles, like First Deputy Chairman from June 2015 [S2] and [S15], but the question is specifically about until January 2023. So the key sentences are [S1], [S4], [S19], and [S20]. But the answer should be based on the direct statements. The first sentence [S1] directly states he was the acting general director until January 2023. So the answer is acting general director, cited from [S1]. Also, [S4] and [S19] support that he was acting general director starting May 2022, but the question is about until January 2023, so [S1] is the main citation. However, [S20] says he left in January 2023, which confirms the end date. But the question is about his role, not the end date. So the answer is acting general director, cited from [S1]. Maybe also [S4] and [S19] but the user might need only the direct answer. Let me check the exact wording. The question is \"role at Ukrgasvydobuvannya JSC until January 2023\". The answer is \"acting general director\", and the citation is [S1]. The other sentences support the timeline but the direct answer is in [S1]."

The answer would be that he was the director (or head) of the Exploration and Production Division. Since the question asks for the position, both [S3] and [S16] are citations. However, the user might need to include all relevant citations. But the answer should be accurate. The exact wording in the answer would be \"director for Exploration and production division\" from [S3] and \"head of Exploration and Production Division\" from [S16]. But maybe they are the same position. So the answer would cite both [S3] and [S16]. \n\nI need to make sure that the answer is based on the given sentences.

So the correct statement would be: \"Oleksandr Romanyuk's position at NJSC Naftogaz of Ukraine since May 2020 was director for Exploration and production division.\" with citations [S3] and [S16]. Alternatively, since [S16] uses \"head\" instead of \"director\", but it's the same division. The answer should reflect the exact terms used in the context.

The key phrase here is \"more than twenty years.\" So the answer would be that he has over 20 years of experience. \n\nI should check if there are other sentences that mention his experience. Let me quickly scan through the rest. [S1] is just his name. [S2] talks about his appointment in 2015. [S3] mentions his role since 2020. [S4] 2022. [S6] is about his biography. [S7]-[S23] cover his education and other positions, but none of them mention the exact number of years. \n\nSo the only direct mention is [S5]. Therefore, the answer should be based on that sentence.

However, the question is about his position from 2001 to 2005. Then, in [S12], it says he worked at Coopers & Lybrand/PwC from 1997 to 2000. Then, [S13] states: \"From 2001 to 2005 he was a Senior Consultant, Project Manager of the international consulting company McKinsey & Company; from 2005 to 2009 was the investment projects manager for industrial assets acquisition, mineral deposits and real estate development.\" \n\nSo, [S13] directly answers the question. The position was Senior Consultant and Project Manager. The citation here is [S13]. I need to make sure there are no other sentences that mention his role at McKinsey. Let me check again. \n\nOther sentences: [S8] is about the Mini MBA, not the position. [S12] is about PwC. [S13] is the only one mentioning McKinsey & Company's position during the specified years. So the answer should be Senior Consultant, Project Manager with citation [S13]."

      "answer": "<statement>Oleksandr Romanyuk founded Ukrainian Energy LLC in September 2023.<cite>[S22]</cite></statement>",

The user mentioned that the answer should be cited with sentence numbers. Let me go through each sentence.\n\nLooking at the chunks, there's a section that says: \"In September 2023, Romanyuk opened his own company, Ukrainian Energy LLC, where he holds the position of CEO.\" That's sentence [S22]. \n\nWait, the question is about the company he founded. The sentence says he opened his own company, which is Ukrainian Energy LLC. There's no other mention of a company founded in September 2023. The other sentences talk about his roles in other companies like Ukrgasvydobuvannya JSC, Naftogaz, and his work with PwC and McKinsey, but those are not founded by him. \n\nSo the answer should be Ukrainian Energy LLC, cited from [S22]. I don't see any other sentences that mention a company founded in that time. The other sentences either talk about his previous roles or other events. So the correct answer is Ukrainian Energy LLC with the citation [S22]."
