      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking where BB Biotech AG is based and what its primary investment focus is. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. Let me scan the text for relevant information. \n\nStarting with the first sentence, [S1] mentions \"BB Biotech\" and the next sentence [S2] says it's a Swiss investment company. So the base is Switzerland. Then, [S2] also mentions they invest mainly in the US and Western Europe. \n\nLooking for the primary investment focus, [S9] talks about being a closed-end fund investing in biotech companies. [S10] specifies small-to-mid-cap biotech companies in Western Europe and the US. Also, [S11] lists areas like oncology, neurological disorders, etc. But the question asks for the primary focus, which is likely the regions and the type of companies. \n\nI need to make sure I cite the correct sentences. The base is Switzerland, cited from [S1] and [S2]. The investment focus is in US and Western Europe, from [S2] and [S10]. Also, [S9] mentions the biotech sector. \n\nWait, the user might want the primary focus as the regions and the type of companies. So combining [S2], [S9], [S10]. But the exact answer should be based on the sentences. Let me check again.\n\nThe first part of the answer: \"BB Biotech AG is based in Switzerland.\" Citations would be [S1] and [S2], but [S1] just mentions the name. Maybe [S2] says it's a Swiss company. Then the investment focus is mainly in the US and Western Europe, from [S2], and [S10] adds the specific regions. \n\nSo the answer would be: Based in Switzerland, primary focus on small-to-mid-cap biotech companies in the US and Western Europe. Citations [S2], [S10]. Also, [S9] mentions the biotech sector. But the question is about where it's based and the focus. So the answer should have the location from [S2] and the focus from [S2] and [S10]. \n\nI need to structure the statements properly with citations. Let me make sure each sentence is correctly cited."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking on which stock exchanges BB Biotech's shares are traded. I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the relevant sentences.\n\nLooking at the chunk given, there's a section titled \"History\" which mentions several exchanges. Let me go through each sentence under that section. \n\nSentence S5 talks about the company's shares being traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange since December 27, 1993. Then, S6 mentions the German Deutsche B\u00f6rse in Frankfurt since December 10, 1997. There's also S7 which mentions the TecDAX, but I think TecDAX is a part of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse, so maybe that's included in S6. Then S8 says the shares were listed on the Italian Nuovo Mercato from October 19, 2000, to September 4, 2023, and since September 2005 in the Star segment. \n\nWait, the question is about current exchanges. The Italian Nuovo Mercato listing ended on September 4, 2023, so that might not be active anymore. But the Star segment under the Italian exchange is mentioned as being since September 2005. However, the exact current status isn't clear. The main ones mentioned are SIX Swiss Exchange and Deutsche B\u00f6rse. The TecDAX is a sub-index of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse, so maybe that's part of the same exchange. The Italian Nuovo Mercato is a different exchange, but the date given is up to 2023. The user might want all exchanges where the shares are traded, even if some are historical. But the question is phrased as \"are traded,\" which could imply current. However, the context doesn't specify if the Italian listing is still active. \n\nSo the answer should include the SIX Swiss Exchange, Deutsche B\u00f6rse, and possibly the Italian Nuovo Mercato. But since the Italian listing ended in 2023, maybe it's not current. However, the context doesn't explicitly say it's no longer listed. The sentence says \"since September 2005 in the Star segment (TechStar).\" So maybe the Star segment is still active. But the Nuovo Mercato part ended in 2023. \n\nThe user might need all the exchanges mentioned. So the answer would be SIX Swiss Exchange, Deutsche B\u00f6rse, and the Italian Nuovo Mercato (but note the end date). However, the question might just want the current ones. But since the context doesn't clarify, I should list all the exchanges mentioned in the context. \n\nSo the sentences to cite are S5, S6, S7, and S8. Wait, S7 mentions TecDAX, which is part of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse. So maybe S6 and S7 are both about Deutsche B\u00f6rse. Then S8 is about the Italian exchanges. So the answer would be SIX Swiss Exchange, Deutsche B\u00f6rse, and the Italian Nuovo Mercato. But the exact citations would be S5, S6, S8. S7 might not be a separate exchange but a sub-index. \n\nI need to check the exact wording. S5: SIX Swiss Exchange. S6: Deutsche B\u00f6rse in Frankfurt. S7: TecDAX (which is a part of Deutsche B\u00f6rse). S8: Italian Nuovo Mercato and Star segment. So the exchanges are SIX Swiss Exchange, Deutsche B\u00f6rse (including TecDAX), and the Italian exchanges (Nuovo Mercato and Star). But the question is about stock exchanges, so TecDAX is a stock index, not an exchange. So maybe only the exchanges are SIX, Deutsche B\u00f6rse, and the Italian exchanges. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be the SIX Swiss Exchange, the German Deutsche B\u00f6rse, and the Italian exchanges (Nuovo Mercato and Star). But the exact citations are S5, S6, S8. The TecDAX part (S7) might not be an exchange. So the answer should list the exchanges mentioned in S5, S6, and S8. So the citations would be [S5][S6][S8]."

Scanning through the rest of the context, the other sentences talk about listings on other exchanges like the Italian Nuovo Mercato and Deutsche B\u00f6rse, but not TecDAX. \n\nSo the answer should be the two periods mentioned in S7: 2003 to June 2012, and September 2012 to June 2015. The citation is [S7]."

Let me go through each section.\n\nLooking at the \"Investment activities\" section, there's a subsection called \"Companies and core investments.\" In that part, sentence S18 says: \"In addition, up to 10% may be held in non-listed companies (Private equity).\" That seems like a direct mention of investing in non-listed companies, which are private equity.

The other part about private equity (S18) is also about indirect investment, but the main point here is the subsidiaries. The question is specifically about how they invest indirectly, and S24 explains that they use subsidiaries. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other sentences. Let me check again.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking which Swiss stock exchange Bellevue Group is listed on. Let me look through the supporting context provided.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of Bellevue Group and stock exchanges. The user mentioned that each sentence is tagged with [S1], [S2], etc., so I need to check each sentence for these keywords.\n\nLooking at the sentences:\n\n[S2] mentions that Bellevue Asset Management is a division of Bellevue Group and is listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange. Wait, but the question is about Bellevue Group itself. However, the sentence says \"Bellevue Asset Management, a division of Bellevue Group, which is listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange.\" So does that mean the division is listed, or the parent company? The wording is a bit ambiguous. But the way it's phrased, \"Bellevue Asset Management... which is listed...\" might mean that the division is listed. But maybe the parent company is also listed. However, the question is about Bellevue Group. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another sentence. Let me check others. [S1] is BB Biotech, [S3] talks about BB Biotech being one of the largest. [S5] mentions the company's shares traded on SIX Swiss Exchange. But that's BB Biotech, not Bellevue Group. \n\nLooking further, [S22] mentions Bellevue Asset Management AG, part of the Swiss Bellevue Group, based in K\u00fcsnacht ZH. But does it say they're listed? The original [S2] says \"Bellevue Asset Management, a division of Bellevue Group, which is listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange.\" So the \"which\" refers to Bellevue Group? Or the division? The sentence structure is a bit unclear. If the division is listed, then the answer would be Swiss Stock Exchange. But if the parent company is listed, maybe the same. However, the question is about Bellevue Group. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is SIX Swiss Exchange. Because in [S5], BB Biotech's shares are traded on SIX Swiss Exchange. But that's BB Biotech, not Bellevue Group. \n\nWait, the user is asking about Bellevue Group. The only mention of Bellevue Group is in [S2] and [S22]. [S2] says \"Bellevue Asset Management, a division of Bellevue Group, which is listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange.\" So the \"which\" here refers to the division, Bellevue Asset Management. So the division is listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange. But the question is about the parent company, Bellevue Group. However, maybe the parent company is also listed. But the passage doesn't explicitly state that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Swiss Stock Exchange is the same as SIX Swiss Exchange. Sometimes \"Swiss Stock Exchange\" refers to SIX. So if the division is listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange, then the answer is Swiss Stock Exchange. But the user might be looking for SIX Swiss Exchange. However, the passage uses \"Swiss Stock Exchange\" in [S2], while [S5] mentions \"SIX Swiss Exchange\". \n\nSo the answer would be the Swiss Stock Exchange, citing [S2]. But I need to check if there's any other sentence. Let me check again. \n\nNo other sentences mention Bellevue Group's listing. So based on the given context, the answer is Swiss Stock Exchange, cited from [S2]. But I need to make sure that the sentence is correctly cited. The sentence in [S2] says \"Bellevue Asset Management, a division of Bellevue Group, which is listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange.\" So the \"which\" refers to the division, but maybe the parent company is also listed. However, the text doesn't explicitly say that. So the safest answer is that Bellevue Asset Management is listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange, but the question is about Bellevue Group. \n\nWait, maybe the user is conflating the two. If the division is part of the group, maybe the group is listed. But the sentence structure is ambiguous. However, since the question is about the group, and the passage only mentions the division being listed, perhaps the answer is that the division is listed, but the group itself isn't explicitly mentioned. However, the user might expect the answer based on the given info. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is SIX Swiss Exchange, but that's mentioned in [S5] for BB Biotech. But the question is about Bellevue Group. \n\nHmm. Given the information, the only direct mention is [S2], so I'll go with that. The answer is the Swiss Stock Exchange, cited from [S2]."
