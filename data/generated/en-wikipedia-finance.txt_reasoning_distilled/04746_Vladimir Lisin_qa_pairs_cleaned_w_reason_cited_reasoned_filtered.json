  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Vladimir Lisin in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nFirst, the document introduces Lisin as a Russian billionaire and chairman of NLMK, one of Russia's largest steel companies. It mentions his net worth and rankings. Then there's his background, starting from a coalmine job to rising through the ranks in the steel industry. He joined a group that took over the steel and aluminum industry, and later became the sole owner of Novolipetsk Steel. His business interests extend beyond steel into transportation, energy, and utilities, managed through the Fletcher Group. He also has a strong educational background in metallurgy and economics, with several degrees and patents. \n\nThen there's his involvement in sports, particularly shooting, where he held leadership roles in various organizations. He was sanctioned by Australia due to the Ukraine invasion but resisted stepping down. His personal life includes a castle in Scotland and family. The document also notes his statements about peace and the controversy around NLMK's potential military supply, though the company denied it. \n\nThe key points are his role as a major steel tycoon, his business empire, educational background, sports involvement, and the controversies related to sanctions and military supply. I need to condense this into concise sentences, making sure to highlight the main topics: his business, net worth, background, other ventures, education, sports, and the controversies. Avoid minor details like specific dates unless crucial. Check for the most important aspects and ensure clarity and conciseness.\n</think>\n\nVladimir Lisin is a Russian billionaire and chairman of NLMK, one of Russia's largest steel companies, with a net worth of $30 billion as of 2025. He built his business empire through strategic acquisitions in the steel and metallurgy sectors, expanding into transportation, energy, and utilities via the Fletcher Group, while maintaining a strong educational background in metallurgical engineering and economics. A prominent figure in sports, he led international shooting organizations and owned a major shooting complex, though he faced sanctions over his ties to Russia's military activities amid the Ukraine conflict. Despite denials, allegations of NLMK supplying materials for military use and evading sanctions sparked controversy, reflecting his complex role in both business and geopolitics.",

[S2] He is the chairman and majority shareholder of Novolipetsk (NLMK), one of the four largest steel companies in Russia. [S3] According to *Bloomberg Billionaires Index* and *Forbes*, in 2025 he is the second richest man in Russia; behind Alexey Mordashov and 64th richest in the world with an estimated net worth of US$30.0 billion. [S4] In 2022 Forbes rating, Lisin dropped to third place among Russian billionaires, behind Andrey Melnichenko and Vladimir Potanin, his fortune estimated at $22.1 billion. [S5] ## Background\n\nVladimir Lisin got his first job in 1975 working as an electrical fitter in a Soviet coalmine, and later worked as a welder foreman at Tulachermet Metals Works. [S6] He rose through the ranks to become section manager, shop manager in 1979 and deputy chief engineer in 1986. [S7] In 1992 he joined a group of traders (the Trans-World Group) who won control of Russia's steel and aluminium industry. [S8] When the partners split in 2000, he received 13% of the firm and later achieved a controlling share. [S9] His former boss was named the Minister for Russian Metallurgy, and Lisin became the sole owner of Novolipetsk Steel in 2000. [S10] Since 1993 he has been a board member of several Russian metal producers, including NLMK, MMK and Sayansk and Novokuznetsk Aluminium Plants and has been a member of the board of directors of Novolipetsk Steel (NLMK) since 1996 and its chairman since 1998. [S11] He previously worked as deputy chief engineer and as deputy general director of the Karaganda Steel Plant, one of Kazakhstan's four largest steel plants. [S12] Lisin was member of the board of directors of Zenit Bank. [S13] Lisin sits on the board of directors of the Novolipetskii Metallurgical Combine, one of largest steel companies in Russia, in 1998 and still holds that position. [S14] He is a director at CJSC Chernomorneftegaz. [S15] He was a Director of Norilsk Nickel Mining and Metallurgical Co. [S16] since 2002. [S17] He has been chairman of JSC Novolipetsk Iron & Steel Corporation (OJSC Novolipetsk Steel) since June 2007. [S18] He served as an independent member of the board of directors of OJSC United Shipbuilding Corporation in 2008\u20132012. [S19] Until January 2023 he was a member of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs bureau, but then left the post of his own free will. [S20] His business interests, apart from steel, include transportation and logistics (with stakes in St Petersburg Sea Port, Tuapse Commercial Sea Port, North-Western Shipping Company, Volga Shipping Company), energy (stakes in Chernomorneftegaz and Severneftegaz), and utilities (Russian grid companies Federal Grid Company and Distribution Grid Company of Center). [S21] These predominantly Russian assets are controlled via Fletcher Group Holdings. [S22] In the summer of 2023, it became known that Lisin registered Serenity II Holdings and Nebula II Holdings in Abu Dhabi and transferred his assets there.

The other sentences either talk about different years or other details. For example, [S4] mentions 2022 with $22.1 billion, but the question is about 2025. So the correct citation here is [S3]. I should make sure there's no other mention of 2025 elsewhere. Scanning through the rest, I don't see any other references. So the answer should be $30.0 billion with the citation [S3]."

But the question is about the company that controls the Russian assets, not where they were transferred. So [S1] seems to be the key here. \n\nThe other sentences mention Lisin's education, sports involvement, personal life, etc., which don't relate to the controlling company.

But Abu Dhabi is a city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). However, the context might not have the country mentioned. Let me check the other sentences again. The rest of the context talks about his education, sports, personal life, etc., but nothing else about the registration. So the answer is Abu Dhabi, UAE. But the supporting context only mentions Abu Dhabi in [S2], so the citation is [S2]. The country isn't specified in the context, but since the question asks for the city and country, I need to infer the country based on common knowledge. However, the instructions say to use the supporting context. Since the context doesn't mention the country, maybe just the city? Wait, the question says \"city and country,\" but the context only provides the city. Hmm. But the user might expect the country as well. But according to the rules, I can only cite the sentences provided. Since [S2] mentions Abu Dhabi but not the country, maybe the answer is Abu Dhabi, and the country isn't in the context. But the user might expect UAE. However, I have to stick strictly to the given text. So the answer is Abu Dhabi, and the citation is [S2]. The country isn't mentioned, so perhaps the answer is just the city. But the question asks for both. Maybe the answer is Abu Dhabi, UAE, but since the context doesn't mention UAE, I can't cite it. Wait, but the user might expect that Abu Dhabi is in the UAE. However, the instructions say to use the supporting context. Since the context doesn't state the country, maybe I should only mention the city. But the question requires both. This is a bit tricky. However, the supporting context only mentions Abu Dhabi, so I'll go with that and cite [S2]. The country might be implied, but without a citation, I can't include it. So the answer is Abu Dhabi, with [S2]."

I need to look through the supporting context provided.\n\nLooking at the chunks, there's a section labeled \"Education and metallurgical expertise\". Let's check the sentences there. \n\nSentence S3 mentions he graduated from the Siberian Metallurgic Institute in 1979 with a metallurgical engineering diploma. Then S4 says he completed postgraduate study in 1984 from UKRNIIMET in Kharkov, Ukraine. Then S5 states he graduated with an MSc in metal engineering from the Central Research Institute of ferrous metallurgy named after I. P. Bardin (Moscow) in 1989. \n\nSo the answer should be the Central Research Institute of ferrous metallurgy named after I. P. Bardin. The citation here is S5. Let me check if there are any other sentences that might mention this. S6 and S7 are part of the same sentence, but S6 is just \"P.\" and S7 is \"Bardin (Moscow).\" So the full name is in S5. \n\nNo other sentences mention the MSc in 1989. The other degrees are from different years and institutions. So the correct answer is the Central Research Institute of ferrous metallurgy named after I. P. Bardin, cited as S5."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking who supported Lisin's refusal to step down as president and what the ISSF Secretary General claimed.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context. The passage is split into several sentences with labels from [S1] to [S11]. \n\nStarting with the first sentence, [S1] says: \"He resisted calls to step down as president, supported by the Russian-born ISSF Secretary General Alexander Ratner \u2013 who claimed that neither had any links to the Russian government.\" This seems directly relevant. The \"he\" here refers to Lisin, I assume. So, Alexander Ratner, the ISSF Secretary General, supported Lisin's refusal. The claim made by Ratner is that neither Lisin nor he (Ratner?) had links to the Russian government. \n\nWait, the sentence structure is a bit ambiguous. The dash after \"Alexander Ratner\" explains that he claimed neither had links. So \"neither\" would refer to Lisin and Ratner? Or maybe Lisin and someone else? But the context is about Lisin's refusal. So probably, Ratner claimed that Lisin and himself (Ratner) had no links to the Russian government. \n\nThe question also asks what the ISSF Secretary General claimed. So the answer here is that he claimed there were no links to the Russian government. \n\nLooking through the other sentences, [S3] to [S11] talk about other things like Aberuchill Castle, letters from Lisin, sanctions, NLMK's responses, etc. None of these seem to mention who else supported Lisin's refusal. The first sentence is the key here. \n\nSo the answer should be that Alexander Ratner, the ISSF Secretary General, supported Lisin's refusal and claimed there were no links to the Russian government. The citation would be [S1]. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other information elsewhere. For example, [S8] is part of NLMK's response, but that's about their operations. The question is specifically about who supported Lisin's refusal. So only [S1] is relevant here. \n\nTherefore, the statement should be: \"Alexander Ratner, the Russian-born ISSF Secretary General, supported Lisin's refusal to step down as president, and he claimed that neither Lisin nor himself had any links to the Russian government.\" The citation is [S1]. \n\nWait, the original sentence in [S1] says \"neither had any links to the Russian government.\" The \"neither\" refers to \"Lisin\" and \"the Russian-born ISSF Secretary General Alexander Ratner.\" So the claim is that both Lisin and Ratner had no links. So the answer should reflect that. \n\nSo the answer is: Lisin's refusal was supported by Alexander Ratner, the ISSF Secretary General, who claimed that neither Lisin nor he (Ratner) had links to the Russian government. \n\nYes, that's accurate based on [S1]. No other citations are needed here. The rest of the context doesn't mention other supporters or the ISSF Secretary General's claims regarding this specific issue."

I need to look through the supporting context provided.\n\nLooking at the chunks, [S4] mentions that in March 2022, Lisin called for a peaceful resolution in a letter to staff at NLMK. The quote there is about lost lives being a tragedy and preferring peaceful diplomatic conflict resolution over force. The other sentences mention later events in September and October 2022, like sanctions and NLMK's response, but those are after the letter. The key part is [S4] where he called for peaceful resolution. The citations here would be [S4], but I should check if there's more. The quote in [S4] is part of the letter, so that's the main point. The answer is that he advocated for a peaceful resolution and diplomatic conflict resolution instead of force. The citation is [S4]."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the allegations made against NLMK and Lisin in 2022. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan each sentence. Sentence S5 mentions that in September 2022, it was claimed NLMK supplied materials to Russian firms involved in nuclear weapon development. That's one allegation. Then, also in S5, it says tankers owned by Lisin participated in evading EU sanctions by trans-shipping oil at sea to EU-registered vessels. So that's another allegation against Lisin.\n\nLooking at other sentences, S6 mentions the US urging sanctions against Lisin, but that's a response rather than an allegation. The responses from NLMK are in S7-S10, but those are their denials, not the allegations themselves. The rest of the sentences talk about personal life, purchases, etc., which aren't relevant here.\n\nSo the main allegations are in S5. I need to make sure there are no other sentences. Let me check again. S5 is the only one mentioning the specific allegations. The answer should include both points from S5. The citations would be [S5]. Wait, but the user might think if there's more. But according to the context given, only S5 has those allegations. The other sentences either talk about responses or other details. So the answer should cite S5 for both allegations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking about NLMK's response to allegations regarding their steel production. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through each sentence. Sentence S1 talks about someone resisting calls to step down, but it's about the ISSF Secretary General, not NLMK. S2 is about personal life, so not relevant. S3 mentions Lisin buying a castle, not related. S4 is a letter from Lisin to NLMK staff about peaceful resolution. S5 mentions the content of that letter, but it's more about the conflict in general. \n\nThen S6 says the US was urged to sanction Lisin. S7 is where the response comes in. The sentence starts with \"Lisin and NLMK responded...\" and includes quotes from The Times, RFE/RL, etc. The quotes state that NLMK's Russian operations aren't capable of producing military steel, they focus on civilian use, and they haven't supplied military products. Also, they can't control end uses. \n\nSo the response is in S7. The citations here would be S7, but the quotes are part of that sentence. Wait, the user wants citations for each sentence. The answer should be the statements from S7. Let me check again. The actual response is in S7, which includes the quotes. So the answer would be the content of S7, cited as [S7]. Also, S8, S9, S10 are part of the same statement? Wait, looking at the structure:\n\n[S7] Lisin and NLMK responded, as was cited by The Times, RFE/RL and other outlets, with the following: *\"The Russian operations of NLMK are not capable of producing steel intended for military applications. [S8] Our operations focus solely on producing rolled strip steel intended for general civilian use. [S9] NLMK has never supplied military intended products to the Russian military-industrial complex. [S10] That said, NLMK cannot control end uses of its civilian products\"*. \n\nSo the entire response is in S7, but the sentences S8, S9, S10 are part of the same statement? Wait, no. The way the chunk is structured, each sentence is numbered. So S7 is the sentence where the response is mentioned, and then the quotes are part of that same sentence? Or are S8, S9, S10 separate sentences? The way it's written, the quotes are within the same sentence as S7. But in the original chunk, the structure is:\n\n[S7] ... with the following: *\"The Russian operations... [S8] Our operations... [S9] NLMK has... [S10] That said... \"*\n\nSo it seems like the quotes are part of S7's content. Therefore, the response is in S7, and the citations for the specific points would be S7, S8, S9, S10. But the user's question is about NLMK's response. So the answer would be the statements from S7, which includes the quotes. However, each sentence in the response would need their own citations. But according to the structure, the quotes are part of S7. Wait, maybe the user's context is structured such that each [S1], [S2], etc., are separate sentences. So S7 is one sentence, and then the quotes inside it are part of that same sentence. But in the actual text, the quotes are separate sentences? Or are they part of the same sentence?\n\nLooking at the original chunk:\n\n[S7] Lisin and NLMK responded, as was cited by The Times, RFE/RL and other outlets, with the following: *\"The Russian operations of NLMK are not capable of producing steel intended for military applications. [S8] Our operations focus solely on producing rolled strip steel intended for general civilian use. [S9] NLMK has never supplied military intended products to the Russian military-industrial complex. [S10] That said, NLMK cannot control end uses of its civilian products\"*. \n\nIt seems like the quotes are part of the same sentence as S7. But the way it's written, each of the quotes (S8, S9, S10) are separate sentences. However, in the original chunk, they are included within the quotes of S7. So perhaps the actual sentences are S7, S8, S9, S10. But the way the chunk is presented, the [S7] is the sentence that includes the quotes, and the [S8], [S9], [S10] are part of that same sentence. But that's not possible because each [S] is a separate sentence. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that S7 is the sentence where NLMK's response is mentioned, and the quotes inside are separate sentences (S8, S9, S10). But the user's context might have them as separate sentences. \n\nSo the answer would be the statements from S7, S8, S9, S10. But the question is asking for NLMK's response. The response includes the statements in S7, S8, S9, S10. However, the user's instruction says to answer the question and provide citations of the sentence number. So each sentence in the answer should have its citations. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be:\n\n<statement>NLMK stated that their Russian operations are not capable of producing steel for military applications.</statement><cite>[S7]</cite>\n<statement>They focus solely on producing rolled strip steel for civilian use.</statement><cite>[S8]</cite>\n<statement>NLMK has never supplied military products to the Russian military-industrial complex.</statement><cite>[S9]</cite>\n<statement>They cannot control the end uses of their civilian products.</statement><cite>[S10]</cite>\n\nBut the user might expect the entire response to be in one statement. However, according to the instructions, each sentence is in its own <statement> tag. So the answer would be multiple statements, each with their citations. However, the original response in S7 includes all those points. So the correct way is to split each part into separate statements with their respective citations. But the user's example shows that a single statement can have multiple citations. However, in this case, each part of the response is a separate sentence. \n\nAlternatively, if the entire response is considered one statement, then the citations would be [S7][S8][S9][S10], but that might not be accurate because S7 is the sentence that mentions the response, and the subsequent sentences are the actual content. But based on the structure provided, the [S7] includes the quotes, which are separate sentences. Therefore, the answer should be each of the statements from S7, S8, S9, S10. However, the user's question is about NLMK's response, which is the entire set of statements. \n\nBut according to the supporting context, the response is in S7, which includes the quotes. So the answer would be the quotes as part of S7. But the way the chunk is written, the quotes are part of S7's content. Therefore, the answer is the statements in S7, S8, S9, S10. But I need to check if those are separate sentences. \n\nIn the given chunk, each [S] is a separate sentence. So S7 is one sentence, and then S8, S9, S10 are separate sentences. Therefore, the response is spread across multiple sentences. So the answer would be each of those sentences. \n\nSo the answer would be:\n\n<statement>Lisin and NLMK responded by stating that their Russian operations are not capable of producing steel intended for military applications.</statement><cite>[S7]</cite>\n<statement>Our operations focus solely on producing rolled strip steel intended for general civilian use.</statement><cite>[S8]</cite>\n<statement>NLMK has never supplied military intended products to the Russian military-industrial complex.</statement><cite>[S9]</cite>\n<statement>NLMK cannot control end uses of its civilian products.</statement><cite>[S10]</cite>\n\nBut the user's question is about NLMK's response. So all these statements are part of the response. Therefore, each of these sentences should be included with their respective citations."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what happened to the vessels owned by Lisin in September 2022. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of Lisin's vessels and the date September 2022. Let's go through each sentence:\n\n[S1] Talks about Lisin resisting calls to step down and mentions the ISSF Secretary General. No info on vessels here.\n\n[S2] Personal life, married with children. Not relevant.\n\n[S3] Says Lisin bought a castle in 2005. Not related to vessels.\n\n[S4] March 2022 letter from Lisin about peaceful resolution. Not about vessels.\n\n[S5] Here it mentions that in September 2022, NLMK supplied materials to Russian firms involved in nuclear weapons, and tankers owned by Lisin evaded EU sanctions by trans-shipping oil. This seems relevant. So the vessels (tankers) were involved in evading sanctions.\n\n[S6] October 2022, US urged to sanction Lisin. Not directly about the vessels' fate in September.\n\n[S7] Lisin and NLMK's response about their operations. They claim they don't produce military steel. But this is a response to the accusations, not the actual event.\n\n[S8] Part of the response, explaining their focus on civilian use.\n\n[S9] Same context, denying military supply.\n\n[S10] Acknowledging they can't control end uses.\n\n[S11] Finally, this sentence says that as for vessels, the company sold them off as unprofitable in September 2022. So this is the key point. The vessels were sold off because they were unprofitable.\n\nSo the answer should combine both the evasion of sanctions and the sale of vessels. But the question is specifically about what happened to the vessels. The passage mentions both that they were used to evade sanctions and that they were sold. However, the exact event in September 2022 is the sale. The evasion might have happened around the same time but the sale is explicitly stated in [S11]. \n\nWait, the user's question is about what happened to the vessels. The answer should be that they were sold off as unprofitable in September 2022. The part about evading sanctions is in [S5], but the sale is in [S11]. So the main answer is from [S11], but [S5] also mentions the tankers' involvement. However, the question is about what happened to the vessels, so the sale is the direct answer. But maybe the user wants both points? Let me check the question again: \"What happened to the vessels owned by Lisin in September 2022?\" The answer is that they were sold off as unprofitable (S11). However, the context also mentions that in September 2022, the tankers participated in evading sanctions (S5). So both events occurred in September. But the user might be looking for the sale. However, the answer needs to be based on the context. The supporting context says in S5 that the tankers were involved in evading sanctions, and in S11 that the company sold the vessels as unprofitable. So both events happened in September. But the question is about what happened to the vessels. So the answer would include both points? Or is there a distinction between the tankers and the vessels? Wait, the question is about vessels owned by Lisin. The context says \"tankers owned by Lisin had participated in evading EU sanctions\" (S5) and \"as for vessels, the company sold them off as unprofitable in September 2022\" (S11). So the vessels were sold, and the tankers were involved in evading sanctions. But maybe the tankers are a type of vessel. So perhaps the answer is that the vessels (tankers) were involved in evading sanctions and later sold. But the exact answer depends on the context. The user's question is about what happened to the vessels. The answer would be that they were sold, but also that they were used to evade sanctions. However, the supporting context's S11 directly states that the vessels were sold. So the answer should include that. But the user might need both points. Let me check the exact wording. The question is asking for what happened to the vessels. The answer is that they were sold off as unprofitable in September 2022 (S11). However, the context also mentions that in September 2022, the tankers owned by Lisin were involved in evading sanctions (S5). So both events occurred. But the user might be looking for the sale. However, the answer should be based on the context. The answer should mention both points if they are relevant. But the user's question is about what happened to the vessels. So the answer would be that the vessels were sold, and also that they were used to evade sanctions. But the exact answer depends on the context. Let me check the original passage again. The passage says in S5: \"tankers owned by Lisin had participated in evading EU sanctions by trans-shipping oil at sea to EU-registered vessels.\" And in S11: \"the company sold them off as unprofitable in September 2022.\" So the vessels (tankers) were involved in evading sanctions and then sold. So the answer should include both. But the user might be looking for the sale. However, the question is about what happened to the vessels. So the answer is that they were sold, but also that they were used in evading sanctions. But the answer needs to be accurate. The user might need both points. However, the answer should be based on the context. So the correct answer is that the vessels were sold off as unprofitable in September 2022 (S11), and also that they were involved in evading sanctions (S5). But the question is about what happened to them. So the main event is the sale. However, the user might need both. But according to the instructions, I need to answer as accurately as possible. So the answer should include both points, citing S5 and S11. Wait, but the user's question is about what happened to the vessels. The answer would be that they were sold, but the context also mentions their involvement in evading sanctions. However, the sale is a direct event. So the answer is that the vessels were sold off as unprofitable in September 2022 (S11). But the user might also want to know about the sanctions evasion. However, the question is about what happened to the vessels, so the sale is the direct answer. But the context mentions both. So the answer should include both. Let me check the exact wording again. The question is \"What happened to the vessels owned by Lisin in September 2022?\" The answer is that they were sold (S11) and that they were used to evade sanctions (S5). So the answer should mention both. But how to structure it. The user's answer should be in the format with statements and citations. So the answer would be two statements: one about the sale (S11) and one about the sanctions evasion (S5). But the user might need to know both. However, the question is about what happened to the vessels. So the answer is that they were sold, but also that they were involved in evading sanctions. Therefore, the correct answer would have two statements: one citing S5 and S11. But the user's answer format requires each sentence to have its own citations. So the answer would be:\n\n<statement>The vessels owned by Lisin were involved in evading EU sanctions by trans-shipping oil at sea to EU-registered vessels in September 2022.<cite>[S5]</cite></statement> <statement>The company sold the vessels off as unprofitable in September 2022.<cite>[S11]</cite></statement>\n\nBut the user might need to know both events. However, the question is about what happened to the vessels. So both events are part of what happened. Therefore, the answer should include both points with their respective citations."
