  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about MSI 20000 in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document introduces MSI 20000 as an international financial standard for assessing companies' financial health. It's used in France, Switzerland, and Germany. The main purpose is to measure financial strength and performance, focusing on solvency, profitability, and sustainability. The certification is based on audits and involves ratios, financial instruments, and econometric models tailored to each sector. It was created after the 2008 crisis to help identify healthy companies and mitigate market crashes. The certification is valid for three years and requires accredited bodies. International providers like COFICERT, SGS, and Dekra offer it.\n\nNow, I need to condense this. The key points are: what MSI 20000 is, its purpose, the areas it covers (financial strength and performance), the certification process, its origin post-2008 crisis, and the international providers. I should mention the countries where it's used, the scope (solvency, profitability, sustainability), the audit process, and the validity period. Also, note the international certification bodies. Avoid too many details but include the main concepts and the history. Make sure it's concise and flows well in 3-5 sentences.\n</think>\n\nThe **MSI 20000** is an international financial standard designed to assess the financial health of organizations, focusing on solvency, profitability, and sustainability through sector-specific ratios, financial instruments, and econometric models. Developed post-2008 crisis to identify resilient companies and mitigate market risks, it emphasizes financial governance and is valid for three years via accredited audits. Primarily used in France, Switzerland, and Germany, the certification is issued by entities like COFICERT, SGS, and Dekra, aligning with ISO standards and adapting to sector-specific economic and financial metrics.",

Wait, no, the sentence starts with \"MSI 20000 is a collaborative project...\" and then the next sentence is [S16]. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the supporting context has a section titled \"Concept\" with several sentences. Let me go through them:\n\n[S16] \"MSI 20000 is a collaborative project, based on simple operating rules, combining financial and technological skills.\" \n\n[S17] \"The project was conceived by international financial experts, within the MSI Organization, a non-profit NGO based in Switzerland which manages the updating of the statement of standards and its scope of application.\"\n\nAh, here it is. Sentence [S17] states that the project was conceived by international financial experts within the MSI Organization. So the answer would be the international financial experts within the MSI Organization. But the question is asking \"who\" conceived it. The MSI Organization is mentioned as the entity, but the actual conceivers are the experts. However, the answer might need to be as per the text. The text says \"conceived by international financial experts, within the MSI Organization\". So the answer is the international financial experts, but maybe the MSI Organization is the entity. Wait, the question is about who conceived it. The sentence says the project was conceived by the experts within the MSI Organization. So the answer is the international financial experts of the MSI Organization. But the exact wording in the text is \"international financial experts, within the MSI Organization\". So the answer should be those experts. But maybe the MSI Organization is the answer? Or the experts? The question is a bit ambiguous, but according to the text, it's the experts. However, sometimes organizations are credited as the conceivers. Let me check if there's another sentence that mentions the originators.\n\nLooking through other sections, under \"History\", it says the certification was developed after the subprime crisis, but that's about when, not who. The \"Versions\" section talks about creation dates but not the people. The \"Concept\" section is the only one mentioning the conceivers. So the answer is the international financial experts within the MSI Organization. But the exact citation is [S17].

I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the sections of the passage. The \"Certification\" section seems relevant. Let me check each sentence there. \n\nLooking at sentence S27: \"According to the MSI monitoring center, financial quality assessment is based on the intrinsic values of the audited facilities, which takes place after the approval of financial statements by legal auditors.\" Hmm, that's about the assessment process, not the validity period.\n\nThen S28: \"In accordance with certification's regulations, the MSI 20000 certification is valid for three years and can only be issued by an accredited or certified organization.\" Ah, here it mentions the validity period is three years. That's the answer. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention elsewhere. The \"Versions\" section talks about when it was created but not the duration. The \"History\" section mentions the subprime crisis but again, not the validity. \n\nSo the key sentence is S28. The answer is three years, cited from S28."

I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for any sentences that mention the goal or purpose of MSI 20000. Let's go through each sentence:\n\n[S1] Just introduces MSI 20000 as an international standard measuring a company's financial situation. Not the main goal, more of a definition.\n\n[S2]-[S4] Talk about applicability, usage in certain countries, and compliance certification. Not the main goal.\n\n[S5]-[S6] Mention the scope statement's specifications focusing on financial strength and performance. Still not the main goal.\n\n[S7] Says the certification provides info on best practices and serves as an indicator of good financial governance. This is closer to a goal.\n\n[S8] Mentions serving as a benchmark for economic actors. Also a possible goal.\n\n[S9] History section starts here. [S9] talks about the certification being developed after the 2008 crisis to identify healthy companies and minimize stock market crash impacts. [S10] adds about facing market reluctance during events. This seems like a specific goal related to crisis management.\n\n[S11] Versions section, not relevant here.\n\n[S12]-[S15] History details, not the main goal.\n\n[S16]-[S18] Concept section. [S17] mentions the main goal is to provide a reliable tool for the market. [S18] states the main goal as providing a reliable, relevant, performing, and continuously updated tool. This seems like the primary goal.\n\n[S19]-[S28] Certification process details. [S23]-[S25] talk about the approach and indicators, but not the main goal.\n\nSo, the main goal is mentioned in [S18] as providing a reliable, relevant, performing, and continuously updated tool. Also, [S7] mentions serving as an indicator of good financial governance. However, the question is about the main goal. The passage under the \"Concept\" section in [S17] and [S18] seems to highlight the primary objective. The user might be looking for the overarching purpose. \n\nBut wait, [S18] says the main goal is to provide the market with a reliable, relevant, etc., tool. That's a direct statement. However, the history section in [S9] mentions the certification was developed to identify healthy companies and minimize stock market crash impacts. But that might be more of a historical context rather than the main goal. \n\nThe question is about the main goal, so the answer should be the primary purpose as stated in the context. The sentence [S18] directly states the main goal. Additionally, [S7] mentions serving as an indicator of good financial governance, which could be part of the goal. However, the most explicit statement is in [S18]. \n\nSo the answer should be based on [S18]. But I need to check if there are other sentences that might contribute. Also, the user might need to cite all relevant sentences. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's question is about the main goal. The passage says in [S18]: \"The main goal is to provide the market with a reliable, relevant, performing and continuously updated tool.\" That's a direct answer. Also, [S7] mentions \"provides information on the best administrative and financial management practices and serves as an indicator of good financial governance.\" But [S18] is more specific about the main goal. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be based on [S18]. However, the user might need to include other sentences if they are relevant. But according to the instructions, each sentence in the answer must have citations. So the statement would be \"The main goal of the MSI 20000 certification is to provide the market with a reliable, relevant, performing, and continuously updated tool.\" Cited as [S18]. \n\nAlternatively, if there's another sentence that's more accurate. Let me check again. The \"Concept\" section starts with [S16], and [S17] says \"The main goal is to provide the market with a reliable...\" So that's the key sentence. Therefore, the answer is from [S18]."

The other sentences talk about MSI 20000 certification and international providers, but those seem unrelated. The key part here is \"according to the sector of activity\" which is mentioned in [S1]. So the basis is the sector of activity. The answer should cite [S1] because that's where the reason is given. The other sentences don't mention the basis for adaptation. So the answer is based on S1."

The key part here is \"valid for three years.\" \n\nThe other sentences: [S1] talks about analysis tools and evaluation criteria, which isn't relevant here.

I need to make sure there's no other information elsewhere. The user's question is straightforward, and the answer is explicitly stated in [S2]. No conflicting info elsewhere. So the correct citation is [S2]."

But it doesn't name specific organizations. So no citation here either.\n\n[S3] Starts with \"International certification providers\" and lists three organizations: COFICERT, SGS, and Dekra.

The citations would be [S3] for each of them since they are listed in that sentence.\n\nWait, the user wants the international organizations mentioned. The answer is COFICERT, SGS, and Dekra.

So the requirement is that the issuing body must be accredited or certified. \n\nThen there's S3, which lists international providers like COFICERT, SGS, and Dekra.
