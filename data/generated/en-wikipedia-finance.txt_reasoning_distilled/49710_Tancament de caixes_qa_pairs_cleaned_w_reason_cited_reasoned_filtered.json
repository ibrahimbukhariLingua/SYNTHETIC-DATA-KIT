  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the \"Tancament de caixes\" in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.\n\nThe main topic is a tax strike in Barcelona in 1899 by merchants and industrialists against tax hikes by the Silvela cabinet. The key points are the reasons: the Spanish-American War expenses leading to tax increases, the protest method of closing businesses (hartal), and the involvement of the mayor, Dr. Bartomeu Robert. The causes include the 1898 colonial crisis, higher taxes in Barcelona compared to Madrid, and the feeling of betrayal among the Catalan bourgeoisie. The consequences include the mayor's resignation, government ministers stepping down, and the rise of Catalan nationalism.\n\nI should make sure to mention the time period, the main actors (merchants, industrialists, mayor), the reasons (tax hikes, colonial crisis, war expenses), the methods (closing businesses, hartal), and the outcomes (resignations, nationalist movement). Need to keep it concise, avoiding too many names but highlighting the key consequences. Also, check if the main topic is clear and the key concepts are covered without extra details.\n</think>\n\nThe *tancament de caixes* (1899) was a tax strike in Barcelona led by merchants and industrialists against harsh tax increases by the Spanish government to fund the Spanish\u2013American War, exacerbated by the 1898 colonial crisis. Protesters shut down businesses in a hartal, avoiding taxes without legal repercussions, driven by resentment over higher taxes in Catalonia compared to Madrid and a sense of betrayal by the central government. The movement, organized by the Industrial & Commercial League of Defense and supported by Catalan guilds, led to government crackdowns, arrests, and the resignation of key officials, including Barcelona\u2019s mayor and Spanish ministers. It deepened Catalan nationalism by alienating the local bourgeoisie from the Spanish state, marking a pivotal moment in regional political tensions.",

      "question": "Who led the protest?",
      "answer": "<statement>The protest was led by the mayor of the city, Dr. Bartomeu Robert.<cite>[S3][S4]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is \"Who led the protest?\" and I need to find the answer in the provided supporting context.\n\nLooking at the passage, there are several sentences. Let me go through them one by one. \n\nSentence S1 is \"Tancament de caixes\" which seems to be the title, so probably not the answer. \n\nS2 talks about the protest being a tax strike by merchants and industrialists. Doesn't mention who led it. \n\nS3 says \"The protest was led by the mayor of the city, Dr.\" Hmm, that seems like a direct answer. But wait, the sentence is cut off? It says \"Dr.\" but doesn't finish. But maybe the name is in the next sentence? Let me check S4. \n\nS4 is \"Bartomeu Robert.\" So combining S3 and S4, it's saying the protest was led by the mayor, Dr. Bartomeu Robert. So the answer should be Bartomeu Robert. \n\nAre there any other sentences that mention leaders? Let's check the rest. S8 mentions the board of the Industrial & Commercial League of Defense issued a call, but that's an organization, not an individual. S9 talks about a Permanent Union Board, but again, not a person. \n\nSo the main answer is Bartomeu Robert, cited from S3 and S4. Wait, but the user wants each sentence to have its own citations. So the sentence that mentions the leader would be S3 and S4. But the actual answer is in S4. However, S3 says \"led by the mayor of the city, Dr.\" which is incomplete. But maybe the full name is in S4. So the correct citation would be S3 and S4. But the user's format requires each statement to have its citations. So if the statement is \"The protest was led by the mayor of the city, Dr.\" then that's S3. Then the next statement is \"Bartomeu Robert.\" which is S4. But the answer is Bartomeu Robert, so the citation would be S4. However, maybe the system considers that the information is spread across two sentences. But according to the instructions, each sentence is a separate statement. So the answer would be in S4, citing S4. But the user might need to combine S3 and S4. Wait, the question is asking for who led the protest. The answer is Bartomeu Robert. The sentence that states that is S4. However, S3 mentions that the protest was led by the mayor, Dr., which is incomplete. So maybe the correct citation is S3 and S4. But the user's example shows that if a sentence has citations, they are listed. So if the statement is \"The protest was led by the mayor of the city, Dr. Bartomeu Robert.\" then the citations would be S3 and S4. But in the given text, S3 and S4 are separate sentences. So perhaps the answer is in S4, but the name is introduced in S4. So the correct answer is Bartomeu Robert, cited from S4. However, the user might have intended that S3 and S4 together form the answer. But according to the structure, each sentence is separate. Therefore, the correct answer is in S4, so the citation is [S4]. But I need to check the original text again. \n\nLooking at the original text:\n\n[S3] The protest was led by the mayor of the city, Dr. [S4] Bartomeu Robert.\n\nSo S3 is \"The protest was led by the mayor of the city, Dr.\" and S4 is \"Bartomeu Robert.\" So the full name is in S4. Therefore, the answer is Bartomeu Robert, and the citation is S4. However, the sentence that mentions the leader is S3, but it's incomplete. So maybe the answer is in S4, but the citation would be S3 and S4. But the user's instructions say to cite the sentences that support the statement. If the statement is \"Bartomeu Robert led the protest,\" then the citation would be S4. But if the statement is \"The protest was led by the mayor of the city, Dr. Bartomeu Robert,\" then it's S3 and S4. However, in the given context, S3 and S4 are separate. So the answer is Bartomeu Robert, and the correct citation is S4. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is in S3, but the name is in S4. So the correct way is to have two statements: one citing S3 and another citing S4. But the user's question is a single question, so the answer would be a single statement. \n\nWait, the user's response format requires each sentence in the answer to be in <statement> tags with their own citations. So if the answer is \"Bartomeu Robert led the protest,\" then the statement would be that sentence, and the citation would be [S4]. But the original text doesn't have a sentence that says \"Bartomeu Robert led the protest.\" Instead, S3 says \"led by the mayor of the city, Dr.\" and S4 is \"Bartomeu Robert.\" So perhaps the answer is combining both sentences. But according to the instructions, each sentence in the answer must have its own citations. Therefore, the answer would be two statements: one stating that the protest was led by the mayor, Dr. (citing S3), and another stating Bartomeu Robert (citing S4). But the user's question is a single question, so maybe the answer is a single statement. However, the system might require that each sentence in the answer is properly cited. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"The protest was led by Dr. Bartomeu Robert,\" which would be a combination of S3 and S4. But since the original sentences are separate, perhaps the correct approach is to have two statements. However, the user's example shows that a single statement can have multiple citations. So if the answer is \"The protest was led by Dr. Bartomeu Robert,\" then the citations would be [S3][S4]. But in the original text, S3 ends with \"Dr.\" and S4 is \"Bartomeu Robert.\" So the full name is in S4. Therefore, the correct citation would be S3 and S4. \n\nBut the user's instructions say that each sentence in the answer should have its citations. So if the answer is a single sentence, then that sentence would need to cite both S3 and S4. Therefore, the answer would be: \n\n<statement>The protest was led by Dr. Bartomeu Robert.<cite>[S3][S4]</cite></statement>\n\nBut I need to check if that's acceptable. The original text has S3 and S4 as separate sentences, but the information is combined. So the answer would be correct with those citations. Therefore, the final answer is Bartomeu Robert, cited from S3 and S4."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking, \"What method did the protesters use?\" So I need to figure out the answer based on the provided supporting context.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the passage again. The key part here is probably the sentence that describes the action taken by the protesters. Let me check each sentence.\n\nLooking at [S1], it mentions \"Tancament de caixes\" which translates to \"closing of the cashboxes.\" Then [S2] says the protest consisted of shutting down business and industrial establishments as a form of hartal, which allowed them to stop paying tax without it being illegal. [S3] mentions the mayor leading it, but not the method. [S5] talks about the cause being the colonial crisis, but not the method. [S8] mentions the Industrial & Commercial League of Defense issued a call to protest. \n\nThe method here is the act of shutting down businesses and not paying taxes. The term \"hartal\" is mentioned in [S2], which is a form of strike or protest. So the main method is the shutdown of businesses and the cashboxes. The answer should be that they used the \"tancament de caixes\" method, which involved closing cashboxes and shutting down businesses. The citations would be [S1] and [S2], maybe [S8] as well? Wait, [S8] is about the call to protest, but the actual method is in [S2]. Also, [S5] mentions the shutting of the cashboxes. Let me check again.\n\n[S2] says the protest consisted of shutting down business and industrial establishments as a form of hartal. [S5] says the shutting of the cashboxes was caused by the crisis. So the method is the shutting down of businesses and the cashboxes. So the answer would be that they used the \"tancament de caixes\" method, which involved closing cashboxes and shutting down businesses. The citations would be [S1], [S2], and [S5]. Wait, but the question is about the method, so the key sentences are [S2] and [S5]. But [S1] is the term itself. So maybe [S1][S2][S5]. However, the user might need the exact sentences that describe the method. Let me check the exact wording.\n\nThe question is asking for the method, so the answer is the \"tancament de caixes\" (closing of the cashboxes) which involved shutting down businesses. So the sentences that mention this are [S1], [S2], and [S5]. But [S5] explains the cause, while [S2] describes the action. So the main citations would be [S1] and [S2]. Also, [S8] mentions the call to protest, but that's more about the organization than the method. So the answer should be based on [S2] and [S1]. Let me make sure there's no other sentence. [S10] mentions the government declaring a state of emergency, but that's a consequence. So the answer is the method was the \"tancament de caixes\" as described in [S2], which is the shutting down of businesses. Therefore, the citations are [S1] and [S2]. But [S1] is the name of the method, and [S2] explains it. So the statement would be that the protesters used the \"tancament de caixes\" method, citing [S1] and [S2]. Alternatively, if the answer is the shutting down of businesses, then [S2] and [S5]. But [S5] is more about the cause. Maybe just [S2]. But the user might need all relevant citations. Let me check the exact sentences again.\n\nThe answer is the method is the \"tancament de caixes\" which is the closing of cashboxes. The sentence that defines it is [S1], and [S2] explains that it involved shutting down businesses. So the citations would be [S1] and [S2]. Also, [S5] mentions the shutting of the cashboxes, so maybe [S5] as well. But the question is about the method, so the main answer is the action taken, which is shutting down businesses and cashboxes. So the correct citations are [S2] and [S5]. Wait, [S5] says \"The shutting of the cashboxes was caused by...\" so it's the action. So [S2] and [S5]. But [S2] says the protest consisted of shutting down businesses as a form of hartal. So the method is the shutdown of businesses and the cashboxes. Therefore, the answer should cite [S2] and [S5]. However, [S1] is the term itself, but maybe the answer doesn't need that. The user might want the sentences that explain the method. So the answer would be that the protesters used the method of shutting down business and industrial establishments, which is in [S2], and the shutting of the cashboxes in [S5]. So the citations would be [S2] and [S5]. Alternatively, [S1] is the name, but the method is described in [S2]. I think the answer is [S2] and [S5]. Let me check again. The question is \"What method did the protesters use?\" The answer is the \"tancament de caixes\" which is the closing of cashboxes, which involved shutting down businesses. So the sentences that mention this are [S1], [S2], and [S5]. But the user might need to cite all of them. However, the instruction says to provide citations of the sentence number. So the answer would be: The protesters used the method of shutting down business and industrial establishments, which is described in [S2], and the shutting of the cashboxes mentioned in [S5]. Therefore, the statement would be: \"The protesters used the method of shutting down business and industrial establishments, which allowed them to stop paying tax without it being illegal.\" Citing [S2]. Additionally, the term \"tancament de caixes\" is in [S1], but maybe that's the name, not the method. So the main citation is [S2]. But the user might need to include [S5] as well. I think the best answer is [S2] and [S5]. But I need to check the exact wording. The question is about the method, so the answer is the action taken, which is the shutdown of businesses and cashboxes. So the sentences that describe this are [S2] and [S5]. Therefore, the citations would be [S2][S5]. Alternatively, [S1] is the name, but the method is in [S2]. I think the answer should be [S2] and [S5]. Let me confirm. The user's example had [S3][S8] for a sentence. So in this case, the answer would be a statement citing [S2] and [S5]. But maybe [S1] is also relevant. However, [S1] is the title, so maybe not. The answer is the method, which is described in [S2] and [S5]. So the final answer would be a statement with those citations."

The citation would be [S3] and [S12]. Wait, [S3] says \"The protest was led by the mayor of the city, Dr.\" and then [S4] is \"Bartomeu Robert.\" So maybe [S3] and [S4] together? But the question is about who resigned. The consequence in [S12] explicitly mentions \"resignation of Barcelona mayor Doctor Robert.\" So [S12] is a citation. But the name is first mentioned in [S3] and [S4]. However, the exact sentence that states the resignation is [S12]. So the answer should cite [S12]. But the name is introduced in [S3] and [S4]. However, the user's instruction says to cite the sentences that support the answer. The answer is \"Dr. Bartomeu Robert\" and the resignation is mentioned in [S12]. So the statement would be \"Dr. Bartomeu Robert resigned as Barcelona mayor after the protest.\" The citation would be [S12]. But maybe also [S3] and [S4] if they are needed to identify the person. However, the question is about who resigned, so the key citation is [S12]. But let me check again. The user's example shows that if a sentence has citations, they are listed.

So the answer is Dr. Bartomeu Robert, cited from [S12]. However, the name is first introduced in [S3] and [S4]. But the user's instructions say to cite the sentences that support the answer. Since the resignation is stated in [S12], that's the main citation. But maybe the name is in [S3] and [S4]. However, the way the context is structured, [S3] says \"led by the mayor of the city, Dr.\" and [S4] is \"Bartomeu Robert.\" So together, they identify the mayor. But the actual resignation is in [S12]. So perhaps the answer should cite [S12], and maybe [S3] and [S4] if needed. But the user's example shows that each sentence is in its own statement.

      "question": "What was the outcome for the Spanish government?",
      "answer": "<statement>The outcome for the Spanish government included the resignations of ministers Manuel Dur\u00e1n i Bas and Camilo Garc\u00eda de Polavieja y Castillo, as well as the alienation of the Catalan middle class, which strengthened Catalan nationalism.<cite>[S12]</cite></statement> <statement>The government also declared a state of emergency during the protest.<cite>[S10]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking about the outcome for the Spanish government. I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each sentence in the chunk. The passage starts by explaining what the \"tancament de caixes\" was, a tax strike in 1899. Then it mentions the causes, like the colonial crisis of 1898 leading to tax increases. The protest was led by Bartomeu Robert, and there's a list of consequences at the end.\n\nLooking at the sentences, S10 says the government declared a state of emergency. Then in the consequences section, there are three points: the resignation of Barcelona's mayor, the resignations of two Spanish government ministers, and the alienation of the Catalan middle class leading to stronger Catalan nationalism. \n\nThe question is about the outcome for the Spanish government. The resignations of the ministers (S12) would be a direct outcome. Also, the alienation of the Catalan middle class (S12) is another consequence. However, the mayor's resignation is mentioned, but he was the mayor of Barcelona, not the Spanish government. So the key points here are the resignations of the ministers and the political fallout with Catalan nationalism. \n\nI need to check if the sentences are correctly cited. The consequences are listed in S12, so the answer should reference that. The statement about the resignations of the ministers is in S12. The alienation leading to Catalan nationalism is also in S12. So the answer should include those points with the citation [S12]."

      "chunk": "Chunk:\n\n[S1] Tancament de caixes\n\n\n# Tancament de caixes\n\n\n\nThe ***tancament de caixes*** (\"closing of the cashboxes\") was a tax strike in the period of July to November 1899 in Barcelona by merchants and industrialists against tax hikes put in place by the Francisco Silvela cabinet and his minister of the Treasury, Raimundo Fern\u00e1ndez Villaverde in order to pay for the expenses of the Spanish\u2013American War. [S2] The protest consisted of shutting down business and industrial establishments as a form of hartal which allowed them to stop paying tax without it being illegal. [S3] The protest was led by the mayor of the city, Dr. [S4] Bartomeu Robert. [S5] The shutting of the cashboxes was caused by the colonial crisis of 1898, which led the Spanish government to impose some restrictive budgets along with an increase in taxation to compensate for the deficit. [S6] The protest was primarily against the corporate and personal income tax, and that on personal bonds, which had higher rates in Barcelona than in Madrid. [S7] That created a feeling of having been betrayed among the Catalan bourgeoisie, as they had fought alongside the dynastic parties. [S8] The board of the Industrial & Commercial League of Defense issued a call to protest. [S9] A Permanent Union Board was chosen, representing more than fifty Barcelona guilds. [S10] The government declared a state of emergency. [S11] The protest extended to Sabadell, Matar\u00f3, Manresa and Villafranca del Penedes, and some business-owners were arrested for not paying taxes. [S12] ## Consequences\n\n* the resignation of Barcelona mayor Doctor Robert (1842-1902)\n* the resignations of the Spanish government ministers Manuel Dur\u00e1n i Bas (1823-1907) and Camilo Garcia of Polavieja and Castillo\n* the alienation of the Catalan middle class from the Spanish government and consequent strengthening of Catalan nationalism",
      "question": "How did the Catalan bourgeoisie's relationship with the Spanish government change?",
      "answer": "<statement>The Catalan bourgeoisie's relationship with the Spanish government shifted from support to alienation due to tax policies and perceived betrayal. The tax hikes imposed by the Silvela cabinet, particularly higher rates on corporate and personal income in Barcelona compared to Madrid, fueled resentment. This led to a feeling of betrayal among the Catalan bourgeoisie, who had previously aligned with dynastic parties. The protest, including the \"tancament de caixes,\" marked a turning point, resulting in the alienation of the Catalan middle class from the Spanish government and the rise of Catalan nationalism.<cite>[S5][S6][S7][S12]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking how the Catalan bourgeoisie's relationship with the Spanish government changed. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the sentences. Sentence S5 mentions the colonial crisis of 1898 leading to restrictive budgets and tax increases. Then S6 talks about the protest being against specific taxes, which were higher in Barcelona than Madrid. That might have caused resentment. \n\nLooking at S7, it directly states that the protest created a feeling of betrayal among the Catalan bourgeoisie because they had supported the dynastic parties. This suggests their trust in the government was broken. \n\nThen there's S8 about the Industrial & Commercial League's call to protest, and S9 mentioning the Permanent Union Board. But the key part is S12, which lists the consequences. One of them is the alienation of the Catalan middle class from the Spanish government, leading to stronger Catalan nationalism. \n\nSo the main points are the tax hikes, the feeling of betrayal, and the resulting alienation. The answer should connect these points, citing S5, S6, S7, and S12. Let me make sure each citation is correctly placed. The statement about the feeling of betrayal is in S7, and the consequence is in S12. The tax reasons are in S5 and S6. That should cover the change in their relationship."
