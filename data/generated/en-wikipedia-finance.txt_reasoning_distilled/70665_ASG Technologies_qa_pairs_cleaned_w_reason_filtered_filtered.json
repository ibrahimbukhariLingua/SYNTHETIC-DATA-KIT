  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about ASG Technologies in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main topic is ASG Technologies, which is a provider of enterprise information management and IT system management solutions. The document mentions their history, acquisitions, and funding. They were founded in 1986 as Allen Systems Group by Arthur L. Allen. Then in 2015, they rebranded to ASG Technologies Group under new owners KKR and Evergreen Coast Capital, with Charles Sansbury as CEO. In 2016, they had 3,000 customers in 60 countries with 41 offices. They acquired Mowbly in 2018 and were acquired by Rocket in 2021.\n\nSo the key points are the company's founding, rebranding, ownership changes, customer base, acquisitions, and the 2021 acquisition by Rocket. I need to condense this into a concise summary. Make sure to mention the main services, the history, the acquisitions, and the final acquisition by Rocket. Avoid minor details like the exact dates unless they're crucial. Check for any other important info, like the transition from Allen Systems Group to ASG Technologies Group. Also, note the change in leadership and the expansion of their customer base. The summary should flow logically, starting with the company's role, then history, key events, and the latest acquisition.\n</think>\n\nASG Technologies, originally founded in 1986 as Allen Systems Group by Arthur L. Allen, provides enterprise information management and IT system management solutions. The company rebranded as ASG Technologies Group in 2015 under new ownership by KKR & Co. and Evergreen Coast Capital, expanding its global presence to 41 offices and 3,000 customers across 60 countries by 2016. It acquired Mowbly, a business process mobility platform, in 2018 and was subsequently acquired by Rocket in 2021. The summary highlights its evolution from a regional firm to a globally active technology provider through strategic acquisitions and ownership changes.",

The supporting context provided starts with \"ASG Technologies\" and then in the next line, there's a mention of **ASG Technologies Group, Inc.**, doing business as **ASG Technologies**. \n\nSo, the full name is probably ASG Technologies Group, Inc. The citation for that sentence is [S1] and [S2], but wait, looking at the context, the first line is [S1] ASG Technologies, then the next part is under a heading. The sentence that mentions the full name is in the chunk where it says \"**ASG Technologies Group, Inc.**, doing business as **ASG Technologies**.\" The citation for that specific sentence is [S1] and [S2]? Wait, the structure here is a bit confusing. Let me check again.\n\nThe user provided the supporting context as a chunk. The first line is [S1] ASG Technologies. Then there's a section heading # ASG Technologies. Then the next sentence is \"**ASG Technologies Group, Inc.**, doing business as **ASG Technologies**.\" The citation for that sentence would be [S1] and [S2]? Wait, the original chunk might have the sentences numbered. Let me parse the supporting context again.\n\nLooking at the supporting context:\n\nChunk:\n\n[S1] ASG Technologies\n\n\n# ASG Technologies\n\n\n\n**ASG Technologies Group, Inc.**, doing business as **ASG Technologies**, is a provider of enterprise information management and IT System Management Solutions Software. [S2] ## History, acquisitions and funding\n\nSo the sentence that gives the full name is in [S2], but the actual sentence starts with **ASG Technologies Group, Inc.**. So the full name is ASG Technologies Group, Inc. The citation for that sentence is [S2]. But the first line is [S1] ASG Technologies. However, the question is about the full name, which is in the sentence that starts with **ASG Technologies Group, Inc.**, which is in [S2]. So the answer should be ASG Technologies Group, Inc. with citation [S2].\n\nWait, but the user's supporting context might have the sentences structured differently. Let me check again. The user's supporting context is presented as:\n\nChunk:\n\n[S1] ASG Technologies\n\n\n# ASG Technologies\n\n\n\n**ASG Technologies Group, Inc.**, doing business as **ASG Technologies**, is a provider of enterprise information management and IT System Management Solutions Software. [S2] ## History, acquisitions and funding\n\nSo the sentence that mentions the full name is in [S2], but the actual text is \"**ASG Technologies Group, Inc.**, doing business as **ASG Technologies**.\" So the full name is ASG Technologies Group, Inc., and the citation is [S2]. Therefore, the answer should be that the full name is ASG Technologies Group, Inc., cited from [S2]."

The first sentence under \"Chunk\" says: \"ASG Technologies Group, Inc., doing business as ASG Technologies, is a provider of enterprise information management and IT System Management Solutions Software.\" That seems directly relevant. The key terms here are \"enterprise information management\" and \"IT System Management Solutions Software.\" \n\nLooking at the other sentences, there's information about the company's history, acquisitions, and financial details, but nothing that contradicts the primary focus mentioned in the first sentence. The question is about the main focus, so the answer is likely in that first sentence. \n\nI should check if any other parts of the context mention their software solutions. For example, the acquisition of Mowbly in 2018 might relate to their solutions, but the context doesn't specify what Mowbly's platform does. The mention of \"business process mobility platform\" could be part of their IT solutions, but the primary focus is still stated in the first sentence. \n\nNo other sentences in the context explicitly state the primary focus. So the answer is from sentence S1. The user wants the answer in the specified format with citations. Since the primary focus is in S1, the citation would be [S1]. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other sentence that might contribute. For instance, S2 talks about history, S3 about founding, etc. None of them mention the software focus. So the correct citation is S1."

      "answer": "<statement>In 2015, Allen Systems Group turned into ASG Technologies Group under a consortium of new owners led by KKR & Co. [S5] L.P. [S6] and Evergreen Coast Capital, with Charles Sansbury as CEO.<cite>[S4]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking which private equity firm is mentioned as part of the consortium in 2015. The supporting context provided has several sentences with citations.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context for mentions of a consortium in 2015. Let me go through each sentence. \n\nLooking at [S4]: \"In 2015, Allen Systems Group turned into ASG Technologies Group under a consortium of new owners led by KKR & Co. [S5] L.P. [S6] and Evergreen Coast Capital, with Charles Sansbury as CEO.\" \n\nSo here, the consortium in 2015 is mentioned. The firms listed are KKR & Co. L.P. and Evergreen Coast Capital. The question is about the private equity firm. KKR & Co. is a well-known private equity firm. Evergreen Coast Capital might also be a private equity firm, but the question might be looking for KKR as the main one. \n\nWait, the sentence structure here is a bit unclear. The citation numbers [S5] and [S6] are attached to \"KKR & Co. L.P.\" and \"Evergreen Coast Capital\"? Or is the entire phrase under the consortium led by KKR & Co. L.P. and Evergreen Coast Capital? The way it's written, \"led by KKR & Co. [S5] L.P. [S6] and Evergreen Coast Capital\" – maybe the citations are misplaced. But according to the given context, the sentence [S4] mentions the consortium led by KKR & Co. L.P. and Evergreen Coast Capital. \n\nSo the answer would be KKR & Co. L.P. and Evergreen Coast Capital. But the question says \"private equity firm\" – are both of these private equity firms? KKR is definitely a private equity firm. Evergreen Coast Capital – I'm not as sure, but based on the context, since it's mentioned as part of the consortium, it's likely a private equity firm. However, the question might be expecting KKR as the answer. \n\nBut the user is asking for the firm mentioned as part of the consortium. The sentence [S4] mentions both. So the answer should include both. But the question is singular: \"Which private equity firm...\" Maybe there's only one. Let me check again. \n\nThe sentence says \"led by KKR & Co. [S5] L.P. [S6] and Evergreen Coast Capital\". The citations [S5] and [S6] are after \"KKR & Co.\" and \"L.P.\"? Maybe the original text has some formatting issues. But according to the given context, the consortium in 2015 included KKR & Co. L.P. and Evergreen Coast Capital. \n\nSo the answer would be both, but the question might be looking for KKR. However, since the user wants the exact answer based on the context, I should list both. But the question says \"private equity firm\" – maybe both are correct. \n\nWait, the user's question is \"Which private equity firm is mentioned as part of the consortium in 2015?\" So the answer is KKR & Co. L.P. and Evergreen Coast Capital. But the way the sentence is structured, maybe the consortium is led by KKR & Co. L.P. and Evergreen Coast Capital. So both are part of the consortium. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be both. But the user might expect KKR as the main one. However, according to the context, both are mentioned. So I need to check the citations. The sentence [S4] is the one that mentions the consortium. The citations in that sentence are [S4], and then [S5] and [S6] are attached to KKR & Co. and L.P.?\n\nWait, looking at the original context:\n\n[S4] In 2015, Allen Systems Group turned into ASG Technologies Group under a consortium of new owners led by KKR & Co. [S5] L.P. [S6] and Evergreen Coast Capital, with Charles Sansbury as CEO.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ\n\nSo the sentence [S4] has the text \"led by KKR & Co. [S5] L.P. [S6] and Evergreen Coast Capital\". The citations [S5] and [S6] are probably attached to \"KKR & Co.\" and \"L.P.\" respectively. But that might be a formatting error. Alternatively, maybe the entire phrase \"KKR & Co. L.P.\" is cited as [S5], and then [S6] is for \"Evergreen Coast Capital\". But the way it's written here is a bit confusing. However, the key point is that the consortium in 2015 included KKR & Co. L.P. and Evergreen Coast Capital. \n\nSo the answer is both. But the question is phrased as \"Which private equity firm...\" – maybe there are two. However, the user might expect the answer to be KKR & Co. L.P. as the primary one. But according to the context, both are part of the consortium. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be KKR & Co. L.P. and Evergreen Coast Capital. But I need to check if the question allows multiple answers. The user's instruction says \"answer the questions and provide citations of the sentence number.\" So the answer should be the names of the firms mentioned in the consortium in 2015, with the citation from [S4]. \n\nBut the sentence [S4] is the one that mentions the consortium. So the citation would be [S4]. However, the citations [S5] and [S6] are in the sentence, but they might be part of the same sentence. Wait, the original context's sentence [S4] is:\n\n\"In 2015, Allen Systems Group turned into ASG Technologies Group under a consortium of new owners led by KKR & Co. [S5] L.P. [S6] and Evergreen Coast Capital, with Charles Sansbury as CEO.\"\n\nSo the sentence [S4] includes the text \"led by KKR & Co. [S5] L.P. [S6] and Evergreen Coast Capital\". So the citations [S5] and [S6] are part of the same sentence. Therefore, the sentence [S4] is the one that mentions the consortium, and the citations [S5] and [S6] are for the parts \"KKR & Co.\" and \"L.P.\" respectively. But the question is about the private equity firm in the consortium. So the answer would be KKR & Co. L.P. and Evergreen Coast Capital. \n\nBut the user might expect only KKR. However, based on the context, both are mentioned. Therefore, the answer should include both. But the question is singular: \"Which private equity firm...\" Maybe the answer is KKR & Co. L.P., as Evergreen Coast Capital might not be a private equity firm. But without external knowledge, I have to go by the context. Since the context mentions both as part of the consortium, they are both part of the answer. \n\nSo the final answer would be KKR & Co. L.P. and Evergreen Coast Capital, with the citation [S4]. However, the citations [S5] and [S6] are in the same sentence. But according to the instructions, each sentence's citations are listed. So the sentence [S4] would have citations [S5] and [S6], but the main citation for the consortium part would be [S4]. Wait, no. The sentence [S4] is the one that contains the information about the consortium. The [S5] and [S6] are citations for the parts \"KKR & Co.\" and \"L.P.\" Maybe the original text had those citations for those specific parts. But the question is about the consortium in 2015, so the main citation is [S4]. However, the user's instructions say to cite the sentence numbers that support the statement. \n\nSo if the statement is \"the consortium in 2015 included KKR & Co. L.P. and Evergreen Coast Capital,\" then the citation would be [S4]. But if the statement is about KKR & Co. L.P., then [S5] and [S6] might be relevant. But the question is about the consortium, so the main citation is [S4]. \n\nBut the user's example shows that each sentence's citations are listed. So the answer would be a statement that says \"The private equity firms mentioned as part of the consortium in 2015 are KKR & Co. L.P. and Evergreen Coast Capital.\" And the citation would be [S4]. However, the original sentence [S4] has [S5] and [S6] in it. But according to the instructions, the citations should be the sentence numbers that support the statement. So if the statement is about the consortium in 2015, then [S4] is the citation. But if the statement is about KKR & Co. L.P., then [S5] and [S6]. \n\nBut the question is about the consortium, so the answer is in [S4]. Therefore, the correct citation is [S4]. However, the original sentence [S4] includes the text \"led by KKR & Co. [S5] L.P. [S6] and Evergreen Coast Capital\". So the citations [S5] and [S6] are part of the same sentence. But the user's instructions say to put the citations at the end of each sentence. So the sentence [S4] would have citations [S5] and [S6], but the main point is that the consortium is mentioned in [S4]. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. But according to the given context, the answer is KKR & Co. L.P. and Evergreen Coast Capital, with the citation [S4]. However, the way the citations are placed in the original text might mean that [S5] and [S6] are for the parts \"KKR & Co.\" and \"L.P.\" respectively. But the question is about the consortium, so the main citation is [S4]. \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be:\n\n<statement>The private equity firm mentioned as part of the consortium in 2015 is KKR & Co. L.P. and Evergreen Coast Capital.<cite>[S4]</cite></statement>"
