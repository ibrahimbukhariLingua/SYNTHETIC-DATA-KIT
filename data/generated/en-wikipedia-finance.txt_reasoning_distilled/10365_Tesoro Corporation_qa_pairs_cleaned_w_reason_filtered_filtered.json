  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Tesoro Corporation in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document begins by introducing Tesoro as a Fortune 500 company based in San Antonio, with $35 billion in 2017 revenue and over 14,000 employees. It mentions their refineries in the Western US, retail stations, and their acquisition by Marathon Petroleum in 2018. The history section talks about their founding in 1968, growth through acquisitions, and key milestones like refinery expansions and name changes. There's also info on their environmental issues, an explosion in 2010, and controversies like sourcing oil from the Amazon.\n\nThe main topic here is Tesoro Corporation's operations, growth, and significant events. Key concepts include their role as a major refiner, acquisitions, the merger with Marathon, environmental controversies, and the Anacortes explosion. I need to highlight these points concisely. I should mention their status as a Fortune 500 company, their refining and marketing activities, the acquisition by Marathon, and the controversies. Also, note the name change to Andeavor before the merger. Avoid minor details like specific years unless they're crucial. Make sure each sentence covers a distinct aspect without overlapping. Check for clarity and that it's within the sentence limit.\n</think>\n\nTesoro Corporation, a Fortune 500 company based in San Antonio, Texas, was a major independent petroleum refiner and marketer with 10 Western U.S. refineries and 3,000 retail gas stations before its 2018 acquisition by Marathon Petroleum, forming the largest U.S. refiner. Founded in 1968, it expanded through strategic acquisitions, growing refining capacity to 664,000 barrels per day and rebranding as Andeavor in 2017. The company faced environmental controversies, including being a top air pollutant emitter, involvement in a 2010 refinery explosion in Washington, and criticism for sourcing Amazonian crude oil. Its merger with Marathon Petroleum marked a significant shift in the U.S. refining industry, consolidating its legacy as a key player in energy production and distribution.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking about Tesoro Corporation's ranking on the 2018 Fortune 500 list. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nLooking at the chunks, [S1] mentions Tesoro Corporation but doesn't talk about the ranking. Then in [S2], it says \"Based on 2017 revenue, the company ranked No. [S3] 90 in the 2018 *Fortune* 500 list...\" So that seems to directly answer the question. The number 90 is mentioned here. \n\nI should check if there's any other information that might contradict this or add more context. The rest of the sentences talk about other details like the company's operations, history, and acquisition, but nothing else about the Fortune 500 ranking. \n\nSo the answer should be that Tesoro Corporation was ranked 90th on the 2018 Fortune 500 list. The citation here is [S3], but wait, the sentence in [S2] mentions the ranking. However, the way the chunks are numbered, [S2] is the sentence that starts with \"Based on 2017 revenue...\" and [S3] is the next sentence which is \"90 in the 2018...\" So maybe the correct citation is [S3]? But the actual sentence that states the ranking is in [S2], but the number is in [S3]. Wait, looking at the structure:\n\n[S2] \"Based on 2017 revenue, the company ranked No. [S3] 90 in the 2018 *Fortune* 500 list...\"\n\nSo the sentence [S2] has a citation [S3] inside it. But according to the instructions, each sentence is in <statement> tags, and the citations are at the end. So maybe the actual sentence that contains the ranking is [S2], but the citation is [S3]. Wait, but the way the chunks are presented, each [S1], [S2], etc., is a separate sentence. So [S2] is \"Based on 2017 revenue, the company ranked No. \" and [S3] is \"90 in the 2018 *Fortune* 500 list...\" So the full sentence is split into two parts. That's a bit confusing. But according to the given chunks, the answer is in [S3], but the sentence [S2] is incomplete. However, the user's instruction says to use the supporting context as given. So perhaps the correct citation is [S3], since that's where the number is. But the actual statement that includes the ranking would be combining [S2] and [S3], but since they are separate sentences, maybe each has their own citations. Wait, the user's example shows that each sentence is in its own <statement> with citations. So if [S2] is a sentence that starts with \"Based on 2017 revenue, the company ranked No. \" and [S3] is \"90 in the 2018 *Fortune* 500 list...\", then the full sentence is split. But in the context provided, each [S] is a separate sentence. So perhaps the answer is in [S3], but the sentence [S3] is \"90 in the 2018 *Fortune* 500 list...\" which is part of the larger sentence. However, the user's instruction says to answer based on the supporting context, so I need to check if the answer is present. The question is asking for the ranking, which is \"No. 90\". So the correct citation would be [S3], as that's where the number is. But the sentence that includes the ranking is [S2] and [S3] together. However, since the system requires each sentence to be in its own <statement>, maybe the answer is in [S3], but the actual statement would be [S2] and [S3] combined. But given the way the chunks are split, perhaps the answer is in [S3]. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the answer is in [S3], so the citation is [S3]. Therefore, the answer is 90th, cited from [S3]."

For example, [S14] mentions \"six petroleum refineries situated in California, Alaska, Washington, Hawaii, North Dakota, and Utah.\" Wait, that's six, but the question is about the Western United States. Are all those states considered part of the West? California, Alaska, Washington, Hawaii, North Dakota, Utah... Hmm, Utah is more in the Mountain West, but North Dakota is part of the Midwest. However, the original answer in [S4] says ten. Maybe [S14] is referring to an earlier time or a different count. But the question is about the Western US, so maybe the answer is ten as per [S4]. \n\nBut why the discrepancy? Maybe [S14] is part of the history, and [S4] is a more current statement. The user's question doesn't specify a time frame, but since the context includes the 2017 data, and [S4] is part of that, it's likely that [S4] is the correct answer. Also, [S17] mentions acquisitions expanding refining capacity, which might have increased the number. So the answer is ten refineries in the West. The citation would be [S4]. \n\nI should make sure there's no other sentence. [S14] mentions six, but maybe that's part of the history.

[S6] 3,000 branded retail gas stations, of which more than 595 were company-operated under its own Tesoro brandname, as well as Shell, ExxonMobil, ARCO, and USA Gasoline brands. [S7] Tesoro, known at the time as Andeavor, was acquired by Marathon Petroleum on October 1, 2018. [S8] ## History\n\nTesoro was founded in 1968 by Dr. [S9] Robert Van Osdell West Jr (1921–2006), and was primarily engaged in petroleum exploration and production. [S10] Tesoro began operating its first refinery, near Kenai, Alaska, in 1969. [S11] Tesoro became the first Fortune 500 company to be headquartered in San Antonio, Texas. [S12] *Tesoro* is the word for *treasure* (or *treasury*) in Italian and Spanish. [S13] Beginning in the late 1990s, Tesoro grew through a series of acquisitions and initiatives that created Tesoro Corporation, the company focusing on the core business of petroleum refining, marketing, maritime transportation and distribution. [S14] The first segment involved the operation of six petroleum refineries situated in California, Alaska, Washington, Hawaii, North Dakota, and Utah. [S15] For its marketing and distribution segment, Tesoro sold refined gas and fuel products in both bulk and wholesale markets. [S16] Acquisitions expanded refining capacity from 72,000 barrels per day (11,400 m³/d) to approximately 664,000 barrels per day (105,600 m³/d). [S17] Prior to its acquisition by Marathon Petroleum in 2018, Tesoro was the third-largest independent petroleum refining and marketing company in the United States. [S18] The merger between the two companies formed the largest American refiner by capacity and the fifth in the world. [S19] Milestones in Tesoro's history are:",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking who founded Tesoro Corporation and in which year. So, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find that information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for any mentions of the founder and the year. The chunk starts with \"Tesoro Corporation\" and then there's a section labeled \"History\". In the History section, I see sentence [S8] mentions \"Tesoro, known at the time as Andeavor, was acquired by Marathon Petroleum on October 1, 2018.\" But that's about the acquisition, not the founding.\n\nContinuing down, sentence [S9] says: \"Tesoro was founded in 1968 by Dr. Robert Van Osdell West Jr (1921–2006), and was primarily engaged in petroleum exploration and production.\" That seems to answer both parts of the question. The founder is Dr. Robert Van Osdell West Jr., and the year is 1968. \n\nI should check if there's any other information that might contradict this or add more context. The rest of the sentences talk about refineries, acquisitions, and other milestones, but nothing about the founder. So [S9] is the key sentence here. \n\nThe user wants the answer with citations in the specified format. So the statement should include the founder's name and the year, with the citation [S9]. I need to make sure there are no other citations needed here. Since the question is straightforward and the answer is directly in [S9], that's the only citation required."

[S5] ## Media controversy\n\n\n### Environmental record\n\nHaving taken over BP installations, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute identified Tesoro as being the 24th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, releasing roughly 3,740,000 lb (1,700 t) of toxic chemicals annually.

[S8] Tesoro was listed as a *de minimis* contributor to a superfund site in Abbeville, LA, and the site has since been closed by the EPA. [S9] Tesoro gave over $1 million in support of California Proposition 23, which aimed to suspend the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006.

[S11] Three of Tesoro's refineries - Anacortes (WA), LA (CA) and Golden Eagle (CA), were known to process Amazonian crude oil. [S12] ### Explosion\n\nOn April 2, 2010, an explosion at Tesoro's refinery in Anacortes, Washington, killed seven workers. [S13] ### Hawaii refinery\n\nSo, in the context, [S1] mentions the acquisition by Marathon in 2018. [S2] talks about the merger forming the largest American refiner. Then later, [S5] is part of the media controversy section, but looking at the text, [S5] is actually part of the previous section. Wait, the user's context has [S1] to [S13], but in the text, after the milestones list, there's [S4] and [S5], but maybe the numbering is off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user's context has:\n\nAfter the milestones list, there's:\n\n* 2016/17: Par Pacific Inc. [S4] rebrands its Tesoro and 76 gas stations as HELE;\n* 2017: Tesoro announces its change of name to Andeavor following its acquisition of Western Refining; On August 1, 2017, the company changed its ticker symbol to \"ANDV\" from \"TSO\";\n* 2018: Andeavor announced its entering into a definitive merger agreement with Marathon Petroleum with Marathon Petroleum acquiring all of Andeavor's outstanding shares; the merger was closed on October 1. [S5] ## Media controversy\n\nSo [S4] is part of the milestones list, and [S5] is after that. Then the Environmental record starts. So the relevant sentences are [S1], [S2], and [S5]. Wait, but [S5] is part of the Media controversy section. However, the actual merger details are in [S1] and [S2]. \n\nThe question is about the outcome of the merger. The outcome would be that the merger formed the largest American refiner by capacity and fifth in the world (from [S2]), and that Tesoro was acquired by Marathon Petroleum in 2018 (from [S1]). Also, [S5] mentions the merger being closed on October 1, 2018. But the user's context might have [S5] as part of the Media controversy, but the actual merger details are in [S1] and [S2]. \n\nSo the answer should combine the information from [S1] and [S2]. The outcome is that the merger created the largest American refiner by capacity and fifth globally, and that Tesoro was acquired by Marathon Petroleum. So the sentences would be:\n\n- \"Prior to its acquisition by Marathon Petroleum in 2018, Tesoro was the third-largest independent petroleum refining and marketing company in the United States.\" [S1]\n\n- \"The merger between the two companies formed the largest American refiner by capacity and the fifth in the world.\" [S2]\n\nBut the question is about the outcome, so the key points are the formation of the largest refiner and the acquisition. So the answer would be a statement combining these, citing [S1] and [S2]. However, the user's instructions require each sentence to be in <statement> tags with citations. So if the answer is two sentences, each with their citations. But the user might expect a single statement. Wait, the user's example shows two sentences, each in their own <statement> tags. So the answer should be structured as such.\n\nSo the answer would be:\n\n<statement>Tesoro was acquired by Marathon Petroleum in 2018, forming the largest American refiner by capacity and the fifth in the world.<cite>[S1][S2]</cite></statement>\n\nBut need to check if the sentences are separate. Alternatively, if the answer requires separate statements. But the user's example has two sentences. However, the question is a single question, so maybe one statement. But the user's example shows two sentences. Let me check the user's instruction again.\n\nThe user says: \"Each Sentence is inside the <statement> tags. At the end of each Sentence there are <cite> tags which contains all the citations linked to that sentence.\"\n\nSo if the answer requires multiple sentences, each with their own citations. But in this case, the outcome is two points: the acquisition and the formation of the largest refiner. So two sentences. But maybe they can be combined into one sentence with both citations.\n\nAlternatively, if the answer is one sentence combining both points, citing both [S1] and [S2]. That would be acceptable. So the final answer would be a single statement with both citations."

The environmental record and other sections don't mention 2010. The answer is the explosion that killed seven workers. The citation would be [S13]. So the statement should be that the explosion occurred, citing S13."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking when Tesoro changed its name to Andeavor and what the ticker symbol change was. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information. Let me scan through the sentences.\n\nLooking at the chunks, there's a section labeled [S4] which mentions rebranding to HELE, but that's about gas stations. Then, further down, there's a sentence in the middle of the chunk: \"2017: Tesoro announces its change of name to Andeavor following its acquisition of Western Refining; On August 1, 2017, the company changed its ticker symbol to 'ANDV' from 'TSO';\". That seems to directly answer both parts of the question. \n\nSo the name change happened in 2017, specifically August 1, 2017. The ticker symbol changed from TSO to ANDV. The citation here would be [S4] and [S5]? Wait, let me check the numbering again. The sentence about the name change is in the chunk that's labeled [S4] and [S5]? Wait, looking at the context, the sentence is part of the chunk that starts with [S4] and then there's [S5] at the end. But the actual sentence about the name change is in the middle. Let me check the exact text.\n\nThe exact sentence is: \"2017: Tesoro announces its change of name to Andeavor following its acquisition of Western Refining; On August 1, 2017, the company changed its ticker symbol to \"ANDV\" from \"TSO\";\". This is under the [S4] section? Wait, the chunk is labeled [S4] and then [S5] is at the end. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the supporting context, the line with the name change is in the middle of the chunk. The user's context shows that the line \"2017: Tesoro announces its change of name to Andeavor...\" is part of the [S4] section. Then [S5] is mentioned later. So the correct citation for that sentence would be [S4]. But I need to confirm. The user's context has:\n\n[S4] rebrands its Tesoro and 76 gas stations as HELE;\n* 2017: Tesoro announces its change of name to Andeavor following its acquisition of Western Refining; On August 1, 2017, the company changed its ticker symbol to \"ANDV\" from \"TSO\";\n[S5] ## Media controversy\n\nSo the sentence about the name change is in [S4], so the citation is [S4]. However, the user's context might have the sentence numbered as [S4] and [S5] as separate. Wait, the way the context is presented, the line with the name change is part of the [S4] chunk. So the correct citation is [S4]. \n\nTherefore, the answer should state that Tesoro changed its name to Andeavor in 2017, specifically August 1, 2017, and the ticker symbol changed from TSO to ANDV, citing [S4]."

I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for any mentions of Amazonian crude oil. The user provided a chunk of text with various sentences numbered [S1] to [S13]. Let me go through each sentence.\n\nLooking at [S11], it says: \"Defenders of the Amazon forest in South America cite Tesoro for sourcing some of their crude oil from the Amazon.\" That mentions Tesoro sourcing crude from the Amazon, but it doesn't list specific refineries. \n\nThen, in [S12], there's a sentence: \"Three of Tesoro's refineries - Anacortes (WA), LA (CA) and Golden Eagle (CA), were known to process Amazonian crude oil.\" That seems to directly answer the question. The refineries mentioned are Anacortes in Washington, LA (which I assume is Los Angeles in California), and Golden Eagle in California. \n\nI should check if there are any other references. The rest of the sentences talk about mergers, acquisitions, environmental issues, and an explosion, but nothing else about Amazonian crude. \n\nSo the answer should be those three refineries. The citation for that information is [S12]. I need to make sure there's no other sentence that mentions other refineries.
