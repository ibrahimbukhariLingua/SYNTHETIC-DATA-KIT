  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about shopping directories in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document explains what an online shopping directory is, comparing it to traditional directories and other similar services. It mentions that these directories organize ecommerce sites by category, unlike comparison shopping sites which focus on product comparisons and prices. There's also a distinction between directories and online marketplaces like Amazon. Then there's a section on variations, including coupon sites. The history part talks about how free directories like the Open Directory Project declined with the rise of Google, and now there's a push to reinvent shopping directories. The business models include listing fees, affiliate programs, and ads.\n\nSo the main points are: definition of shopping directories, differences from comparison sites and marketplaces, variations like coupon sites, historical context with the shift to search engines, and current business models. I need to condense this into a concise summary. Make sure to highlight the key concepts without getting too detailed. Check for any specific examples mentioned, but maybe just mention them briefly. Avoid jargon where possible. Ensure each sentence covers a distinct aspect. Let me try to structure it step by step.\n</think>\n\nAn online shopping directory is a categorized web platform that aggregates ecommerce sites, helping users locate online retailers by product type, distinct from comparison shopping sites (which focus on price comparisons) and marketplaces (which host third-party sellers under their brand). It evolved from traditional directories but declined with the rise of search engines like Google, which now dominate online shopping searches, though new startups aim to revitalize their relevance. Variations include coupon and deal sites, which prioritize discounts but face merchant skepticism, while business models rely on listing fees, affiliate commissions, and advertising. The document highlights the shift from directory-based shopping to search-driven commerce and ongoing efforts to adapt directories to modern ecommerce needs.",

The user is asking, \"What is an online shopping directory?\" I need to look at the supporting context provided and find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the passage. The first sentence in the chunk is [S1] \"Shopping directory\". Then there's a heading \"Shopping directory\" followed by a definition. Let me check each sentence.\n\n[S1] is just the heading, maybe not the answer. The next sentence [S2] talks about online shopping directories being \"Yellow Pages-Style\" web directories specializing in ecommerce sites. That seems like a key point. Then [S3] mentions they organize sites by category and subcategory. [S4] is a citation about physical mall constraints, but the main definition is in [S2] and [S3]. \n\nLooking at the structure, the answer should explain that an online shopping directory is a web directory similar to Yellow Pages, focusing on ecommerce sites, organizing them by categories. The citations would be [S2] and [S3]. Also, [S1] might be part of the definition, but since it's a heading, maybe not. The user might need the definition from the first paragraph. \n\nWait, the first paragraph starts with \"An online shopping directory is a 'Yellow Pages-Style' web directory...\" which is [S2]. Then [S3] adds that they organize by category. So the answer should combine these two sentences. Also, [S4] is part of the same sentence, but it's a citation for the constraints. So the main answer is in [S2] and [S3]. \n\nI need to make sure the statement is accurate. The answer is in [S2] and [S3], so the citations would be [S2][S3]. Let me check if there's more.

Then, sentence [S2] says they're inspired by traditional shopping mall directories but organize sites by category. But the key difference might be in sentence [S3], which talks about not having constraints like distance, location, hours, etc. So online directories aggregate all ecommerce sites in one place, unlike physical malls which are limited by location.\n\nAlso, the passage compares shopping directories to comparison shopping sites and marketplaces. But the question is about physical mall directories. The answer should focus on the differences in structure and constraints. The physical mall directories are probably limited to the mall's physical stores, while online ones are centralized and not restricted by physical factors. The citation for this would be [S3]. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other sentences that mention physical mall directories. Sentence [S2] mentions traditional shopping mall directories as inspiration, but the actual difference is in [S3]. So the answer should state that online directories aren't constrained by physical factors and aggregate all ecommerce sites, citing [S3]. Also, maybe mention that they organize by category, but the main difference is the lack of physical constraints. Wait, the question is about how they differ, so the main points are the absence of physical constraints and centralized aggregation. So the answer would be based on [S3], and maybe [S2] for the organizational structure. But the user is asking for differences, so the key is [S3]. Let me check again. The passage says online directories \"serve to aggregate all ecommerce sites in one centralized location\" which physical malls can't do. So the answer is in [S3].

That's a definition, but maybe not the primary purpose. \n\nLooking at sentence [S3], it says that online shopping directories serve to aggregate all ecommerce sites in one centralized location to help users decide where to shop online. That sounds like a primary purpose. The mention of \"aggregate... in one centralized location\" and \"help a user decide where to shop\" seems to align with the question.\n\nAnother part is in [S1], which just mentions \"Shopping directory\" but no details. [S2] talks about organizing by category and subcategory, which is a method, not the purpose. [S4] is about constraints like distance and location, which are reasons why the directory is useful, but the main purpose is still in [S3].\n\nI should check if there are other sentences that might contribute.

I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of Google and changes in shopping behavior. The section under \"History\" seems promising. Let me check each sentence there.\n\nLooking at [S14], it talks about free directories losing prominence before Google's popularity. Then [S15] mentions that shopping directories like Yahoo! or PayPal played a role in users' habits before Google. [S16] states that as Google gained dominance, users adapted their shopping search behavior. That seems directly relevant. \n\nAlso, [S17] says most search engines took over the role of shopping directories. And [S18] mentions criticisms of using search engines like Google for ecommerce. But the key point here is the adaptation of user behavior when Google became dominant. \n\nSo the main points are that before Google, directories were important, but as Google rose, users shifted to using search engines, changing their shopping search habits. The citations needed would be [S16] and maybe [S17] and [S15]. Wait, the question is specifically about the change in behavior, so [S16] is the direct answer. [S15] provides context about the previous role of directories. \n\nI should structure the answer to mention that users adapted their behavior as Google dominated, moving from directories to search engines. The citations would be [S15] and [S16]. Let me check if there's more. [S17] says search engines took over the role, which supports the change. So maybe include that too. \n\nSo the answer would be: Users' shopping behavior shifted from relying on shopping directories to using search engines like Google, as Google's dominance led to changes in how they searched for products. Citations would be [S15][S16][S17]. Wait, but the question is about the change, so the key sentence is [S16], with [S15] and [S17] as supporting. Let me make sure each part is correctly cited."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for one business model for shopping directories. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage. The section titled \"Business model\" is probably where the answer lies. Let me check that part. \n\nLooking at the chunk provided, under the \"Business model\" section, there are bullet points listed. The first bullet says: \"Charging a one-time and/or recurring listing fee to the ecommerce site.\" That sounds like a business model. The second bullet mentions affiliate programs and earning commissions. The third talks about advertising, like banner ads or sponsored listings. The fourth is a combination of the above.\n\nThe question is asking for one business model, so any of these points would work. The user probably wants the most straightforward answer. The first point is a clear example. I need to make sure there's a citation for that sentence. \n\nLooking at the sentence numbers, the \"Business model\" section starts at [S22]. But the bullets are part of the same chunk. Wait, the original context's \"Business model\" section is part of the chunk provided. Let me check the exact numbering. \n\nIn the supporting context, the \"Business model\" section is under the chunk, and the bullets are part of that. However, the sentence numbers might not be explicitly listed for each bullet. Wait, the user provided the chunk with sentence numbers. Let me check again.\n\nThe chunk starts with [S1] Shopping directory, then [S2], [S3], etc. The \"Business model\" section is part of the chunk. Let me look through the sentences. \n\nLooking at the sentences, the \"Business model\" section is mentioned in [S22], but the actual bullet points are part of the same chunk. However, the way the context is structured, each sentence is numbered. The bullets under \"Business model\" are likely part of the same sentence or separate. Wait, the original context's \"Business model\" section is written as:\n\n## Business model\n\n* Charging a one-time and/or recurring listing fee to the ecommerce site\n* Use of affiliate programs of the listed ecommerce sites to earn commissions on referrals\n* Advertising in the directory itself, such as banner ads, contextual ads like Google AdSense or some form of sponsored listings (usually pay per click based)\n* Combination of above\n\nBut in the chunk provided, each of these bullets might be considered separate sentences. However, the original sentence numbers in the chunk don't explicitly mark these bullets. Wait, the user's supporting context has sentence numbers like [S1], [S2], etc., but the \"Business model\" section's bullets are part of the chunk. Let me check the exact sentences.\n\nLooking at the chunk again:\n\nAfter the \"History\" section, the next part is:\n\n## Business model\n\n* Charging a one-time and/or recurring listing fee to the ecommerce site\n* Use of affiliate programs of the listed ecommerce sites to earn commissions on referrals\n* Advertising in the directory itself, such as banner ads, contextual ads like Google AdSense or some form of sponsored listings (usually pay per click based)\n* Combination of above\n\nBut in the original chunk, the sentence numbers go up to [S22]. The \"Business model\" section is part of the chunk, but the bullets might not have their own sentence numbers. Wait, the user's provided chunk includes the \"Business model\" section, but the sentence numbers are assigned to each sentence. However, the bullets are not separated into individual sentences. This is a bit confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each bullet is considered a separate sentence. But the original context's structure might not have sentence numbers for each bullet. The user's supporting context might have the \"Business model\" section as part of the chunk, but the sentence numbers are assigned to the paragraphs. \n\nWait, looking at the original chunk provided by the user:\n\nThe \"Business model\" section is part of the chunk, and the sentences are numbered up to [S22]. The \"Business model\" section is likely [S22], but the bullets are part of that sentence. However, the way the user presented the chunk, the \"Business model\" section is written as a list, but the sentence numbers might not be assigned to each bullet. \n\nThis is a bit unclear. However, the user's instruction says that each sentence is inside <statement> tags with citations. So, if the \"Business model\" section's bullets are part of the same sentence, then the citation would be [S22]. But if each bullet is a separate sentence, then each would have their own citation. \n\nBut in the original chunk provided, the \"Business model\" section is written as a list, and the sentence numbers might not be assigned to each bullet. Therefore, the entire \"Business model\" section is part of [S22], and the bullets are part of that sentence. However, the user's example shows that each sentence is a separate <statement> with its own citations. \n\nGiven that, perhaps each bullet is considered a separate sentence. But the original context's sentence numbers don't explicitly mark them. This is a problem. However, the user's supporting context might have the \"Business model\" section as a single sentence [S22], and the bullets are part of that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's chunk has the \"Business model\" section as part of the text, and the sentence numbers are assigned to each paragraph. For example, the \"Business model\" section might be [S22], and the bullets are part of that. \n\nIn that case, the answer would be that one business model is charging a listing fee, cited from [S22]. However, the user's example shows that each sentence is a separate statement. \n\nBut given the ambiguity, the safest approach is to check the original context's sentence numbers. The user's chunk ends with:\n\n[S22] ## Business model\n\n* Charging a one-time and/or recurring listing fee to the ecommerce site\n* Use of affiliate programs of the listed ecommerce sites to earn commissions on referrals\n* Advertising in the directory itself, such as banner ads, contextual ads like Google AdSense or some form of sponsored listings (usually pay per click based)\n* Combination of above\n\nWait, no, looking back, the original chunk provided by the user has:\n\nAfter the \"History\" section, the next part is:\n\n## Business model\n\n* Charging a one-time and/or recurring listing fee to the ecommerce site\n* Use of affiliate programs of the listed ecommerce sites to earn commissions on referrals\n* Advertising in the directory itself, such as banner ads, contextual ads like Google AdSense or some form of sponsored listings (usually pay per click based)\n* Combination of above\n\nBut in the user's provided chunk, the sentence numbers go up to [S22], which is the \"Business model\" section. However, the actual bullets are not numbered. Therefore, the entire \"Business model\" section is [S22], and the bullets are part of that sentence. \n\nTherefore, when the user asks for a business model, the answer would be one of the bullets, cited from [S22]. However, the user's instructions require that each sentence is in <statement> tags with citations. So, if the bullets are considered separate sentences, they would each have their own citations. But since the original context doesn't have sentence numbers for each bullet, perhaps the entire \"Business model\" section is considered one sentence [S22], and the answer is that one business model is charging a listing fee, cited from [S22]. \n\nAlternatively, if the bullets are considered separate sentences, but the original context doesn't assign them numbers, then the citations might not be available. However, the user's example shows that the citations are based on the provided sentence numbers. \n\nGiven that, the answer would be:\n\n<statement>One business model for shopping directories is charging a one-time and/or recurring listing fee to the ecommerce site.<cite>[S22]</cite></statement>\n\nBut I need to confirm if [S22] is the correct citation. Looking back, the \"Business model\" section is part of the chunk, and the sentence numbers go up to [S22]. So yes, [S22] would be the citation for the entire section, including the bullets. Therefore, the answer is correct with [S22]."

      "question": "What advertising methods do shopping directories use?",
      "answer": "<statement>Shopping directories use advertising methods such as banner ads, contextual ads like Google AdSense, and sponsored listings (usually pay per click based).<cite>[S22]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the advertising methods that shopping directories use. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for any mentions of advertising. The section titled \"Business model\" seems promising. Let me check there. \n\nLooking at the bullet points under \"Business model,\" the third point says: \"Advertising in the directory itself, such as banner ads, contextual ads like Google AdSense or some form of sponsored listings (usually pay per click based).\" That definitely lists advertising methods. The citation here is [S22], but wait, the bullet points are part of the Business model section. Let me check the actual sentences. \n\nWait, the user provided the supporting context with sentence numbers. The Business model section is part of the chunk. Let me check the exact sentences. \n\nIn the supporting context, the Business model is listed with bullet points. The third bullet point is: \"Advertising in the directory itself, such as banner ads, contextual ads like Google AdSense or some form of sponsored listings (usually pay per click based)\" and the citation for that is [S22]. \n\nSo the answer would be that shopping directories use banner ads, contextual ads (like Google AdSense), and sponsored listings (pay per click). The citation is [S22]. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other mentions of advertising methods elsewhere. Let me check other parts. The rest of the passage talks about differences between directories, marketplaces, coupon sites, history, etc., but nothing else about advertising methods. \n\nTherefore, the answer is based on the third bullet point in the Business model section, cited as [S22]."

      "chunk": "Chunk:\n\n[S1] Shopping directory\n\n\n# Shopping directory\n\n\n\nAn online **shopping directory** is a \"Yellow Pages-Style\" web directory that specializes in ecommerce sites (which are websites that sell products or services). [S2] Inspired by the organizational structure used in traditional shopping mall directories, online shopping directories organize ecommerce sites by their category and subcategory of goods sold. [S3] Without the constraints related to shopping at a physical mall (e.g. [S4] distance, location, hours of operation, access to transportation), an online shopping directory serves to aggregate all ecommerce sites in one centralized location in order to help a user decide where to shop online. [S5] ## Variations\n\nA shopping directory is different from a comparison shopping website (which is also referred to as a comparison shopping engine or a price comparison shopping site). [S6] While comparison shopping websites present product listings, by category, so a user can compare pricing on same and/or similar products, a shopping directory does not provide product comparison, review or sale. [S7] Examples of comparison shopping websites include: Google Shopping, Shopping.com, Shopzilla, TheFind.com\n\nA shopping directory is different from an online marketplace. [S8] Marketplaces sell products and/or services that are aggregated from various ecommerce sellers but sold under the branding and infrastructure of the named marketplace itself. [S9] Examples of online marketplaces include: Amazon, Etsy and eBay. [S10] A specialized form of a shopping directory is a coupon, daily deal and/or promotional savings site. [S11] Coupon sites provide a niche web directory centered on deal aggregation by listing only ecommerce sites that offer additional savings to the user. [S12] Coupon sites are very popular with users but often are viewed negatively by merchants. [S13] Examples of coupon sites include: Retailmenot, Coupons.com, Groupon\n\n\n## History\n\nFree directories such as the Open Directory Project, often updated by volunteers, lost their prominence and relevancy in today's search-driven internet. [S14] Before the increased popularity of the Google search engine, shopping directories, such as that found at the Yahoo! [S15] Directory or the PayPal Shopping Directory, played a prominent role in users' online shopping habits and behavior. [S16] As Google gained dominance, users adapted their shopping search behavior to the new system. [S17] Most search engines took over the role traditionally filled by shopping directories. [S18] Recently, criticisms have emerged over the limits of using search engines such as Google and Bing for use in the ecommerce cycle. [S19] The dominance of the SEO structure in search makes competition fierce among merchants as they struggle for positioning on the Google search results pages. [S20] New methodologies for shopping directories are emerging as startups look to bridge the gap between ecommerce and search. [S21] As ecommerce continues to grow, startup companies are reinvisioning the shopping directory to make it more relevant to the growing needs of online shoppers. [S22] ## Business model\n\n* Charging a one-time and/or recurring listing fee to the ecommerce site\n* Use of affiliate programs of the listed ecommerce sites to earn commissions on referrals\n* Advertising in the directory itself, such as banner ads, contextual ads like Google AdSense or some form of sponsored listings (usually pay per click based)\n* Combination of above",
      "question": "Why are startups focusing on shopping directories?",
      "answer": "<statement>Startups are focusing on shopping directories to bridge the gap between ecommerce and search, as new methodologies are emerging to address limitations in current search engine structures.<cite>[S20]</cite></statement> <statement>Additionally, startups are reinventing shopping directories to meet the growing needs of online shoppers as ecommerce continues to expand.<cite>[S21]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking why startups are focusing on shopping directories. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of startups. There's a sentence that says, \"New methodologies for shopping directories are emerging as startups look to bridge the gap between ecommerce and search.\" That seems directly related. Another sentence mentions, \"As ecommerce continues to grow, startup companies are reinvisioning the shopping directory to make it more relevant to the growing needs of online shoppers.\" Both of these sentences point to startups focusing on shopping directories to address gaps and meet growing needs.\n\nI should check if there are other parts that might contribute. The history section talks about how search engines took over from shopping directories, leading to criticisms. Then, the part about startups emerging with new methods to bridge the gap. Also, the business model section lists various revenue strategies, but the question is about why startups are focusing on it, not how they make money.\n\nSo the key reasons from the context are: bridging the gap between ecommerce and search, reinventing directories to meet growing needs, and addressing limitations of current search engines. The citations would be [S20] and [S21], and [S22]. Wait, let me check the exact sentences again.\n\nThe first relevant sentence is [S20]: \"New methodologies for shopping directories are emerging as startups look to bridge the gap between ecommerce and search.\" Then [S21]: \"As ecommerce continues to grow, startup companies are reinvisioning the shopping directory to make it more relevant to the growing needs of online shoppers.\" So those two sentences. \n\nAre there any other sentences? The user might need the answer to be based on these. So the answer would combine these points, citing those sentences. I need to make sure each statement is in <statement> tags with the correct citations."
