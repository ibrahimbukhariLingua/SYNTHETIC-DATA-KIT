  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document on the Shapiro\u2013Stiglitz theory in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document introduces the Shapiro\u2013Stiglitz theory, which explains why wages don't fall even during unemployment and how involuntary unemployment arises. The key idea is that firms pay higher wages to prevent workers from shirking, leading to downward wage rigidity. The no-shirking condition (NSC) is crucial here, where workers must be paid enough to not shirk, which ties into the equilibrium where unemployment acts as a discipline mechanism.\n\nThen there's the market equilibrium part, where the model shows that if wages are too low, workers shirk, reducing productivity. This creates a situation where wages can't drop below a certain level, causing unemployment. The theory also touches on job security rules and how they affect employment levels. Finally, there's a section on trade liberalization, where the model is extended to show how trade affects firms and workers, leading to job losses in certain regions.\n\nI need to make sure I capture the main points: the theory's explanation of efficiency wages, the NSC, wage rigidity, involuntary unemployment, and the impact of trade. I should avoid the technical equations and focus on the concepts. Let me structure this into a concise summary.\n</think>\n\nThe Shapiro\u2013Stiglitz theory explains why wages remain rigid and involuntary unemployment persists in labor markets by emphasizing the role of **efficiency wages**. Firms pay above-market wages to deter worker shirking, as lower wages would incentivize reduced effort, lowering productivity. This creates a **no-shirking condition (NSC)**, where workers must be compensated sufficiently to maintain effort, leading to downward wage rigidity and higher unemployment as a disciplinary mechanism. The model highlights that involuntary unemployment arises because workers cannot credibly commit to hard work at lower wages, and firms avoid cutting wages to prevent shirking. Additionally, the theory extends to analyze how job security rules and trade liberalization affect employment, showing that stricter dismissal policies reduce employment and that trade can destroy high-paying jobs in certain sectors.",

[S2] It provides a technical description of why wages are unlikely to fall and how involuntary unemployment appears. [S3] This theory was first developed by Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz. [S4] ## Introduction\n\nWhen full employment is achieved, if a worker is sacked, he automatically finds his next job soon. [S5] In the circumstances, he does not need to exert his effort in his job, and thus full employment necessarily motivates a worker to shirk provided that he is happy with loafing on the job. [S6] Since shirking makes a firm's productivity decline, the firm needs to offer its workers higher wages to eliminate shirking. [S7] Then all firms try to eliminate shirking, which pushes up average wages and decreases employment. [S8] Hence nominal wages tend to display downward rigidity. [S9] In equilibrium, all firms pay the same wage above market clearing, and unemployment makes job loss costly, and so unemployment serves as a worker-discipline device. [S10] A jobless person cannot convince an employer that he works at a wage lower than the equilibrium wage, because the owner worries that shirking occurs after he is hired. [S11] As a result, his unemployment becomes involuntary. [S12] ## No-shirking condition\n\nSuppose utility is a function of wages w and effort e like {\\displaystyle u(w,e)=w-e}, and workers maximize the utility function with a discount rate r. [S13] Then let b be the probability per unit time that a worker is dismissed from his job, and now we introduce the expected lifetime utility {\\displaystyle V\\_{u}} of an unemployed individual. [S14] Then we find the asset value of employment during a short interval [0, T]\n\nbecause the worker is either dismissed or kept employed during the time. [S15] The exponential function appears, because the occasion of dismiss in the interval is once and Poisson distribution is used for the discount rate. [S16] Due to the short interval, we approximate the exponential function by 1-rT\n\nand simple calculation yields\n\nThen we find the fundamental asset equation of a worker:\n\nFor a nonshirker the equation is\n\nand for a shirker\n\nwhere q is the probability per unit time that a worker is caught shirking and sacked. [S17] Then we see\n\nThe condition {\\displaystyle V\\_{e,S}<V\\_{e,N}} is called the no-shirking condition (NSC), which is expressed as\n\nwhere {\\displaystyle {\\hat {w}}} is the critical wage. [S18] The worker works hard if and only if the NSC is satisfied. [S19] Thus if workers get sufficiently high wages, then the NSC is met and they will not shirk. [S20] The condition tells us that\n\n* As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the workers exert more effort. [S21] * As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the expected lifetime utility of an unemployed individual increases. [S22] * As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the probability of being detected shirking decreases. [S23] * As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the discount rate increases. [S24] * As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the exogenous separation rate increases. [S25] ## Market equilibrium\n\nLet {\\displaystyle a} be the probability of getting a job per unit time. [S26] In equilibrium, the flow into the unemployment pool must be equal to the flow out. [S27] Thus the probability is\n\nwhere {\\displaystyle L} is the aggregate employment and {\\displaystyle N} is the total labour supply. [S28] In reality, an employee is offered his minimum wage {\\displaystyle {\\overline {w}}} or its equivalent by law. [S29] Thus the NSC becomes\n\nand we call it the aggregate NSC. [S30] These two yields\n\nwhere the unemployment rate is {\\displaystyle u={\\frac {N-L}{N}}}. [S31] This constraint suggests that full employment always should involve shirking.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking, \"What factors influence the critical wage according to the theory?\" So I need to look through the provided supporting context and find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the passage. The key part here is probably the section about the No-shirking condition (NSC) and the critical wage. Let me check the sentences related to that. \n\nLooking at the chunk, there's a section starting with \"The condition V_e,S < V_e,N is called the no-shirking condition (NSC)...\". Then it mentions that the critical wage is denoted by \u0175. The next sentences list several points about how the critical wage is influenced. Specifically, in sentences S21 to S25, there are bullet points indicating factors. \n\nFor example, S21 says \"As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the workers exert more effort.\" But wait, the question is about factors that influence the critical wage, not the effects of the critical wage. So maybe I need to look for what determines the critical wage. \n\nWait, the NSC equation is given as V_e,S < V_e,N, which leads to the critical wage. The factors affecting the critical wage would be the variables in the NSC equation. Let me check the equations mentioned. \n\nIn the equations, there's a mention of the discount rate r, the probability of being dismissed (b), the probability of being caught shirking (q), and other parameters. The critical wage \u0175 is determined by these variables. \n\nLooking at the sentences again, S18 mentions the critical wage \u0175. Then the bullet points in the text (which are in S21-S25) might be the effects of the critical wage, but maybe the factors influencing it are the variables in the NSC condition. \n\nWait, the user is asking for factors that influence the critical wage. So the critical wage itself is determined by the parameters in the model. The NSC equation would have variables like the discount rate, the probability of being caught shirking, the separation rate, etc. \n\nBut in the given passage, the specific factors are listed in the bullet points. Let me check the exact sentences. \n\nThe bullet points under the NSC section say:\n\n- As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the workers exert more effort. (S21)\n- As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the expected lifetime utility of an unemployed individual increases. (S22)\n- As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the probability of being detected shirking decreases. (S23)\n- As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the discount rate increases. (S24)\n- As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the exogenous separation rate increases. (S25)\n\nWait, these points are about the effects of the critical wage, not the factors that influence it. So maybe the actual factors are the variables that affect the critical wage. For example, the discount rate (r), the probability of being dismissed (b), the probability of being caught shirking (q), etc. \n\nBut the passage doesn't explicitly list these factors. However, the NSC equation would involve these variables. The critical wage is determined by the condition that the worker's utility from not shirking is higher than from shirking. So the factors would be the parameters in that equation. \n\nBut the user's question is about what factors influence the critical wage according to the theory. The passage might not explicitly list them, but the NSC equation's components would be the factors. However, in the given context, the only direct mentions are the bullet points, which are about the effects of the critical wage. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the factors are the ones that affect the no-shirking condition. For example, the discount rate, the probability of being caught shirking, the separation rate, etc. But the passage doesn't explicitly state this. \n\nWait, looking back at the sentences, S13 mentions utility as a function of wages and effort, with a discount rate r. S14 talks about the expected lifetime utility of an unemployed individual. S15 mentions the exponential function and Poisson distribution. S16 explains the approximation. Then the equations for the asset value of employment. \n\nThe critical wage is derived from the NSC condition, which involves these variables. However, the passage doesn't explicitly list the factors that influence the critical wage. The bullet points (S21-S25) are about the consequences of the critical wage, not the factors that determine it. \n\nBut the user is asking for factors that influence the critical wage. If the passage doesn't explicitly state them, maybe the answer is that the critical wage is influenced by the discount rate, the probability of being caught shirking, the separation rate, and other parameters in the NSC equation. However, since the passage doesn't list these explicitly, perhaps the answer is based on the bullet points, but that seems off. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that the critical wage is influenced by the factors mentioned in the NSC condition, which include the discount rate, the probability of dismissal, the probability of being caught shirking, etc. But since the passage doesn't explicitly state this, I need to check again. \n\nWait, the user's question is about factors that influence the critical wage. The passage's S18 mentions the critical wage \u0175. The bullet points (S21-S25) are about the effects of the critical wage. However, the actual factors that determine the critical wage would be the parameters in the NSC equation. For example, the discount rate (r), the probability of being dismissed (b), the probability of being caught shirking (q), and the exogenous separation rate. \n\nBut the passage doesn't explicitly list these factors. However, in the equations, the critical wage is determined by these variables. Since the user is asking according to the theory, and the theory is presented in the passage, the answer would be that the critical wage is influenced by the discount rate, the probability of being caught shirking, the exogenous separation rate, and other parameters in the NSC condition. \n\nBut since the passage doesn't explicitly list these, maybe the answer is inferred from the NSC equation. However, the user's context might not have that. Alternatively, the answer might be that the critical wage is influenced by the factors mentioned in the bullet points, but that's the other way around. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me recheck the passage. \n\nIn the NSC condition, the critical wage is determined by the equation V_e,S < V_e,N. The variables involved in this equation would include the discount rate (r), the probability of being dismissed (b), the probability of being caught shirking (q), and the utility function parameters. \n\nBut the passage doesn't explicitly state these factors. However, the user's question is about factors influencing the critical wage according to the theory. Since the theory is the Shapiro\u2013Stiglitz model, the factors would be the parameters in the NSC condition. \n\nBut since the passage doesn't list them, perhaps the answer is that the critical wage is influenced by the discount rate, the probability of being caught shirking, the exogenous separation rate, and the expected lifetime utility of the unemployed. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be that the critical wage is influenced by the factors that affect the no-shirking condition, which include the discount rate, the probability of dismissal, and the probability of being caught shirking. \n\nBut without explicit citations, I need to rely on the given sentences. The only direct mentions are the bullet points, which are about the effects of the critical wage. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is that the critical wage is influenced by the discount rate, the probability of being caught shirking, and the exogenous separation rate, as these are parameters in the NSC equation. However, since the passage doesn't explicitly state this, I might need to infer based on the equations. \n\nBut given the user's context, the answer should be based on the provided sentences. Since the bullet points (S21-S25) are about the effects of the critical wage, not the factors influencing it, perhaps the answer is that the critical wage is determined by the parameters in the NSC condition, which include the discount rate, the probability of being caught shirking, and the exogenous separation rate. \n\nBut since the passage doesn't explicitly list these, I might have to state that the factors are the ones mentioned in the NSC equation, which are not directly listed here. However, the user's question requires citations from the provided context. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that the critical wage is influenced by the discount rate, the probability of being caught shirking, and the exogenous separation rate, as these are part of the NSC condition. But without explicit citations, I can't cite specific sentences. \n\nWait, looking back, the NSC equation is derived from the utility functions and the probabilities. The sentences S13-S17 discuss these variables. For example, S13 mentions the discount rate r, S14 talks about the probability of dismissal (b), S17 mentions the probability of being caught shirking (q). \n\nSo the factors influencing the critical wage would be the discount rate (r), the probability of dismissal (b), the probability of being caught shirking (q), and the exogenous separation rate. \n\nBut the passage doesn't explicitly state that these factors influence the critical wage. However, since the critical wage is determined by the NSC condition, which involves these variables, they are the factors. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the critical wage is influenced by the discount rate, the probability of being caught shirking, the exogenous separation rate, and other parameters in the NSC condition. But since the user wants citations, I need to check if any sentences mention these factors. \n\nLooking at the sentences:\n\nS13: mentions discount rate r.\nS14: probability of dismissal (b).\nS17: probability of being caught shirking (q).\nS25: exogenous separation rate.\n\nSo the factors are mentioned in these sentences. Therefore, the answer would be that the critical wage is influenced by the discount rate (S13), the probability of dismissal (S14), the probability of being caught shirking (S17), and the exogenous separation rate (S25). \n\nBut the question is about factors that influence the critical wage, so these variables are the factors. Therefore, the answer should list these factors with their respective citations."
