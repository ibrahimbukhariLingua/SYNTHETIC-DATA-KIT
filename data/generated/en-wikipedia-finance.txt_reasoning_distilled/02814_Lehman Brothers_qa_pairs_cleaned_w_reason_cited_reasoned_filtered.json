  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Lehman Brothers in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the document to understand the main points.\n\nThe document starts by introducing Lehman Brothers as a major financial firm that existed from 1850 to 2008. It mentions their role in the 2008 financial crisis, their bankruptcy, and the impact of that. The key events include their involvement in the subprime mortgage crisis, the use of risky financial practices, and the collapse leading to the largest bankruptcy in US history. There's also information about the aftermath, like the sale of parts of the company to Barclays and Nomura, and the legal and financial fallout.\n\nI should focus on the main topic: the collapse of Lehman Brothers and its significance. Key concepts include the subprime mortgage crisis, the bankruptcy, the \"too big to fail\" doctrine, and the global financial impact. Also, the history from its founding to the 2008 collapse, the causes like risky investments and accounting practices, and the aftermath with the sale of assets and legal issues.\n\nI need to make sure the summary is concise, hits the main points, and doesn't get bogged down in details. Let me check if I have all the essential elements: what Lehman Brothers was, why they collapsed, the consequences, and the aftermath. Avoid specific dates and numbers unless they're crucial. Make sure to mention the role in the 2008 crisis and the bankruptcy's impact on the financial system.\n</think>\n\nLehman Brothers, a prominent American investment bank founded in 1850, collapsed in 2008 due to its heavy exposure to risky subprime mortgage investments and complex financial practices, becoming the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. Its failure exacerbated the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis, triggering global market turmoil and reinforcing the \"too big to fail\" doctrine. The collapse stemmed from speculative lending, leveraged assets, and controversial accounting tactics, leading to the sale of its remaining divisions to Barclays and Nomura. The aftermath included extensive litigation, regulatory reforms, and a lasting impact on financial stability, marking a pivotal moment in modern economic history.",

      "chunk": "Chunk:\n\n[S1] Lehman Brothers\n\n\n# Lehman Brothers\n\n\n\n**Lehman Brothers Inc.** (/\u02c8li\u02d0m\u0259n/ LEE-m\u0259n) was an American global financial services firm founded in 1850. [S2] Before filing for bankruptcy in 2008, Lehman was the fourth-largest investment bank in the United States (behind Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch), with about 25,000 employees worldwide. [S3] It was doing business in investment banking, equity, fixed-income and derivatives sales and trading (especially U.S. [S4] Treasury securities), research, investment management, private equity, and private banking. [S5] Lehman was operational for 158 years from its founding in 1850 until 2008. [S6] On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following the exodus of most of its clients, drastic declines in its stock price, and the devaluation of assets by credit rating agencies. [S7] The collapse was largely due to Lehman's involvement in the subprime mortgage crisis and its exposure to less liquid assets. [S8] Lehman's bankruptcy filing is the largest in US history, having beaten the previous record holder Worldcom, Inc., and is thought to have played a major role in the unfolding of the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis. [S9] The market collapse also gave support to the \"too big to fail\" doctrine. [S10] After Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, global markets immediately plummeted. [S11] The following day, major British bank Barclays announced its agreement to purchase, subject to regulatory approval, a significant and controlling interest in Lehman's North American investment-banking and trading divisions, along with its New York headquarters building. [S12] On September 20, 2008, a revised version of that agreement was approved by U.S. [S13] Bankruptcy Court Judge James M. [S14] Peck. [S15] The next week, Nomura Holdings announced that it would acquire Lehman Brothers' franchise in the Asia\u2013Pacific region, including Japan, Hong Kong and Australia, as well as Lehman Brothers' investment banking and equities businesses in Europe and the Middle East. [S16] The deal became effective on October 13, 2008. [S17] ## History\n\n\n### Under the Lehman family (1850\u20131969)\n\nIn 1844, 23-year-old Hayum Lehmann, who changed his name to Henry Lehman, the son of a Jewish cattle merchant, emigrated to the United States from Rimpar, Bavaria. [S18] He settled in Montgomery, Alabama, where he opened a dry-goods store, \"H. [S19] Lehman\". [S20] In 1847, following the arrival of his brother Emanuel Lehman, the firm became \"H. [S21] Lehman and Bro.\" With the arrival of their youngest brother, Mayer Lehman, in 1850, the firm changed its name again and \"Lehman Brothers\" was founded. [S22] During the 1850s, cotton was one of the most important crops in the United States, and was Alabama's highest-grossing cash crop. [S23] Until the U.S. [S24] Civil War, nearly all U.S. [S25] cotton was produced by slave labor, and by the 1860 census, slaves constituted nearly 45% of Alabama's total population. [S26] Mayer Lehman was listed as the owner of seven slaves (\"three males and four females ranging in age from 5 to 50\") in the U.S. [S27] Census of 1860. [S28] Capitalizing on cotton's high market value, the three brothers began to routinely accept raw cotton from slave plantations as payment for merchandise, eventually beginning a second business trading in cotton. [S29] Within a few years this business grew to become the most significant part of their operation. [S30] Following Henry's death from yellow fever in 1855, the remaining brothers continued to focus on their commodities-trading/brokerage operations.",
      "question": "What was the primary cause of Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in 2008?",
      "answer": "<statement>The primary cause of Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in 2008 was its involvement in the subprime mortgage crisis and exposure to less liquid assets.<cite>[S7]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the primary cause of Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in 2008. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for sentences that mention the causes. Sentence S7 says, \"The collapse was largely due to Lehman's involvement in the subprime mortgage crisis and its exposure to less liquid assets.\" That seems like a key point. Another sentence, S8, mentions \"Lehman's bankruptcy filing is the largest in US history... due to the subprime mortgage crisis.\" Wait, actually, looking back, S7 is the one that specifically states the cause. \n\nI should check if there are other sentences that might contribute. S6 mentions the reasons for filing bankruptcy: exodus of clients, stock price decline, and asset devaluation. But those are more like immediate triggers rather than the primary cause. The primary cause would be the underlying issue, which is the subprime mortgage crisis and exposure to illiquid assets. \n\nSo the answer should reference S7. Let me make sure there's no other conflicting information. The other sentences talk about the aftermath or historical context, not the main cause. Therefore, the primary cause is the subprime mortgage crisis and exposure to less liquid assets, as stated in S7."

[S2] Within a few years this business grew to become the most significant part of their operation. [S3] Following Henry's death from yellow fever in 1855, the remaining brothers continued to focus on their commodities-trading/brokerage operations. [S4] By 1858, the center of cotton trading had shifted from the South to New York City, where factors and commission houses were based. [S5] Lehman opened its first branch office at 119 Liberty Street, and 32-year-old Emanuel relocated there to run the office. [S6] In 1862, facing difficulties as a result of the Civil War, the firm teamed up with a cotton merchant named John Durr to form Lehman, Durr & Co. [S7] Following the war the company helped finance Alabama's reconstruction. [S8] The firm's headquarters was eventually moved to New York City, where it helped found the New York Cotton Exchange in 1870, commodifying the crop; Emanuel sat on the board of governors until 1884. [S9] The firm also dealt in the emerging market for railroad bonds and entered the financial-advisory business. [S10] Lehman became a member of the Coffee Exchange as early as 1883 and finally the New York Stock Exchange in 1887. [S11] In 1899, it underwrote its first public offering, the preferred and common stock of the International Steam Pump Company. [S12] Despite the offering of International Steam, the firm's real shift from being a commodities house to a house of issue did not begin until 1906. [S13] In that year, under Emanuel's son Philip Lehman, the firm partnered with Goldman, Sachs & Co., to bring the General Cigar Co. [S14] to market, followed closely by Sears, Roebuck and Company. [S15] Among these were F.W. [S16] Woolworth Company, May Department Stores Company, Gimbel Brothers, Inc., R.H. [S17] Macy & Company, The Studebaker Corporation, the B.F. [S18] Goodrich Co., and Endicott Johnson Corporation. [S19] Following Philip Lehman's retirement in 1925, his son Robert \"Bobbie\" Lehman took over as head of the firm. [S20] During Bobbie's tenure, the company weathered the capital crisis of the Great Depression by focusing on venture capital while the equities market recovered. [S21] In 1924, John M. [S22] Hancock became the first non-family member to join the firm, followed by Monroe C. [S23] Gutman and Paul Mazur, who became partners in 1927. [S24] By 1928, the firm had moved to its One William Street location. [S25] In the 1930s, Lehman underwrote the initial public offering of the first television manufacturer, DuMont Laboratories, and helped fund the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). [S26] It also helped finance the rapidly growing oil industry, including the companies Halliburton and Kerr-McGee. [S27] In the 1950s, Lehman underwrote the IPO of Digital Equipment Corporation. [S28] Later, it arranged the acquisition of Digital by Compaq. [S29] ### An evolving partnership (1969\u20131984)\n\nRobert Lehman died in 1969 after 44 years in a leadership position for the firm, leaving no member of the Lehman family actively involved with the partnership. [S30] At the same time, Lehman was facing strong headwinds amidst the difficult economic environment of the early 1970s. [S31] By 1972, the firm was facing hard times and in 1973, Pete Peterson, chairman and chief executive officer of the Bell & Howell Corporation, was brought in to save the firm. [S32] Under Peterson's leadership as chairman and CEO, the firm acquired Abraham & Co. [S33] in 1975, and two years later merged with Kuhn, Loeb & Co., to form Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc., the country's fourth-largest investment bank, behind Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs and First Boston. [S34] Peterson led the firm from significant operating losses to five consecutive years of record profits with a return on equity among the highest in the investment-banking industry.",

Yes, S12 states that the real shift started in 1906. \n\nOther sentences mention partnerships and underwriting, like S13 and S14 about the General Cigar Co. and Sears, Roebuck in 1906. But the key sentence here is S12, which explicitly mentions the shift beginning in 1906. \n\nI should make sure there's no other conflicting information. The rest of the context talks about later events, like the 1920s, 1930s, etc., but the specific answer is in S12. So the answer is 1906, cited from S12."

Then S33 says under Peterson's leadership, the firm acquired Abraham & Co. in 1975. Then S34 states that two years after that (so 1977?), they merged with Kuhn, Loeb & Co. to form Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc. \n\nWait, the question is about a merger in the 1970s.

[S3] Peterson led the firm from significant operating losses to five consecutive years of record profits with a return on equity among the highest in the investment-banking industry. [S4] By the early 1980s, hostilities between the firm's investment bankers and traders prompted Peterson to promote Lewis Glucksman, the firm's President, COO and former trader, to be his co-CEO in May 1983. [S5] Glucksman introduced a number of changes that had the effect of increasing tensions, which when coupled with Glucksman's management style and a downturn in the markets, resulted in a power struggle that ousted Peterson and left Glucksman as the sole CEO. [S6] Upset bankers, who had soured over the power struggle, left the company. [S7] Stephen A.

But the question specifically asks about the outcome of the 1984 merger, so the key points are the acquisition by Shearson/American Express and the formation of the combined entity. \n\nCitations needed are S9 and S10. Let me make sure there's no other info. The rest of the context talks about later events, like the 1994 spin-off, which is part of the divestment phase. So the answer should cite S9 and S10."

[S3] ## Rise of mortgage origination (1997\u20132006)\n\nLehman was one of the first Wall Street firms to move into the business of mortgage origination. [S4] In 1997, Lehman bought Colorado-based lender, Aurora Loan Services (not a bank), an Alt-A lender. [S5] In 2000, to expand their mortgage origination pipeline, Lehman purchased West Coast subprime mortgage lender BNC Mortgage LLC. [S6] Lehman quickly became a force in the subprime market. [S7] By 2003 Lehman made $18.2 billion in loans and ranked third in lending. [S8] By 2004, this number topped $40 billion. [S9] By 2006, Aurora and BNC were lending almost $50 billion per month. [S10] By 2008, Lehman had assets of $680 billion supported by only $22.5 billion of firm capital. [S11] From an equity position, its risky commercial real estate holdings were thirty times greater than capital. [S12] In such a highly leveraged structure, a 3 to 5 percent decline in real estate values would wipe out all capital. [S13] ## Collapse\n\n\n### Causes\n\n\n#### Malfeasance\n\nA March 2010 report by the court appointed examiner indicated that Lehman executives regularly used cosmetic accounting gimmicks at the end of each quarter to make its finances appear less shaky than they really were. [S14] This practice was a type of repurchase agreement that temporarily removed securities from the company's balance sheet. [S15] However, unlike typical repurchase agreements, these deals were described by Lehman as the outright sale of securities and created \"a materially misleading picture of the firm's financial condition in late 2007 and 2008\". [S16] #### Subprime mortgage crisis\n\nIn August 2007, the firm closed its subprime lender, BNC Mortgage, eliminating 1,200 positions in 23 locations, and took an after-tax charge of $25\u00a0million and a $27\u00a0million reduction in goodwill. [S17] Lehman said that poor market conditions in the mortgage space \"necessitated a substantial reduction in its resources and capacity in the subprime space.\"\n\nIn September 2007, Joe Gregory appointed Erin Callan as CFO. [S18] On March 16, 2008, after rival Bear Stearns was taken over by JPMorgan Chase in a fire sale, market analysts suggested that Lehman would be the next major investment bank to fall. [S19] Callan fielded Lehman's first quarter conference call, where the firm posted a profit of $48.9 million, compared to Citigroup's $5.1 billion and Merrill Lynch's $1.97 billion losses which was Lehman's 55th consecutive profitable quarter. [S20] The firm's stock price leapt 46 percent after that announcement. [S21] In 2008, Lehman faced an unprecedented loss to the continuing subprime mortgage crisis. [S22] Lehman's loss was a result of having held on to large positions in subprime and other lower-rated mortgage tranches when securitizing the underlying mortgages; it is unclear whether Lehman was simply unable to sell the lower-rated bonds or voluntarily kept them. [S23] In any event, huge losses accrued in lower-rated mortgage-backed securities throughout 2008. [S24] In the second fiscal quarter, Lehman reported losses of $2.8\u00a0billion and was forced to sell off $6\u00a0billion in assets. [S25] In the first half of 2008 alone, Lehman stock lost 73% of its value as the credit market continued to tighten.",

I need to look through the provided supporting context and pick out the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of Lehman's mortgage activities during that time. The chunk starts with [S3] which is titled \"Rise of mortgage origination (1997\u20132006)\". That's a good starting point. \n\n[S3] says Lehman was one of the first to move into mortgage origination. Then [S4] mentions they bought Aurora Loan Services in 1997. [S5] talks about purchasing BNC Mortgage LLC in 2000. [S6] states they became a force in the subprime market. [S7] notes that by 2003, they made $18.2 billion in loans and were third in lending. [S8] says by 2004, that number topped $40 billion. [S9] mentions that by 2006, Aurora and BNC were lending almost $50 billion monthly. \n\nI need to make sure these are the key points. The question is about developments, so the acquisitions and growth in loan amounts are crucial. The other parts of the context discuss later events like the collapse, which are outside the 1997-2006 window. \n\nSo the answer should include the entry into mortgage origination, the acquisitions of Aurora and BNC, expansion into subprime, and the growth in loan volumes. Each of these points is supported by the cited sentences. I need to structure each statement with the correct citations. Also, check if any other sentences in the context might be relevant, but I think those mentioned cover the key developments."

[S2] In the second fiscal quarter, Lehman reported losses of $2.8\u00a0billion and was forced to sell off $6\u00a0billion in assets. [S3] In the first half of 2008 alone, Lehman stock lost 73% of its value as the credit market continued to tighten. [S4] On June 9, 2008, Lehman Brothers announced a US$2.8 billion second-quarter loss, its first since being spun off from American Express, as market volatility rendered many of its hedges ineffective during that time. [S5] Lehman also reported that it had raised a further $6 billion in capital. [S6] As a result, there was major management shakeup, in which Hugh \"Skip\" McGee III (head of investment banking) held a meeting with senior staff to strip CEO Richard Fuld and his lieutenants of their authority. [S7] Consequently, Joe Gregory agreed to resign as president and COO, and afterward he told Erin Callan that she had to resign as CFO. [S8] Callan was appointed CFO of Lehman in 2008 but served only for six months, before departing after her mentor Joe Gregory was demoted. [S9] Bart McDade was named to succeed Gregory as president and COO, when several senior executives threatened to leave if he was not promoted. [S10] McDade took charge and brought back Michael Gelband and Alex Kirk, who had previously been pushed out of the firm by Gregory for not taking risks. [S11] Although Fuld remained CEO, he soon became isolated from McDade's team. [S12] In August 2008, Lehman reported that it intended to release 6% of its work force, 1,500 people, just ahead of its third-quarter-reporting deadline in September. [S13] On August 22, 2008, shares in Lehman closed up 5% (16% for the week) on reports that the state-controlled Korea Development Bank was considering buying the bank. [S14] Most of those gains were quickly eroded as news came in that Korea Development Bank was \"facing difficulties pleasing regulators and attracting partners for the deal.\"\n\nOn September 9, Lehman's shares plunged 45% to $7.79, after it was reported that the state-run South Korean firm had put talks on hold. [S15] Investor confidence continued to erode as Lehman's stock lost roughly half its value and pushed the S&P 500 down 3.4% on September 9. [S16] The Dow Jones lost 300 points the same day on investors' concerns about the security of the bank. [S17] The U.S. [S18] government did not announce any plans to assist with any possible financial crisis that emerged at Lehman. [S19] The next day, Lehman announced a loss of $3.9\u00a0billion and its intent to sell off a majority stake in its investment-management business, which included Neuberger Berman. [S20] The stock slid seven percent that day. [S21] Lehman, after earlier rejecting questions on the sale of the company, was reportedly searching for a buyer as its stock price dropped another 40 percent on September 11, 2008. [S22] Just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, executives at Neuberger Berman sent e-mail memos suggesting, among other things, that the Lehman Brothers' top people forgo multimillion-dollar bonuses to \"send a strong message to both employees and investors that management is not shirking accountability for recent performance.\" Lehman Brothers Investment Management Director George Herbert Walker IV dismissed the proposal, going so far as to actually apologize to other members of the Lehman Brothers executive committee for the idea having been suggested.

[S3] I'm embarrassed and I apologize.\"\n\n\n#### Short-selling allegations\n\nDuring hearings on the bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers and bailout of AIG before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, former Lehman Brothers CEO Richard Fuld said a host of factors including a crisis of confidence and naked short-selling attacks followed by false rumors contributed to both the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. [S4] House committee Chairman Henry Waxman said the committee received thousands of pages of internal documents from Lehman and these documents portray a company in which there was \"no accountability for failure\". [S5] An article by journalist Matt Taibbi in *Rolling Stone* contended that naked short selling contributed to the demise of both Lehman and Bear Stearns. [S6] A study by finance researchers at the University of Oklahoma Price College of Business studied trading in financial stocks, including Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, and found \"no evidence that stock price declines were caused by naked short selling\". [S7] ### Bankruptcy\n\nOn Saturday, September 13, 2008, Timothy F. [S8] Geithner, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, called a meeting on the future of Lehman, which included the possibility of an emergency liquidation of its assets. [S9] Lehman reported that it had been in talks with Bank of America and Barclays for the company's possible sale; however, both Barclays and Bank of America ultimately declined to purchase the entire company, in the former case because the British government (in particular, the Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the CEO of the Financial Services Authority Hector Sants) refused to allow the transaction at the last minute, quoting stockholder regulations in the UK, despite a deal having apparently been completed. [S10] The next day, Sunday, September 14, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) offered an exceptional trading session to allow market participants to offset positions in various derivatives on the condition of a Lehman bankruptcy later that day. [S11] Although the bankruptcy filing missed the deadline, many dealers honored the trades they made in the special session. [S12] Shortly before 1\u00a0am Monday morning (UTC\u22125), Lehman Brothers Holdings announced it would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection citing bank debt of $613\u00a0billion, $155\u00a0billion in bond debt, and assets worth $639\u00a0billion. [S13] It further announced that its subsidiaries would continue to operate as normal. [S14] A group of Wall Street firms agreed to provide capital and financial assistance for the bank's orderly liquidation and the Federal Reserve, in turn, agreed to a swap of lower-quality assets in exchange for loans and other assistance from the government. [S15] The morning witnessed scenes of Lehman employees removing files, items with the company logo, and other belongings from the world headquarters at 745 Seventh Avenue. [S16] The spectacle continued throughout the day and into the following day. [S17] Brian Marsal, co-chief executive of the restructuring firm Alvarez and Marsal was appointed as chief restructuring officer and subsequently chief executive officer of the company. [S18] Later that day, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) suspended Lehman's Australian subsidiary as a market participant after clearing-houses terminated contracts with the firm. [S19] Lehman shares tumbled over 90% on September 15, 2008. [S20] The Dow Jones closed down just over 500 points on September 15, 2008, which was at the time the largest drop in a single day since the days following the attacks on September 11, 2001.",

[S6] On September 17, 2008, the New York Stock Exchange delisted Lehman Brothers. [S7] On March 16, 2011 some three years after filing for bankruptcy and following a filing in a Manhattan U.S. [S8] bankruptcy court, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc announced it would seek creditor approval of its reorganization plan by October 14 followed by a confirmation hearing to follow on November 17. [S9] ### Liquidation\n\n\n#### Barclays acquisition\n\nOn September 16, 2008, Barclays PLC announced that they would acquire a \"stripped clean\" portion of Lehman for $1.75\u00a0billion, including most of Lehman's North America operations. [S10] On September 20, 2008, a revised version of the deal, a $1.35\u00a0billion (\u00a3700\u00a0million) plan for Barclays to acquire the core business of Lehman (mainly its $960-million headquarters, a 38-story office building in Midtown Manhattan, with responsibility for 9,000 former employees), was approved. [S11] After a 7-hour hearing, U.S. [S12] bankruptcy judge James Peck ruled:\n\n> \"I have to approve this transaction because it is the only available transaction. [S13] Lehman Brothers became a victim, in effect the only true icon to fall in a tsunami that has befallen the credit markets. [S14] This is the most momentous bankruptcy hearing I've ever sat through. [S15] It can never be deemed precedent for future cases. [S16] It's hard for me to imagine a similar emergency.\"\n\nLuc Despins, then a partner at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, the creditors committee counsel, said: \"The reason we're not objecting is really based on the lack of a viable alternative. [S17] We did not support the transaction because there had not been enough time to properly review it.\" In the amended agreement, Barclays would absorb $47.4\u00a0billion in securities and assume $45.5\u00a0billion in trading liabilities. [S18] Lehman's attorney Harvey R. [S19] Miller of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, said \"the purchase price for the real estate components of the deal would be $1.29\u00a0billion, including $960\u00a0million for Lehman's New York headquarters and $330\u00a0million for two New Jersey data centers. [S20] Lehman's original estimate valued its headquarters at $1.02\u00a0billion but an appraisal from CB Richard Ellis this week valued it at $900\u00a0million.\" Barclays were not to acquire Lehman's Eagle Energy unit, but to have entities known as Lehman Brothers Canada Inc, Lehman Brothers Sudamerica, Lehman Brothers Uruguay and its Private Investment Management business for high-net-worth individuals. [S21] Finally, Lehman would retain $20\u00a0billion of securities assets in Lehman Brothers Inc that are not being transferred to Barclays.

I need to look at the supporting context provided and find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the chunks, the first sentence [S1] says: \"Later that day, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) suspended Lehman's Australian subsidiary as a market participant after clearing-houses terminated contracts with the firm.\" So this seems directly related. The key point here is that the suspension happened after clearing-houses terminated contracts with Lehman. \n\nThe other sentences mention things like Lehman shares tumbling, the Dow Jones drop, and other subsidiaries filing for reorganization, but those don't directly answer the question. The answer is specifically about the Australian subsidiary's suspension. The citation here would be [S1], since that's the sentence that explains the reason. I don't see any other sentences that mention the ASX suspension. So the answer should be that the termination of contracts by clearing-houses led to the suspension, cited from S1."

      "chunk": "Chunk:\n\n[S1] Later that day, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) suspended Lehman's Australian subsidiary as a market participant after clearing-houses terminated contracts with the firm. [S2] Lehman shares tumbled over 90% on September 15, 2008. [S3] The Dow Jones closed down just over 500 points on September 15, 2008, which was at the time the largest drop in a single day since the days following the attacks on September 11, 2001. [S4] In the United Kingdom, the investment bank went to administration with PricewaterhouseCoopers appointed as administrators. [S5] In Japan, the Japanese branch, Lehman Brothers Japan Inc., and its holding company filed for civil reorganization on September 16, 2008, in Tokyo District Court. [S6] On September 17, 2008, the New York Stock Exchange delisted Lehman Brothers. [S7] On March 16, 2011 some three years after filing for bankruptcy and following a filing in a Manhattan U.S. [S8] bankruptcy court, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc announced it would seek creditor approval of its reorganization plan by October 14 followed by a confirmation hearing to follow on November 17. [S9] ### Liquidation\n\n\n#### Barclays acquisition\n\nOn September 16, 2008, Barclays PLC announced that they would acquire a \"stripped clean\" portion of Lehman for $1.75\u00a0billion, including most of Lehman's North America operations. [S10] On September 20, 2008, a revised version of the deal, a $1.35\u00a0billion (\u00a3700\u00a0million) plan for Barclays to acquire the core business of Lehman (mainly its $960-million headquarters, a 38-story office building in Midtown Manhattan, with responsibility for 9,000 former employees), was approved. [S11] After a 7-hour hearing, U.S. [S12] bankruptcy judge James Peck ruled:\n\n> \"I have to approve this transaction because it is the only available transaction. [S13] Lehman Brothers became a victim, in effect the only true icon to fall in a tsunami that has befallen the credit markets. [S14] This is the most momentous bankruptcy hearing I've ever sat through. [S15] It can never be deemed precedent for future cases. [S16] It's hard for me to imagine a similar emergency.\"\n\nLuc Despins, then a partner at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, the creditors committee counsel, said: \"The reason we're not objecting is really based on the lack of a viable alternative. [S17] We did not support the transaction because there had not been enough time to properly review it.\" In the amended agreement, Barclays would absorb $47.4\u00a0billion in securities and assume $45.5\u00a0billion in trading liabilities. [S18] Lehman's attorney Harvey R. [S19] Miller of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, said \"the purchase price for the real estate components of the deal would be $1.29\u00a0billion, including $960\u00a0million for Lehman's New York headquarters and $330\u00a0million for two New Jersey data centers. [S20] Lehman's original estimate valued its headquarters at $1.02\u00a0billion but an appraisal from CB Richard Ellis this week valued it at $900\u00a0million.\" Barclays were not to acquire Lehman's Eagle Energy unit, but to have entities known as Lehman Brothers Canada Inc, Lehman Brothers Sudamerica, Lehman Brothers Uruguay and its Private Investment Management business for high-net-worth individuals. [S21] Finally, Lehman would retain $20\u00a0billion of securities assets in Lehman Brothers Inc that are not being transferred to Barclays. [S22] Barclays acquired a potential liability of $2.5\u00a0billion to be paid as severance, if it chooses not to retain some Lehman employees beyond the guaranteed 90 days. [S23] #### Nomura acquisition\n\nNomura Holdings, Japan's top brokerage firm, agreed to buy the Asian division of Lehman Brothers for $225\u00a0million and parts of the European division for a nominal fee of $2.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the amount Barclays agreed to pay for the core business of Lehman Brothers in the revised deal. I need to look through the supporting context provided and find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of Barclays and the revised deal. The user mentioned that the answer should be cited with sentence numbers. Let me check each sentence.\n\nLooking at the chunk provided, there's a section titled \"Barclays acquisition\". In that section, sentence [S9] starts with \"On September 16, 2008, Barclays PLC announced...\" and mentions $1.75 billion for a \"stripped clean\" portion. But the question is about the revised deal. Then, sentence [S10] says: \"On September 20, 2008, a revised version of the deal, a $1.35 billion (\u00a3700 million) plan...\" So this seems to be the revised deal. The question specifically asks for the revised deal's amount, so $1.35 billion is the figure here. \n\nI should check if there are other sentences that mention the amount. For example, later sentences like [S18] talk about Barclays absorbing $47.4 billion in securities and assuming $45.5 billion in liabilities, but that's part of the terms, not the purchase price. [S19] mentions the purchase price for real estate components as $1.29 billion, but that's part of the deal, not the core business. The question is about the core business, which in the revised deal is $1.35 billion. \n\nSo the answer should be $1.35 billion, cited from [S10]. Let me make sure there's no other conflicting info. The sentence [S10] clearly states the revised deal's amount. Therefore, the answer is $1.35 billion with citation [S10]."

[S13] The Dow eventually closed at a new six-year low of 7,552.29 on November 20, followed by a further drop to 6626 by March of the next year. [S14] The fall of Lehman also had a strong effect on small private investors such as bond holders and holders of so-called minibonds. [S15] In Germany, structured products, often based on an index, were sold mostly to private investors, elderly, retired persons, students and families.

[S17] Valukas, a court-appointed examiner, published the results of its year-long investigation into the finances of Lehman Brothers. [S18] This report revealed that Lehman Brothers used an accounting procedure termed repo 105 to temporarily exchange $50\u00a0billion of assets into cash just before publishing its financial statements. [S19] The action could be seen to implicate both Ernst & Young, the bank's accountancy firm and Richard S. [S20] Fuld, Jr, the former CEO. [S21] This could potentially lead to Ernst & Young being found guilty of financial malpractice and Fuld facing time in prison. [S22] According to *The Wall Street Journal*, in March 2011, the SEC announced that they weren't confident that they could prove that Lehman Brothers violated US laws in its accounting practices.

The reason given is that they only took on employees, not the actual assets like stocks or bonds. \n\nAnother sentence [S1] mentions that \"It would not take on any trading assets or liabilities in the European units.\" This also supports the idea that the acquisition was limited to employees, which would justify a lower price since they weren't taking on the risky assets. \n\nAdditionally, [S3] talks about the non-US subsidiaries contributing over 50% of global revenue, but that might not directly answer why the price was low. It might even suggest that the units were valuable, but the reason for the low price is more about what was acquired, not the value of the subsidiaries. \n\nSo the main reasons from the context are that Nomura only took employees and not the assets, which is mentioned in [S2] and [S1]. Therefore, the answer should cite these two sentences."

Other sentences mention different figures, like $105 billion in [S1] and $1.42 billion in [S2], but those are from different time periods (January 2016 and a lawsuit settlement).

      "question": "What was the amount JPMorgan agreed to pay in cash to settle a lawsuit related to Lehman Brothers' liquidity issues?",
      "answer": "<statement>JPMorgan agreed to pay $1.42 billion in cash to settle a lawsuit related to Lehman Brothers' liquidity issues.<cite>[S2]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the amount JPMorgan agreed to pay in cash to settle a lawsuit related to Lehman Brothers' liquidity issues.\n\nLooking at the supporting context provided, I need to scan through the sentences to find the relevant information. Let me go through each sentence one by one.\n\nSentence [S1] talks about Lehman paying over $105 billion to unsecured creditors. But the question is about JPMorgan's payment, so this might not be relevant.\n\n[S2] mentions \"JPMorgan will pay $1.42 billion in cash to settle a lawsuit accusing JPMorgan of draining Lehman Brothers liquidity right before the crash.\" This seems directly related. The amount here is $1.42 billion, and it's about a lawsuit related to liquidity issues. That's probably the answer.\n\n[S3] refers to a settlement allowing another $1.496 billion and $76 million. But it doesn't mention JPMorgan specifically, so maybe this is part of another settlement or a different part of the same case? Not sure, but the question is about JPMorgan's payment, so [S2] is more directly relevant.\n\n[S4] and onwards talk about Lehman's liquidation and other details, but not JPMorgan's payment. The rest of the sentences mention merger history, officers, pop culture, etc., which don't relate to the question.\n\nSo the answer should be $1.42 billion from sentence [S2]. I need to make sure there's no other mention. Let me check again. No, [S3] is about another part of the settlement, but the question specifically asks for the cash amount from JPMorgan. So [S2] is the correct citation."
