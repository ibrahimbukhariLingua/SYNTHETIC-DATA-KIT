      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking about Richard Warke's role in the Augusta Group of Companies. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the text for mentions of Augusta Group of Companies. Let's go through each sentence:\n\n[S1] Just mentions Richard Warke's name, no role here.\n[S2] Here it says he is the chairman of the Augusta Group of Companies, including Titan Mining Corp and Solaris Resources Corp. That seems directly relevant.\n[S3] Talks about his partnerships with PGA Tour and Fenway Sports Group, not related to Augusta.\n[S4] Starts with \"Career\" but the content here is about his career beginning in mining, not his role in Augusta.\n[S5] His first mining deal, not about Augusta.\n[S6] Same as above.\n[S7] Details the sale of Ventana Gold, not related.\n[S8] More about Ventana Gold's project.\n[S9] Mentions selling Augusta Resource Corp., which is part of the Augusta Group? Maybe. But the sentence says he sold it, but the question is about his role. The previous sentence [S2] says he's chairman. \n[S10] Says he was the company's Executive Chairman, but that's for Augusta Resource Corp., which might be under the Augusta Group. \n[S11] About the sale to HudBay Minerals. \n[S12] The sale price. \n[S13] His attention to NewCastle Gold. \n[S14] About Equinox Gold. \n[S15] Selling Arizona Mining Inc. \n[S16] and [S17] Details about Arizona Mining's mine.\n\nSo the key points are [S2] where it states he is the chairman of the Augusta Group of Companies. Also, [S9] mentions he sold Augusta Resource Corp., which is part of the group. But the question is about his role, not his selling activities. Therefore, the direct answer is from [S2]. \n\nI should check if there's any other sentence. [S10] mentions he was Executive Chairman of Augusta Resource Corp., which is part of the Augusta Group. So maybe both [S2] and [S10] are relevant. But the question is about the Augusta Group of Companies, not the specific subsidiary. So [S2] is the main one. However, [S10] might also be a citation. Wait, the question is about his role in the Augusta Group. If [S2] says he's the chairman of the Augusta Group, then that's the primary citation. [S10] refers to his role in Augusta Resource Corp., which is a subsidiary. So the answer would be based on [S2]. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that Richard Warke is the chairman of the Augusta Group of Companies, citing [S2]. Also, maybe [S10] if the role is specifically as Executive Chairman. But the question is about the Augusta Group, not the subsidiary. So probably just [S2]. Let me check the exact wording. \n\nThe passage says in [S2]: \"He is the chairman of the Augusta Group of Companies, including Titan Mining Corp and Solaris Resources Corp.\" So that's the direct answer. The other sentence [S10] says \"As the company’s Executive Chairman, Warke led Augusta Resource Corp.\" But Augusta Resource Corp. is part of the Augusta Group. However, the question is about the Augusta Group as a whole. So the main citation is [S2]. \n\nSo the answer should be: Richard Warke is the chairman of the Augusta Group of Companies, citing [S2]. No other citations needed. Unless the user considers [S10] as part of the same role. But since the question is about the Group, not the subsidiary, [S2] is sufficient."

Let me check the rest. [S8] mentions Augusta Resource Corp, but the context here is about the sale of that company in 2014. However, the sentence says \"Augusta Resource Corp., an exploration company...\" but it's not clear if that's part of the Augusta Group. Wait, the original [S2] mentions the Augusta Group includes Titan and Solaris, but Augusta Resource Corp might be a different entity. However, the user is asking about the Augusta Group, so maybe Augusta Resource Corp is part of it? But the text doesn't explicitly state that. The sentence in [S8] is about the sale of Augusta Resource Corp, but the connection to the Augusta Group isn't made here. \n\nOther sentences mention companies like NewCastle Gold, Equinox Gold, Arizona Mining Inc., but those seem to be separate entities. The key is to stick to the citations. The only direct mention of the Augusta Group's companies is in [S2], which lists Titan Mining Corp and Solaris Resources Corp. So the answer should be those two companies, cited from [S2]. I need to make sure there's no other info elsewhere. The rest of the context talks about other companies Warke was involved with, but not necessarily part of the Augusta Group.

The location is the California-Vetas district of Colombia. \n\nWait, is there any other sentence that might mention the location? Let me check again. The other sentences talk about other projects like Rosemont Copper in Arizona, Castle Mountain in California, and Arizona Mining near the U.S.-Mexico border.

Then, sentence S10 says he led the company until it was sold in a friendly takeover to HudBay Minerals Inc. for C$666 million.

But the sentence that mentions the sale is S10, which says \"until it was sold in a friendly takeover to HudBay Minerals Inc. [S10] for C$666 million. [S11]\". So the actual amount is in S11. Therefore, the correct citation is [S11]. \n\nWait, but sometimes the numbering might be tricky. Let me confirm. The sentence structure is:\n\n[S8] Three years after the sale...
