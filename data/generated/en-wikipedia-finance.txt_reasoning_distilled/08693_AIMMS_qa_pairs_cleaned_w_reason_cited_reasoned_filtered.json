[S2] It has two main product offerings that provide modeling and optimization capabilities across a variety of industries. [S3] The AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform allows advanced users to develop optimization-based applications and deploy them to business users. [S4] AIMMS SC Navigator, launched in 2017, is built on the AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform and provides configurable Apps for supply chain teams. [S5] SC Navigator provides supply chain analytics to non-advanced users. [S6] ## History\n\nAIMMS B.V. [S7] was founded in 1989 by mathematician Johannes Bisschop under the name of Paragon Decision Technology. [S8] His vision was to make optimization more approachable by building models rather than programming. [S9] In Bisschop's view, modeling was able to build the bridge between the people who had problems and the people helping them solve those problems. [S10] AIMMS began as a software system designed for modeling and solving large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems. [S11] AIMMS is considered to be one of the five most important algebraic modeling languages. [S12] Bisschop was awarded with INFORMS Impact Prize for his work in this language. [S13] In 2003, AIMMS was acquired by a small private equity firm. [S14] This led to the creation of a partnership program, further technical investment and the evolution of the platform. [S15] In 2011, the company launched AIMMS PRO, a way to deploy applications to end-users who do not have a technical background. [S16] This was quickly followed by the ability to publish and customize applications using a browser so that decision support applications are available on any device. [S17] The company grew and was in 2017 recognized as a top B2B technology in the Netherlands, and was named one of the fastest-growing companies in the Netherlands for the second consecutive year. [S18] ## AIMMS SC Navigator Platform\n\nAlong with a growing interest in embedded advanced analytics for supply chain management, AIMMS developed the AIMMS SC Navigator Platform to allow for supply chain analytics. [S19] It was launched in October 2017 with three initial cloud-based Apps: Supply Chain Network Design, Sales & Operations Planning and Data Navigator. [S20] In 2018 they added Center of Gravity and Product Lifecycle. [S21] ## AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform\n\nThe AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform consists of an algebraic modeling language, an integrated development environment for both editing models and creating a graphical user interface around these models, and a graphical end-user environment. [S22] AIMMS is linked to multiple solvers through the AIMMS Open Solver Interface. [S23] Supported solvers include CPLEX, MOSEK, FICO Xpress, CBC, Conopt, MINOS, IPOPT, SNOPT, KNITRO and CP Optimizer. [S24] AIMMS features a mixture of declarative and imperative programming styles. [S25] Formulation of optimization models takes place through declarative language elements such as sets and indices, as well as scalar and multidimensional parameters, variables and constraints, which are common to all algebraic modeling languages, and allow for a concise description of most problems in the domain of mathematical optimization. [S26] Units of measurement are natively supported in the language, and compile- and runtime unit analysis may be employed to detect modeling errors. [S27] Procedures and control flow statements are available in AIMMS for\n\n* the exchange of data with external data sources such as spreadsheets, databases, XML and text files\n* data pre- and post-processing tasks around optimization models\n* user interface event handling\n* the construction of hybrid algorithms for problem types for which no direct efficient solvers are available. [S28] To support the re-use of common modeling components, AIMMS allows modelers to organize their model in user model libraries.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking in which countries AIMMS has offices. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find that information.\n\nLooking at the first chunk, there's a sentence [S1] that mentions AIMMS is a prescriptive analytics software company with offices in the Netherlands, United States, and Singapore. That seems to directly answer the question. I should check if there are any other sentences that mention countries, but scanning through the rest of the context, most of it talks about their products, history, and features. The other sentences mention countries in the context of awards or recognition, like the Netherlands being a top B2B tech company, but not office locations. \n\nSo the main answer is the Netherlands, United States, and Singapore. The citation for that is [S1]. I need to make sure there's no other info elsewhere. The history section mentions the company was founded in the Netherlands, but that's about the origin, not current offices. The rest of the sentences don't list other countries. So the answer should be those three countries with the citation from S1."

      "question": "What are the two main product offerings of AIMMS?",
      "answer": "<statement>The two main product offerings of AIMMS are the AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform and AIMMS SC Navigator.<cite>[S3][S4]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the two main product offerings of AIMMS. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find that information.\n\nStarting with the first part of the passage, there's a sentence that says, \"It has two main product offerings that provide modeling and optimization capabilities across a variety of industries.\" That's sentence [S2]. Then, the next sentences go on to describe the specific products. \n\nThe next sentence is [S3]: \"The AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform allows advanced users to develop optimization-based applications and deploy them to business users.\" Then [S4] mentions \"AIMMS SC Navigator, launched in 2017, is built on the AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform and provides configurable Apps for supply chain teams.\" \n\nSo, from this, the two main products seem to be the AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform and AIMMS SC Navigator. The first sentence [S2] mentions there are two main offerings, and then the following sentences detail each one. \n\nI should check if there are any other mentions. The section about the Prescriptive Analytics Platform continues, but the key point is that the two main products are the Prescriptive Analytics Platform and SC Navigator. The answer should cite [S2] for the mention of two main offerings and [S3] and [S4] for the specific names. Wait, but the question is asking for the two main product offerings, so the answer would list them as the Prescriptive Analytics Platform and SC Navigator. The citations would be [S2] for the existence of two products, and then [S3] and [S4] for each product's description. However, the user's instructions say each sentence should have its own citations. So the statement mentioning the two products would cite [S2], and the subsequent sentences detailing each product would cite [S3] and [S4] respectively. \n\nSo the answer would be structured as two sentences: one stating the two products, citing [S2], and then each product's description with their respective citations. But the user might want the answer to directly list the two products with their citations. Let me make sure. The question is \"What are the two main product offerings of AIMMS?\" So the answer is the names of the two products. The supporting context says in [S2] that there are two main product offerings, and then [S3] and [S4] describe them. Therefore, the answer should be the two product names, each cited with their respective sentences. \n\nSo the correct answer would be:\n\nThe two main product offerings of AIMMS are the AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform and AIMMS SC Navigator. [S3][S4]\n\nBut wait, the initial mention of the two products is in [S2], but the specific names are in [S3] and [S4]. So maybe the answer should cite [S2] for the existence and [S3][S4] for the names. However, the user's instruction says each sentence should have citations. So if the answer is a single sentence stating both products, then the citations would be [S2][S3][S4]? But the way the answer is structured is that each sentence is a separate statement. \n\nLooking at the example given in the response format, each sentence is a separate <statement> with its own citations. So if the answer is two sentences, each explaining a product, then each would have their own citations. But the question is asking for the two products, so maybe one sentence listing both, citing [S2], [S3], and [S4]. But the user's example shows that each sentence is a separate statement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is two statements: one stating the first product with [S3], and another stating the second product with [S4], and then a third statement citing [S2] for the two main offerings. But that might not be necessary. \n\nWait, the user's example shows that a sentence can have multiple citations. So the answer could be a single sentence that lists both products, citing [S2] (for the fact that there are two) and [S3] and [S4] (for the names). But the exact wording in the context is that [S2] says \"two main product offerings\" and then [S3] and [S4] describe them. So the answer would be:\n\n<statement>The two main product offerings of AIMMS are the AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform and AIMMS SC Navigator.<cite>[S2][S3][S4]</cite></statement>\n\nBut I need to check if that's accurate. The [S2] mentions the existence of two products, but the actual names are in [S3] and [S4]. So the sentence that lists the names would need to cite [S3] and [S4], while the sentence that mentions the existence of two products would cite [S2]. However, if the answer is a single sentence that combines both, then all three citations would be appropriate. But maybe the correct approach is to have two separate sentences: one stating the two products (citing [S2]), and then each product's description (citing [S3] and [S4]). However, the question is asking for the product offerings, not their descriptions. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be:\n\n<statement>The two main product offerings of AIMMS are the AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform and AIMMS SC Navigator.<cite>[S3][S4]</cite></statement>\n\nBut [S3] and [S4] are the sentences that describe each product. However, the actual names are in those sentences. So that's correct. The [S2] is the sentence that mentions there are two, but the names are in [S3] and [S4]. Therefore, the answer should cite [S3] and [S4] for the product names. However, the user might expect [S2] as well. But according to the instructions, each sentence should have citations for the information in that sentence. If the sentence is stating the product names, then the citations would be [S3] and [S4], since those sentences contain the names. The [S2] is a general statement about the existence of two products, but not the names. So the answer would be the two product names, each cited with their respective sentences. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n<statement>The two main product offerings of AIMMS are the AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform and AIMMS SC Navigator.<cite>[S3][S4]</cite></statement>"

I need to look through the provided supporting context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for mentions of the AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform. Let's see... \n\nIn the context, there's a section titled \"AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform\". The sentence there says: \"The AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform consists of an algebraic modeling language, an integrated development environment for both editing models and creating a graphical user interface around these models, and a graphical end-user environment.\" That's part of the description, but maybe not the exact purpose. \n\nAnother sentence earlier in the chunk is [S3]: \"The AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform allows advanced users to develop optimization-based applications and deploy them to business users.\" That sounds like a direct answer. It mentions the purpose as enabling advanced users to develop and deploy optimization apps. \n\nThen there's [S22] which details the components of the platform, but that's more about what it includes rather than the purpose. The question is about the purpose, so [S3] seems relevant. \n\nAre there other sentences? Let me check again. The section about AIMMS SC Navigator mentions it's built on the Prescriptive Analytics Platform, but that's more about specific applications. The main purpose is likely covered in [S3]. \n\nSo the answer should state that the platform allows advanced users to develop and deploy optimization-based applications. The citation would be [S3]. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other sentence that adds to this. For example, [S22] talks about the components, but the purpose is more about enabling development and deployment.

I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the text for mentions of Johannes Bisschop and any awards. The context starts with information about AIMMS, its history, and features. Then, under the \"History\" section, there's a sentence that says: \"AIMMS B.V. [S7] was founded in 1989 by mathematician Johannes Bisschop under the name of Paragon Decision Technology.\" So that's where he's mentioned as the founder.\n\nContinuing down, there's a sentence: \"Bisschop was awarded with INFORMS Impact Prize for his work in this language.\" That seems relevant. The INFORMS Impact Prize is the award mentioned here. Let me check the citation numbers. The sentence about the award is [S12], but wait, the sentence after that says \"In 2003, AIMMS was acquired...\" which is [S14]. Wait, no, the award is mentioned in [S12]? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the text: \"Bisschop was awarded with INFORMS Impact Prize for his work in this language. [S13]\" Wait, the sentence structure here might be tricky. Let me parse it again. The text says:\n\n\"S12] AIMMS is considered to be one of the five most important algebraic modeling languages.

The sentence about user model libraries is the only one that directly addresses model re-use. So the answer should be that AIMMS provides user model libraries for re-using common components. The citation would be [S28]."

Then, looking at [S2], it says \"Procedures and control flow statements are available in AIMMS for...\" followed by a list. The bullet points under [S2] are the key here. \n\nThe first bullet point is about exchanging data with external sources like spreadsheets, databases, etc. The second is data pre- and post-processing around optimization models. The third is user interface event handling. The fourth is constructing hybrid algorithms when no efficient solvers exist. \n\nSo these four points are the primary uses. The question is asking for the primary uses, so these four bullets under [S2] should be the answer. I need to make sure there are no other mentions of procedures or control flow elsewhere. Checking the rest of the context, other sentences talk about model libraries, optimization problem types, hybrid algorithms with GMP, and industry uses. But the specific uses of procedures and control flow are only in [S2]. \n\nTherefore, the answer should list those four points. Each sentence in the answer should cite [S2].

So the user's answer should have one statement citing [S2], but the four points are part of that sentence. However, the user's example shows that a sentence can have multiple citations. But the question is about the primary uses, which are the four points under [S2]. So the answer would be a single statement that lists those four points, citing [S2].

But in the original context, they are part of the same sentence [S2]. \n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. The original context's [S2] is one sentence with four bullet points. But the user's answer needs to have each sentence in <statement> tags. So maybe each bullet point is considered a separate sentence? Or is the entire list considered one sentence?

I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nLooking at the chunks, there's a section labeled \"Use in industry\" starting at [S7]. Then, [S8] mentions \"GE Grid uses AIMMS as the modeling and optimization engine of its energy market clearing software.\" That seems to directly answer the question. \n\nI should check if there are other mentions. [S9] talks about AIMMS being part of the analytics team of Midwest ISO, but it's not the company using it. The question specifically asks for the company, so GE Grid is the one mentioned here. \n\nNo other sentences in the context mention other companies using AIMMS for energy market clearing. So the answer should be GE Grid, cited from [S8]."
