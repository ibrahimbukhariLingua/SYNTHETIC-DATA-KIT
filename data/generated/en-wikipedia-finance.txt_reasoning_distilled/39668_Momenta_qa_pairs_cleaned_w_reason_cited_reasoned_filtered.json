  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Momenta in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document introduces Momenta Global Limited as a Chinese company focused on intelligent driving technologies. It was founded in 2016 by Cao Xudong, who previously worked at Microsoft and SenseTime. The key points here are the company's focus, founding details, and early investments like from Mercedes-Benz.\n\nNext, the history section mentions that Momenta became a unicorn in 2021 with a $1B valuation, backed by investors like GM, IDG, and others. They have partnerships with major automakers such as SAIC, Toyota, Bosch, and Mercedes. There's also info about joint ventures with BYD and Audi, and collaborations with Nvidia and Qualcomm. The 2024 developments include a joint venture with Audi and the release of an end-to-end self-driving model.\n\nThe products section states that Momenta doesn't build cars but sells software to automakers. They use deep learning and data for self-driving tech, with a two-pronged approach: selling semi-automated software and investing in future tech. The key concept here is their business model and technological focus.\n\nSo, the main topic is Momenta's role in autonomous driving tech, their partnerships, funding, and product strategy. I need to condense this into 3-5 sentences. Make sure to mention the company's focus, key investors and partners, their business model (selling software), and recent developments like the end-to-end model and joint ventures. Avoid minor details like specific dates unless they're crucial. Check for clarity and conciseness.\n</think>\n\nMomenta Global Limited is a Chinese tech company specializing in intelligent driving technologies, founded in 2016 by Cao Xudong, and known for its autonomous driving software sold to automakers rather than building vehicles itself. It gained prominence as a $1 billion+ unicorn in 2021, backed by investors like General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, and Tencent, and has formed strategic partnerships with major automakers such as SAIC, Toyota, and Audi, as well as tech firms like Nvidia and Qualcomm. The company focuses on deep learning for self-driving systems, adopting a dual strategy of licensing semi-automated software while advancing next-generation autonomous technologies, including its 2024 release of an end-to-end self-driving model for mass production.",

[S3] In 2017, Mercedes-Benz Group invested in Momenta, which was the automaker's first-ever investment into a Chinese startup. [S4] Momenta became the first Chinese unicorn in the field of self-driving cars after investors valued the company at more than $1 billion in 2021. [S5] The investors included, in addition to those already mentioned, General Motors (GM), IDG Capital, GGV Capital, Blue Lake Capital, Shunwei Capital, and Cathay Capital. [S6] General Motors invested $300 million in Momenta, as was announced in 2021, with the aim to accelerate the development of self-driving cars in China. [S7] By that time, Momenta struck partnerships with SAIC Motor, Toyota, auto parts supplier Bosch, Mercedes-Benz, Temasek, Yunfeng Capital, and Tencent. [S8] Since 2021, SAIC Motors and Momenta have worked together on robotaxi operations in Shanghai and Suzhou. [S9] In addition, Momenta is also supplying autonomous driving technology to SAIC's IM. [S10] In December 2021, Momenta and BYD established a joint venture, called DiPi Intelligent Mobility Co, located in Shenzhen, to deploy autonomous driving capabilities across certain BYD car model lines. [S11] In 2023, General Motors China received approval to conduct road tests in Shanghai for its autonomous vehicles developed in collaboration with Momenta. [S12] In 2024, additional partnerships with Nvidia and Qualcomm followed.

The citation for that sentence is [S1]. I need to make sure there's no other mention of the full name elsewhere. Scanning through the rest of the context, I don't see any other full names. The answer should be Momenta Global Limited with the citation [S1]."

Scanning through the other sentences, [S3] talks about Mercedes-Benz investing in 2017, [S4] mentions 2021 when they became a unicorn.

[S2] ## History\n\nMomenta was founded in September 2016 led by Cao Xudong, a former scientist at Microsoft Research and formerly executive director of research and development at Chinese deep-learning and computer vision company SenseTime. [S3] In 2017, Mercedes-Benz Group invested in Momenta, which was the automaker's first-ever investment into a Chinese startup. [S4] Momenta became the first Chinese unicorn in the field of self-driving cars after investors valued the company at more than $1 billion in 2021. [S5] The investors included, in addition to those already mentioned, General Motors (GM), IDG Capital, GGV Capital, Blue Lake Capital, Shunwei Capital, and Cathay Capital. [S6] General Motors invested $300 million in Momenta, as was announced in 2021, with the aim to accelerate the development of self-driving cars in China. [S7] By that time, Momenta struck partnerships with SAIC Motor, Toyota, auto parts supplier Bosch, Mercedes-Benz, Temasek, Yunfeng Capital, and Tencent. [S8] Since 2021, SAIC Motors and Momenta have worked together on robotaxi operations in Shanghai and Suzhou. [S9] In addition, Momenta is also supplying autonomous driving technology to SAIC's IM. [S10] In December 2021, Momenta and BYD established a joint venture, called DiPi Intelligent Mobility Co, located in Shenzhen, to deploy autonomous driving capabilities across certain BYD car model lines. [S11] In 2023, General Motors China received approval to conduct road tests in Shanghai for its autonomous vehicles developed in collaboration with Momenta. [S12] In 2024, additional partnerships with Nvidia and Qualcomm followed. [S13] In August 2024, Audi and SAIC Motor announced a joint venture in which Momenta is contributing a system for autonomous driving. [S14] In September 2024, Momenta introduced its first end-to-end self-driving model intended for mass production. [S15] ## Products\n\nMomenta does not build cars itself, but sells their car software to automakers. [S16] The company works on deep learning capacities, the so-called \"brains\", of cars. [S17] Momenta's software is fed with large amounts of data which are needed in particular for the development of self-driving cars, so that they can achieve end-to-end intelligent driving. [S18] According to Rita Liao in *TechCrunch*, the company has a \"two-legged approach of selling semi-automated software while investing in research for next-gen self-driving tech\".",
      "question": "What is Momenta's 'two-legged approach' according to Rita Liao?",
      "answer": "<statement>Momenta's 'two-legged approach' according to Rita Liao involves selling semi-automated software while investing in research for next-gen self-driving tech.<cite>[S18]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking about Momenta's 'two-legged approach' according to Rita Liao. I need to find the relevant part in the supporting context.\n\nLooking through the provided text, the chunk ends with a section about Products. Then there's a sentence that mentions Rita Liao's statement. Let me check each sentence. \n\nHere's the sentence: \"According to Rita Liao in *TechCrunch*, the company has a 'two-legged approach of selling semi-automated software while investing in research for next-gen self-driving tech'.\" That's sentence S18. \n\nSo the answer should reference that sentence. The question is asking specifically for the two-legged approach as per Rita Liao, so the citation would be [S18]. I need to make sure there are no other sentences that mention this. Scanning through again, the rest of the context talks about partnerships, investments, and products, but the specific mention of Rita Liao is only in S18. \n\nTherefore, the correct citation is [S18]. The answer should state the two-legged approach as described, with the citation at the end."
