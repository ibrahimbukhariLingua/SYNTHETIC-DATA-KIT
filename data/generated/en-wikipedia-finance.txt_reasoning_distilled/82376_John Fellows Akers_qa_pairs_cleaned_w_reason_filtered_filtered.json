  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about John Fellows Akers in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe document begins with his basic information: he was an American businessman, president, CEO, and chairman of IBM from 1983 to 1993. His education at Yale and joining IBM in 1960 after serving in the Navy as a jet pilot. Then there's a quote about IBM's traditional image. \n\nUnder the IBM section, he became CEO in 1985, supported by Frank Cary. He faced a decline in the mid-80s and early 90s. Steve Jobs' comment about him not knowing much about products. He simplified bureaucracy, restructured into autonomous divisions called \"Baby Blues,\" which led to downsizing, closing plants, and a workforce reduction. The company had a $5 billion loss, leading to his resignation in 1993. Gerstner took over as the first outsider CEO. \n\nIn retirement, he was on Lehman Brothers' board before their bankruptcy. He died in 2014.\n\nSo the main points are his roles at IBM, the restructuring and downsizing during his tenure, the challenges faced, his resignation, and his later roles. Need to highlight the key concepts: leadership during decline, restructuring efforts, workforce reduction, and the transition to Gerstner. Also mention his legacy and the factors leading to his resignation. Avoid minor details like the specific dates of events unless crucial. Make sure to connect the main ideas concisely.\n</think>\n\nJohn Fellows Akers was a prominent American businessman who served as president, CEO, and chairman of IBM from 1983 to 1993, navigating the company through a period of decline and restructuring. He implemented significant changes, including decentralizing IBM into autonomous \"Baby Blues\" divisions, cutting costs, and reducing the workforce by 47,000 employees, though these measures coincided with a $5 billion annual loss and a morale crisis. Despite his efforts to streamline operations and focus on profitability, his tenure ended with his forced resignation in 1993 amid financial struggles and board dissatisfaction, leading to the appointment of Louis V. Gerstner Jr., IBM's first external CEO. Akers' legacy reflects both his transformative strategies and the challenges of steering a tech giant during a turbulent era.",

      "chunk": "[S1] John Fellows Akers\n\n\n# John Fellows Akers\n\n\n\n**John Fellows Akers** (December 28, 1934 – August 22, 2014) was an American businessman. [S2] He was president (1983–1989), chief executive officer (1985–1993) and chairman (1986–1993) of IBM. [S3] ## Education\n\nAkers attended Yale, and while there joined Delta Kappa Epsilon (Phi chapter). [S4] ## IBM\n\nAkers joined IBM in 1960 after serving in the Navy as a jet pilot. [S5] Akers said in 2010 “We were very square. [S6] We wore the blue suits, white shirts with button-down collars, striped ties, fedoras and wingtip shoes. [S7] The customers felt they could count on us.”\n\nAkers became CEO in 1985. [S8] He benefitted from the support of one of his predecessors, Frank Cary. [S9] In 1989, a young Sam Palmisano was appointed as Aker's assistant; decades later Palmisano would serve as chairman and CEO. [S10] Akers was chief executive during IBM's decline in the mid-1980s and early 1990s. [S11] Apple Inc. [S12] founder Steve Jobs described Akers as \"*smart, eloquent, fantastic salesperson, but he didn’t know anything about product.*”\n\nAkers was credited with simplifying the company's bureaucracy to focus more on profits. [S13] On January 29, 1988, in a sweeping restructuring intended to reverse three years of disappointing performance, Akers created five new, highly autonomous organizations responsible for all of the company's innovation, design, and manufacturing. [S14] The moves were intended to greatly decentralize the company, which had been seen as bloated and unable to keep up with the competition and give significantly more responsibility to a younger generation of managers, while significantly reducing the role of the company's Armonk, N.Y., headquarters in the day-to-day operations. [S15] Under the plan, thousands of employees had to switch jobs or find themselves working for new managers. [S16] Akers' vision was to autonomize each division into \"Baby Blues\" with the aim of spinning them off from \"Big Blue\". [S17] Akers also presided over a major downsizing of IBM's workforce, cutting down from 407,000 to 360,000 by the end of 1991. [S18] The company had previously had a lifetime employment policy but successive voluntary buyouts and the first-ever layoff in March 1993, caused a morale crisis. [S19] Akers also closed ten plants and trimmed manufacturing capacity by forty percent. [S20] ### Retirement\n\nOn Tuesday, January 26, 1993, Akers was forced to announce his resignation, after several months of IBM insisting that it had full confidence in his leadership. [S21] The company had posted a $5 billion annual loss. [S22] The dividend was also slashed from $1.21 to 54 cents, after the company had failed to make enough profit to cover its dividend payments for eight business quarters. [S23] IBM president Jack Kuehler was shifted to the post of vice-chairman, while finance director Frank Metz was also ousted. [S24] Paul Rizzo, a rival with Akers for the CEO position back in 1985 who had retired in 1987 was restored to the post of vice-chairman and appointed finance director. [S25] Akers remained as chief executive for three months while a committee of directors chose a successor, long speculated to be an outsider. [S26] Akers retired as chairman and CEO of IBM on April 1, 1993. [S27] He was succeeded in both positions by Gerstner, the first CEO in IBM's history to attain the position from outside the company. [S28] The management coup was mounted by longtime IBM director Jim Burke, who organized secret meetings between Rizzo and outsider Louis V. [S29] Gerstner, Jr. [S30] to examine the company's problems. [S31] It was also speculated that several entities were dissatisfied with losing their power on the board of directors and the declining stock price, including the banks which were once IBM's largest shareholders, as well as Aker's predecessors as CEO, John Opel and Frank Cary. [S32] The company's difficulties weren't caused by Akers alone, as some suggested that he was merely doing what he had been \"programmed\" to do by an outdated \"IBM system\", while a complacent board of directors was also blamed. [S33] ## Other business roles",
      "question": "What positions did John Fellows Akers hold at IBM?",
      "answer": "<statement>John Fellows Akers held the positions of president, chief executive officer (CEO), and chairman at IBM.<cite>[S2]</cite></statement> <statement>He served as president from 1983 to 1989, CEO from 1985 to 1993, and chairman from 1986 to 1993.<cite>[S2]</cite></statement> <statement>Akers was forced to resign as CEO in 1993 after IBM posted a $5 billion annual loss, and he retired as chairman and CEO on April 1, 1993.<cite>[S21][S27]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the positions John Fellows Akers held at IBM. I need to look through the provided supporting context and find the relevant sentences.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage. The first mention is in [S2], which says he was president from 1983-1989, CEO from 1985-1993, and chairman from 1986-1993. That's a key part. Then later, [S8] mentions he became CEO in 1985, but that's already covered in [S2]. \n\nLooking at other sections, there's [S27] where it says he retired as chairman and CEO in 1993. Also, [S28] mentions he was succeeded by Gerstner as CEO. But the question is about the positions he held, not who succeeded him. \n\nAre there other positions mentioned? The education section [S3] talks about Yale, but that's not IBM. The IBM section [S5] says he joined in 1960, but doesn't mention specific roles then. The rest of the context discusses his tenure, decisions, and retirement, but the specific positions are covered in [S2]. \n\nSo the answer should list president, CEO, and chairman with the dates from [S2]. The citations would be [S2]. Wait, but [S8] also mentions CEO, but [S2] is more detailed. So the main citation is [S2]. I need to make sure each position is cited correctly. The user wants each sentence in the answer with citations. So the answer would be a statement citing [S2]."

The difference would be 407,000 minus 360,000, which is 47,000. But the question is asking for the number of employees cut, so the answer should be 47,000. The citation here is S18. \n\nI should check if there's any other sentence that mentions the number of employees cut. Let me scan through the other sentences again. S19 talks about voluntary buyouts and layoffs, but doesn't give a specific number. S20 mentions closing plants and trimming manufacturing capacity, but again, no exact number.

[S23] IBM president Jack Kuehler was shifted to the post of vice-chairman, while finance director Frank Metz was also ousted. [S24] Paul Rizzo, a rival with Akers for the CEO position back in 1985 who had retired in 1987 was restored to the post of vice-chairman and appointed finance director. [S25] Akers remained as chief executive for three months while a committee of directors chose a successor, long speculated to be an outsider. [S26] Akers retired as chairman and CEO of IBM on April 1, 1993. [S27] He was succeeded in both positions by Gerstner, the first CEO in IBM's history to attain the position from outside the company. [S28] The management coup was mounted by longtime IBM director Jim Burke, who organized secret meetings between Rizzo and outsider Louis V. [S29] Gerstner, Jr. [S30] to examine the company's problems. [S31] It was also speculated that several entities were dissatisfied with losing their power on the board of directors and the declining stock price, including the banks which were once IBM's largest shareholders, as well as Aker's predecessors as CEO, John Opel and Frank Cary. [S32] The company's difficulties weren't caused by Akers alone, as some suggested that he was merely doing what he had been \"programmed\" to do by an outdated \"IBM system\", while a complacent board of directors was also blamed.

It mentions that some suggested he was \"programmed\" by an outdated IBM system, and a complacent board of directors was also blamed. So here, the board of directors is mentioned as being blamed.
