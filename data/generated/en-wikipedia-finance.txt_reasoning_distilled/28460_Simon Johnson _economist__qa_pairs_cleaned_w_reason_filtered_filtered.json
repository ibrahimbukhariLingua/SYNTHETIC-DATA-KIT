So the answer is Chief Economist, cited from [S6]. \n\nAre there any other mentions? Let me check the rest. The rest of the sentences talk about his education, other positions, etc. So the only relevant sentence is [S6].

I need to look through the provided supporting context to find this information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for any mentions of a 2010 book by Simon Johnson. The chunk starts with information about Simon Johnson's career and education. Then, under the \"Research and publications\" section, there's a sentence that mentions \"He wrote the 2010 book *13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown* (ISBN 978-0307379054), along with James Kwak...\" So that seems to be the book they're asking about. \n\nI should check if there are any other mentions of books co-authored with James Kwak. The next sentence mentions other books, but they don't have James Kwak as a co-author. The other books are with Daron Acemoglu, Jonathan Gruber, and others. So the 2010 book is definitely *13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown*. \n\nThe citation for that sentence is [S27]. So the answer should be that title with the citation [S27]. I need to make sure there's no other possible answer. Let me double-check. The question specifies the year 2010, and the book mentioned here is indeed from 2010. Yes, that's correct."

Wait, so the 2013 book is mentioned here. But I need to check if this is the same individual. The sentence says \"He is also author of...\" which refers to the same person mentioned earlier. So [S1] mentions *White House Burning* as a 2013 book. \n\nThen [S2] also talks about the same books, confirming that *White House Burning* is from 2013. The other books are 2019 and 2023. So the 2013 book is *White House Burning: Our National Debt and Why It Matters to You*. \n\nBut wait, I need to make sure there's no other book in the context. Let me check the other sentences. [S3] talks about *Power and Progress* published in 2023, which is not relevant. The rest of the sentences [S4] to [S9] discuss the content of *Power and Progress*, so they don't mention the 2013 book. \n\nSo the answer should be *White House Burning: Our National Debt and Why It Matters to You*. The citation would be [S1] and [S2], since both mention this book. Wait, looking back, [S1] says \"He wrote the 2010 book... along with James Kwak... [S2] He is also author of *White House Burning: Our National Debt and Why It Matters to You* (2013);...\" So [S2] specifically mentions the 2013 book. Therefore, the correct citation is [S2]. But [S1] mentions the 2010 book, not the 2013 one. Wait, no, [S1] says \"He wrote the 2010 book... along with James Kwak, with whom he has also co-founded...

Therefore, the citation should be [S2]. \n\nBut maybe [S1] is also relevant? No, because [S1] is about the 2010 book. So the answer is *White House Burning: Our National Debt and Why It Matters to You* with citation [S2]. Let me check again. The question is about the 2013 book. The supporting context in [S2] explicitly states that. So the correct citation is [S2]. However, sometimes multiple sentences might refer to the same book. But in this case, only [S2] mentions the 2013 book. So the answer is [S2]."
