Let me check each sentence there.\n\nLooking at [S8]: \"Izza joined ICAEW in 2002 as executive director of finance and operations, becoming chief operating officer in 2004 and chief executive in 2006.\" That seems directly relevant. The sentence states that in 2006, he became chief executive. \n\nAre there any other sentences that mention his position in 2006? Let me check the rest. [S9] talks about 2008 and 2009, so not relevant. The other sentences in the ICAEW section are about his roles before 2006. \n\nSo the answer should be that he was the Chief Executive in 2006. The citation is [S8]. I need to make sure there's no other citation. The user's instructions say to cite the sentence numbers. So the statement would be \"Michael Izza held the position of Chief Executive at ICAEW in 2006.\" with the citation [S8]."

      "question": "What type of work does Michael Izza do with charities?",
      "answer": "<statement>Michael Izza is involved with charities as a trustee, having served on the trustee board of Moorfields Eye Charity, which supports Moorfields Eye Hospital.<cite>[S16]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking what type of work Michael Izza does with charities. I need to look through the supporting context provided and find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage for any mentions of charities or his involvement with them. The passage has several sections: Early life, Career, ICAEW, Personal life, etc. \n\nLooking at the \"Personal life\" section, there's a sentence that says, \"Izza has been a trustee of several charities, and is currently on the trustee board of Moorfields Eye Charity, which supports Moorfields Eye Hospital.\" That seems directly relevant. The sentence is numbered [S16]. \n\nAre there any other mentions? Let me check again. The ICAEW section talks about his roles in professional organizations, but not specifically charities. The rest of the sections detail his career in accounting and corporate roles. The key part is the trustee work with charities. \n\nSo the answer should mention that he is a trustee of several charities, specifically noting Moorfields Eye Charity. The citation would be [S16]. I need to make sure there's no other information elsewhere. The answer should be concise, citing the correct sentence."
