  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about the Bank of Pennsylvania in 3-5 sentences. Let me read through the content again to make sure I get the main points.\n\nThe document mentions two different banks. The first one was during the American Revolutionary War, started in 1780 by Thomas Paine to fund the Continental Army. It wasn't a traditional bank because it didn't lend money but acted as a purchasing agency. They raised £315,000, which helped after the Siege of Charleston, and it closed in 1784, replaced by the Bank of North America.\n\nThe second bank was chartered in 1793, had branches in several Pennsylvania cities, and collapsed in 1857. The president at the time was Thomas Allibone. Then in 1870, a column from its headquarters was moved to Michigan as a Civil War memorial.\n\nSo the main topics are the two different banks, their purposes, key events, and the legacy with the memorial. I need to highlight the two institutions, their roles, and the collapse and memorial. Keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Make sure to mention the Revolutionary War bank's role in funding the army, the 1793 bank's establishment and collapse, and the memorial. Avoid minor details like the exact dates of the siege or the number of soldiers, unless necessary. Focus on the main points: two banks, their purposes, key events, and the memorial.\n</think>\n\nThe **Bank of Pennsylvania** refers to two distinct institutions: the first, established during the American Revolutionary War in 1780, functioned as a purchasing agency to fund the Continental Army rather than a traditional bank, raising £315,000 in depreciated currency and supporting the war effort before dissolving in 1784. The second bank, chartered in 1793, operated with branches across Pennsylvania but collapsed in 1857, with its legacy preserved when a stone column from its headquarters was later erected as a Civil War memorial in Michigan. Both institutions highlight early financial challenges and historical milestones in American banking.",

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking who was the president of the second Bank of Pennsylvania during its collapse. The supporting context provided has two sections: the Revolutionary bank and the Chartered bank. The user is referring to the second one, which was chartered in 1793 and collapsed in 1857.\n\nLooking through the sentences, [S10] mentions that the Bank of Pennsylvania was established in 1793 with branches. Then [S11] says it collapsed in September 1857, and [S12] states that Thomas Allibone of the family firm Thomas Allibone & Co. was its president. So the answer should be Thomas Allibone. The citations would be [S11] and [S12], but since the question is about the president during collapse, the direct info is in [S12]. However, [S11] mentions the collapse, so maybe both are needed. Wait, the user wants citations for each sentence. The sentence stating the president would cite [S12], and the collapse date in [S11]. But the answer is Thomas Allibone, so the citation is [S12]. Let me check again. The exact sentence is \"Thomas Allibone of the family firm Thomas Allibone & Co. [S11] serving as its president. [S12]\" Wait, the structure in the context is [S11] and [S12]. So the collapse is in [S11], and the president is in [S12]. So the answer is Thomas Allibone, cited from [S12]. But maybe [S11] is also relevant because it mentions the collapse. However, the question is about the president during the collapse, so the president's name is in [S12]. So the correct citation is [S12]."
