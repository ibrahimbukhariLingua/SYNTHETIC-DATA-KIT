  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Jan Coene in 3-5 sentences. Let me read through the content again to make sure I get the main points.\n\nFirst, the document introduces Jan Coene as a Belgian businessman who became disgraced due to the Picanol Scandal. He started at BBC, then ABB, left in 2001 to become CEO of Picanol. Then he became Chairman of Belgacom, led to an IPO. In 2004, the press exposed his excessive income, leading to his resignation. He had to repay 10 million but kept 12. The scandal led to a law requiring transparency in executive pay. Also, he was part of the Vlerick-Boys network involved in other scandals, and he had to step down from some positions. Other roles include various board memberships and organizations.\n\nSo the main topic is his career and the scandal. Key concepts: Picanol scandal, excessive pay, resignation, political impact with the Picanol law, Vlerick-Boys network, and his other professional activities. I need to condense this into 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts. Avoid minor details like his family. Highlight the scandal, consequences, the law, and the network. Make sure it's concise and covers all important points without getting too detailed.\n</think>\n\nJan Coene, a Belgian businessman, rose to prominence as CEO of Picanol and chairman of Belgacom but fell from grace due to the Picanol Scandal, which exposed his excessive executive compensation and lack of transparency, leading to his resignation in 2004. The scandal prompted the \"Picanol law\" to mandate transparency in corporate executive pay and highlighted his ties to the Vlerick-Boys network, a group of influential but ethically questionable business figures. Despite his later roles in various boards and organizations, the scandal tarnished his reputation, forcing him to step down from leadership positions and repay part of his earnings. Coene's career underscores the intersection of corporate governance, political reform, and ethical controversies in Belgian business.",

[S2] As a young trainee, he joined Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC) Workshops in Brussels. [S3] In 1988, BBC merged with ASEA, to become ABB Asea Brown Boveri. [S4] In 2001 he left ABB and became the CEO & Chairman of Picanol, a world-wide leader in textile machinery and related services. [S5] In 2003, he became Chairman of Belgacom, the Belgian national telephone company which he led to an IPO, working closely with its owner, the Belgian Government. [S6] In 2004, the press revealed the level of his incomes from Picanol. [S7] These incomes were judged greatly excessive by the press, considering the usual Belgian remunerations for the functions of upper management. [S8] The lack of transparency was also pointed out, in particular by company's minority shareholders. [S9] Facing growing criticism, Jan Coene was forced to resign from both Picanol and Belgacom in October 2004. [S10] He accepted to reimburse ten million euros to Picanol (which because of the height of the sums reserved for Jan Coene had become financially unhealthy) but kept 12 million. [S11] The affair became a political issue in Belgium and a bill was introduced in Parliament (the \"Picanol law\") to force big companies to publish the remuneration of their upper management personnel. [S12] In the meanwhile, the affair also shed another bad light on the Network of Vlerick-Boys, a circle of business men with low moral standards who all studied at the Vlerick Management School. [S13] Members of the circle include Jan Coene, Ronald Everaert, Luc Debruyckere and Louis Verbeke, who were all implied in scandals of greed, mismanagement and fraud (Lernout & Hauspie, Ter Beke\u00a0[nl], Picanol). [S14] The circle entertains business connections and helps its members to get in the direction committees of Belgian industry. [S15] As one of the only remaining \"clean managers\" Jan Coene was named president of the alumni of the Vlerick Management School. [S16] But he also had to quit presidency after the 2004 Picanol scandal. [S17] Other of Jan Coene's professional activities include: Director and Board Member of various companies: Domo, Committee Koning Boudewijnstichting, Flanders, Federation of Flemish Enterprises, co-founder of BBE (Belgian Business for Europe), member of the World Economic Forum (since 2002), Chairman of Siveco Group SA, a company providing CMMS products worldwide.

I need to look through the provided supporting context to find that information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the passage. The first sentence in the chunk is [S1] \"Jan Coene\". That's his name, but probably not the full name. Then, in [S2], there's a mention of \"Jan Hugo Isidoor Coene\" which seems like the full name. The birth year is mentioned right after, \"born in 1957\". \n\nSo the full name is Jan Hugo Isidoor Coene, and the birth year is 1957. The citations for this would be [S2] because that's where both the full name and birth year are stated. I should check if there's any other sentence that mentions the birth year, but looking through the rest, [S2] is the only one. \n\nThe answer should be structured with each part in a statement, citing [S2] for both pieces of information.

Not much here.\n\n[S2] Talks about him joining Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC) as a trainee. But that's probably part of his early career, maybe not a role he held besides Picanol and Belgacom. But maybe BBC is a company he worked for before Picanol. However, the question is about roles besides Picanol and Belgacom, so if BBC is a different company, that might be a role. But I need to check if he held a position there. The sentence says he joined as a trainee, so maybe that's a role. But the user is asking for other roles besides Picanol and Belgacom. So maybe that's relevant. But I need to check if the answer includes that.\n\n[S3] Mentions the merger of BBC with ASEA to become ABB. So BBC was part of ABB. But does that count as a role? Maybe not directly. The sentence itself doesn't mention his role, just the merger.\n\n[S4] Says he left ABB in 2001 to become CEO and Chairman of Picanol. So Picanol is already mentioned, so that's not the answer.\n\n[S5] He became Chairman of Belgacom in 2003. Again, Belgacom is already mentioned in the question, so that's not the answer.\n\n[S6] About the press revealing his incomes from Picanol. Not relevant here.\n\n[S7] Talks about excessive incomes, again not relevant.\n\n[S8] Lack of transparency, same as above.\n\n[S9] Forced to resign from Picanol and Belgacom. Again, those are the two companies mentioned in the question.\n\n[S10] Reimbursing money to Picanol. Not relevant.\n\n[S11] The Picanol law introduced. Not a role.\n\n[S12] Mentions the Network of Vlerick-Boys, but not a role.\n\n[S13] Lists members of the circle, including Coene, but again, not a role.\n\n[S14] Talks about the network's connections, not a role.\n\n[S15] Says he was named president of the alumni of Vlerick Management School. That's a role. But he had to quit after the scandal. So this is a possible answer.\n\n[S16] He had to quit the presidency after the scandal. So that's another point, but the question is about other roles besides Picanol and Belgacom. So the presidency of the alumni is a role.\n\n[S17] This sentence is important. It says: \"Other of Jan Coene's professional activities include: Director and Board Member of various companies: Domo, Committee Koning Boudewijnstichting, Flanders, Federation of Flemish Enterprises, co-founder of BBE (Belgian Business for Europe), member of the World Economic Forum (since 2002), Chairman of Siveco Group SA, a company providing CMMS products worldwide.\" \n\nSo this list includes several roles. The question is asking for other roles besides Picanol and Belgacom. So all these positions mentioned here would be the answer. The sentence is [S17], so that's the citation. \n\n[S18] His personal life, not relevant.\n\n[S19] Links and references, not relevant.\n\nSo the answer should list the roles mentioned in [S17]. The user wants the statement with the answer and the citations. So the sentence would be something like \"Jan Coene held roles such as Director and Board Member of various companies including Domo, Committee Koning Boudewijnstichting, Flanders, Federation of Flemish Enterprises, co-founder of BBE, member of the World Economic Forum, and Chairman of Siveco Group SA.\" And the citation would be [S17].\n\nAdditionally, there's [S15] where he was president of the alumni of Vlerick Management School, but that's mentioned in [S15] and [S16]. However, the question is about professional roles. The alumni presidency might be considered a professional role. But the user's question is about roles besides Picanol and Belgacom. So if the answer includes that, then [S15] and [S16] would be citations. However, the main detailed list is in [S17]. \n\nBut the user's question is asking for \"other professional roles\", so both the presidency and the roles in [S17] would be relevant. However, the passage says \"Other of Jan Coene's professional activities include...\" in [S17], which lists multiple roles. So the answer should include those. The presidency in [S15] is another role. So maybe two sentences: one citing [S15] and [S17], but the user's answer format requires each sentence to have its own citations.\n\nWait, the user's example shows that each sentence is in its own <statement> tag. So if there are multiple roles, each can be in separate sentences. But the user's answer might need to combine them into one sentence or multiple. Let me check the instructions again.\n\nThe user says: \"answer the questions and provide citations of the sentence number. You must follow the format provided. Remember you must answer as correctly as you can.\"\n\nThe response format example shows two sentences, each with their own citations. So if there are multiple roles, each can be in separate statements. However, the answer might be more concise. Let me check the exact wording of the question again.\n\nThe question is: \"What other professional roles did Jan Coene hold besides Picanol and Belgacom?\"\n\nThe answer would be the roles listed in [S17], which includes Director and Board Member of various companies (Domo, Committee Koning Boudewijnstichting, Flanders, Federation of Flemish Enterprises), co-founder of BBE, member of the World Economic Forum, and Chairman of Siveco Group SA. Additionally, the presidency of the alumni of Vlerick Management School (from [S15] and [S16]).\n\nBut the passage says in [S15]: \"As one of the only remaining 'clean managers' Jan Coene was named president of the alumni of the Vlerick Management School.\" And [S16] says he had to quit after the scandal. So that's another role.\n\nSo the answer should include both the roles from [S17] and [S15]. However, the user's answer format requires each sentence to have its own citations. So perhaps two statements: one about the presidency and another about the roles in [S17]. But the user might expect the answer to be in one sentence. Alternatively, the answer could be a single sentence citing [S17] and [S15].\n\nBut looking at the supporting context, [S17] is the main sentence that lists the other roles. The presidency is mentioned in [S15], but maybe that's a separate role. So the answer would be:\n\n<statement>Jan Coene also served as president of the alumni of the Vlerick Management School and held roles such as Director and Board Member of various companies including Domo, Committee Koning Boudewijnstichting, Flanders, Federation of Flemish Enterprises, co-founder of BBE, member of the World Economic Forum, and Chairman of Siveco Group SA.<cite>[S15][S17]</cite></statement>\n\nBut I need to check if the presidency is considered a professional role. The passage says \"president of the alumni of the Vlerick Management School,\" which is an alumni association, so maybe that's more of a voluntary or honorary position. However, the question is about professional roles, so it's possible that it's included. Alternatively, the answer might focus on the roles listed in [S17], which are more clearly professional positions.\n\nBut the user's question is asking for \"other professional roles,\" so both the presidency and the roles in [S17] could be considered. However, the answer should be based on the context provided. Since [S17] explicitly lists \"professional activities,\" that's a clear source. The presidency in [S15] is also a role, but maybe not as professional. However, the passage doesn't specify, so it's safer to include both.\n\nBut the user's answer format requires each sentence to have its own citations. So if I make two statements, one citing [S15] and another citing [S17], but the user might expect a single answer. Alternatively, the answer can be a single statement that includes both, citing both [S15] and [S17].\n\nAlternatively, the answer could be:\n\n<statement>Jan Coene held other professional roles such as Director and Board Member of various companies, including Domo, Committee Koning Boudewijnstichting, Flanders, Federation of Flemish Enterprises, co-founder of BBE, member of the World Economic Forum, and Chairman of Siveco Group SA.<cite>[S17]</cite></statement>\n\nAnd another statement for the presidency:\n\n<statement>He also served as president of the alumni of the Vlerick Management School.<cite>[S15]</cite></statement>\n\nBut the user might prefer a single answer. However, the instructions don't specify, so I'll go with the most accurate answer based on the context. Since [S17] is the main source for the list of roles, and [S15] is another role, I'll include both."

[S7] These incomes were judged greatly excessive by the press, considering the usual Belgian remunerations for the functions of upper management.

[S9] Facing growing criticism, Jan Coene was forced to resign from both Picanol and Belgacom in October 2004. [S10] He accepted to reimburse ten million euros to Picanol (which because of the height of the sums reserved for Jan Coene had become financially unhealthy) but kept 12 million. [S11] The affair became a political issue in Belgium and a bill was introduced in Parliament (the \"Picanol law\") to force big companies to publish the remuneration of their upper management personnel. [S12] In the meanwhile, the affair also shed another bad light on the Network of Vlerick-Boys, a circle of business men with low moral standards who all studied at the Vlerick Management School. [S13] Members of the circle include Jan Coene, Ronald Everaert, Luc Debruyckere and Louis Verbeke, who were all implied in scandals of greed, mismanagement and fraud (Lernout & Hauspie, Ter Beke\u00a0[nl], Picanol). [S14] The circle entertains business connections and helps its members to get in the direction committees of Belgian industry.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking which international organization Jan Coene has been a member of since 2002. I need to look through the supporting context provided.\n\nLooking at the sentences, S17 mentions that he's a member of the World Economic Forum since 2002. The exact sentence is: \"member of the World Economic Forum (since 2002)\". So that's the key point here. \n\nI should check if there are any other organizations mentioned. The rest of the sentences talk about his roles in companies like Picanol, Belgacom, and others, but the World Economic Forum is the only international organization specified with the start year of 2002. \n\nSo the answer should be the World Economic Forum, cited from S17. No other sentences mention other organizations with that specific time frame. The other memberships like BBE (Belgian Business for Europe) are mentioned but without a start date. Therefore, the correct citation is S17."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking why Jan Coene had to resign as president of the Vlerick Management School alumni. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the sentences. Sentence S15 mentions that he was named president of the alumni, but then S16 says he had to quit after the 2004 Picanol scandal. The reason for his resignation is likely connected to that scandal. \n\nLooking at other sentences, S9 says he resigned from Picanol and Belgacom in October 2004 due to growing criticism. The scandal involved excessive income and lack of transparency, as mentioned in S6, S7, and S8. The Picanol law was introduced because of this, as per S11. Also, S12 and S13 mention the scandal shed bad light on the Vlerick-Boys network, which he was part of. \n\nSo, even though S15 says he became president, the resignation from the alumni presidency would be because of the same scandal that forced him to leave Picanol and Belgacom. The direct citation is S16, which states he had to quit after the 2004 scandal. Additionally, the context around S16 explains the scandal's impact, but the specific reason is the Picanol scandal. Therefore, the answer should cite S16 and possibly S9, S11, or S12/S13 for the context of the scandal. However, the exact reason for resigning as president is directly mentioned in S16. So the main citation is S16. But maybe S9 as well since it's about the resignation from the companies, which is part of the same event. However, the question is specifically about the alumni presidency, which is covered in S16. So the answer is S16."
