  "summary": "<think>\nOkay, I need to summarize this document about Enterprise Florida in 3-5 sentences. Let me start by reading through the content carefully.\n\nThe main topic is Enterprise Florida, Inc. (EFI), which was a public-private partnership focused on economic development in Florida. Their mission was to expand the economy through job creation, working with a network of partners and funded by both the state and private businesses. They had various services like recruiting companies, assisting expansions, international trade, small business support, and military and sports initiatives.\n\nThe document mentions that in 2023, EFI was dissolved, and its programs were transferred to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, now the Florida Department of Commerce. There's also a history section noting that Florida was the first state to create such a partnership in 1996 under Governor Chiles, which influenced other states. The leadership structure included a board with 59 members, and key services like competitive project development, international trade offices, small business capital programs, the Florida Defense Alliance, and the Florida Sports Foundation.\n\nI need to highlight the main points: what EFI was, its mission, structure, key services, and the dissolution in 2023. Also, mention the historical context and the transfer of programs. Avoid minor details like specific dates unless they're crucial. Make sure to keep it concise, 3-5 sentences. Let me check if I missed anything important. The fact that they didn't disclose donors is a detail, but maybe not essential for the summary. The key is the dissolution and transfer. Also, the creation of SelectFlorida as a new entity. Okay, I think that's covered. Now, structure the sentences to flow logically, starting with the organization's purpose, then its structure and services, followed by the dissolution and transfer.\n</think>\n\nEnterprise Florida, Inc. (EFI) was a public-private partnership established in 1996 to drive Florida's economic growth through job creation, international trade, and business development, operating as a model for state-led economic initiatives. It provided services like company recruitment, small business support, military base advocacy, and sports event promotion, while maintaining a network of international offices and collaborating with local partners. In 2023, EFI was dissolved, with its programs transferred to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, marking a shift in the state's economic development strategy. The organization's legacy includes fostering a diverse economy and influencing other states to adopt similar public-private models.",

Then [S2] says \"EFI\u2019s mission was to expand and diversify the state\u2019s economy through job creation.\" That seems like the direct answer. \n\nI should check if there are other sentences that mention the mission. [S21] also talks about the goal to expand and diversify the economy through job creation, but it's probably repeating the same info as [S2]. The question is about the mission, so [S2] is the key sentence. \n\nAre there any other citations? The user wants citations in the format [Sx]. So the answer should be based on [S2]. I don't see any other sentences that define the mission. The rest of the context talks about history, leadership, services, etc., but not the mission statement. \n\nSo the correct answer is the sentence from [S2], and no other citations are needed. The user's example shows that each sentence is in <statement> tags with citations. So the response should be a statement with [S2] cited."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking, \"What type of organization was Enterprise Florida?\" and they provided a supporting context. My job is to find the answer in the given text and cite the correct sentences.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the passage to find mentions of Enterprise Florida's type. The first sentence in the chunk is \"Enterprise Florida\" but that's just the name. Then, looking at sentence S1: it says \"Enterprise Florida, Inc. (EFI) was a public\u2013private partnership between Florida\u2019s business and government leaders and was the principal economic development organization for the state of Florida.\" That seems like a key point. \n\nAnother part is in S16: \"With the creation of EFI, Florida became the first state to convert its Department of Commerce into a 501(c)(3) public-private partnership in which business has a leadership role.\" So that confirms it's a public-private partnership. Also, S2 mentions it's the principal economic development organization. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other relevant sentences. S14 talks about the Board of Directors, but that's more about leadership. The answer should combine that it's a public-private partnership and the principal economic development org. So the main citations would be S1 and S16. Let me check if other sentences add more. S3 mentions it's funded by both state and private sectors, which supports the public-private aspect. But the question is about the type of organization, so S1 and S16 are the most direct. \n\nI should structure the answer with the statement and cite those sentences. Let me make sure I'm not missing any other parts. The answer is straightforward from S1 and S16. Alright, that should do it."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking what services Enterprise Florida provided to support its mission. The supporting context is given, so I need to look through that.\n\nFirst, I'll check the sections of the passage. There's a section titled \"Key services\" which probably lists the services. Let me read that part. \n\nIn the \"Key services\" section, it says EFI's goal is to expand and diversify Florida's economy through job creation. Then there's a list of services: recruiting companies, assisting business expansions, facilitating international trade, providing capital funding for small and minority businesses, advocating for military bases, and promoting sporting events. \n\nI need to make sure these are the services mentioned. Also, check if there are other sections that mention services. The \"Competitive project business development\" section talks about assisting companies with location, relocation, expansion, site selection, demographic info, incentives. But that might be part of the \"Key services\" list. \n\nThe question is about services, so the answer should include all the points from the \"Key services\" bullet points. Each of these points should be cited with their respective sentence numbers. Let me check the sentence numbers for each bullet point. \n\nThe first bullet under \"Key services\" is \"Recruits companies...\" which is S21. Then the next points are part of the same paragraph. Wait, the passage shows the key services as a list, but the sentence numbers might be different. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the passage: \n\nUnder \"Key services\", the first sentence is \"EFI's goal is to expand and diversify Florida's economy through job creation.\" [S21]. Then the list starts. However, the list items themselves might not have separate citations. Wait, the original passage's \"Key services\" section has the list items without explicit citations. But the user's context might have citations. Wait, the user's supporting context is provided as chunks with sentence numbers. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the supporting context provided:\n\nThe \"Key services\" section starts with \"EFI's goal is to expand and diversify Florida's economy through job creation. [S21] In support of this mission, EFI: ...\". Then the list follows. But the list items themselves don't have citations. However, the sentence after the list is [S22], which is about competitive project business development. So the list items might not have their own citations. But the user's question is about the services, so the answer would need to reference the sentences where the services are mentioned.\n\nWait, the user's context has the \"Key services\" paragraph as:\n\n\"EFI's goal is to expand and diversify Florida's economy through job creation. [S21] In support of this mission, EFI:\n\n* Recruits companies from all over the world to locate in Florida\n* Assists with the expansion of established businesses in Florida\n* Facilitates international trade and exporting\n* Provides capital funding programs to assist small and minority businesses\n* Advocates for the protection of Florida's military bases\n* Promotes professional and amateur sporting events throughout the state\"\n\nBut the sentence numbers here are only [S21] for the first sentence. The list items themselves don't have citations. However, the next section starts with \"### Competitive project business development\" and the sentence [S22] is about that. So maybe the services listed under \"Key services\" are all part of the same paragraph, and the citations are only on the first sentence. But the user's question is about the services, so the answer should include those bullet points, but since they don't have their own citations, maybe they are all under [S21]. But that might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe the services are part of the same sentence as the goal. However, the user's instructions say to cite the sentence numbers where the information is present. If the services are listed in the same paragraph as [S21], then perhaps they are all part of that sentence. But the way the passage is structured, the bullet points are part of the same paragraph. However, in the original text, each bullet point might be a separate sentence. But in the given context, the user's passage shows the bullet points as part of the same paragraph without separate sentence numbers. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The user's supporting context might have the bullet points as part of the same sentence. So, for example, the first sentence is [S21], and the bullet points are part of that sentence. Therefore, all the services listed would be cited as [S21]. However, if the bullet points are separate sentences, but the user's context doesn't assign them numbers, then they can't be cited. But according to the given context, the only citation in that section is [S21]. \n\nSo, the answer would need to list the services from the bullet points, each as a separate statement, and cite [S21] for each. But the user's instructions require that each sentence in the answer has citations. So, each bullet point would be a separate statement, and each would be cited as [S21]. \n\nAlternatively, if the bullet points are considered part of the same sentence, then they can be grouped. But the user's response format requires each sentence to be in <statement> tags. So each bullet point would be a separate statement. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be:\n\n<statement>Recruits companies from all over the world to locate in Florida.<cite>[S21]</cite></statement>\n<statement>Assists with the expansion of established businesses in Florida.<cite>[S21]</cite></statement>\n<statement>Facilitates international trade and exporting.<cite>[S21]</cite></statement>\n<statement>Provides capital funding programs to assist small and minority businesses.<cite>[S21]</cite></statement>\n<statement>Advocates for the protection of Florida's military bases.<cite>[S21]</cite></statement>\n<statement>Promotes professional and amateur sporting events throughout the state.<cite>[S21]</cite></statement>\n\nBut I need to check if there are other citations. For example, the \"Competitive project business development\" section has [S22] and [S23], but those might be additional services. The passage under \"Competitive project business development\" says EFI confidentially assists companies with location, relocation, expansion, etc., and job creation efforts in various sectors. However, the user's question is about the services provided, so those might be part of the services listed. But the original \"Key services\" list already includes recruiting companies and assisting expansions. So maybe the \"Competitive project business development\" is part of the same services. However, the user's question is about the services, so perhaps those details are part of the services mentioned in the \"Key services\" section. \n\nBut since the user's context has the \"Key services\" list with [S21], and the other sections have different citations, I should stick to the citations provided. Therefore, the answer would include the bullet points with [S21]. \n\nAnother thing to check: the user's question is about services to support its mission. The mission is job creation, as per [S2], and the services listed in [S21] are the ones supporting that. So the answer is correct."

      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the key activities of Enterprise Florida (EFI) as outlined in the text. I need to go through the supporting context provided and pick out the relevant points.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial chunk under \"In support of this mission, EFI:\" there's a list of activities. Let me check each bullet point. The first bullet says they recruit companies from around the world to locate in Florida. That's one activity. The second is assisting with the expansion of established businesses. Third is facilitating international trade and exporting. Fourth, providing capital funding for small and minority businesses. Fifth, advocating for military bases protection. Sixth, promoting sporting events. So those are all listed in S1.\n\nThen there's a section on competitive project business development. It mentions EFI works with 67 economic development offices, etc., helping companies with location, relocation, expansion. They provide site selection, demographic info, incentives. That's part of their activities. Also, their job creation efforts focus on various industries like life sciences, IT, aviation, etc. So that's more details on their business development activities. That's from S2 and S3.\n\nNext, the international trade section. The text says EFI helps businesses expand internationally with export counseling, trade missions, financial assistance for events, research reports. They have 14 international offices in 13 countries, with 12 full-service ones in places like Brazil, Canada, France, etc. These offices help with selling products, representing Florida overseas, attracting investment. Also, pro bono offices in Czech Republic and Taiwan. That's from S4 to S9.\n\nSmall business capital programs: EFI's MaSBEC division partners with organizations to provide training, development, financing. They have a network of state, federal, and non-profit resources to help small businesses access capital, enter markets, grow. That's S10 and S11.\n\nFlorida Defense Alliance (FDA) is mentioned as a non-profit partnership, but the question is about EFI's activities. However, the text says FDA's mission is part of EFI's activities? Wait, the section starts with \"Florida Defense Alliance (FDA) was created...\" but it's part of the supporting context. However, the user is asking about EFI's activities. The text says \"EFI's stated mission is to assist...\" in the international trade section. But the FDA section might be part of EFI's activities? Wait, the text under \"Florida Defense Alliance\" says FDA was created as a non-profit partnership between various officials, but it's not clear if FDA is part of EFI. However, the user's question is about EFI's key activities. The initial list in S1 includes \"Advocates for the protection of Florida's military bases,\" which might relate to the FDA. But the FDA section is separate. Maybe the key activity here is the advocacy part from S1, and the FDA is a separate entity. But the user might need to know if EFI is involved with FDA. The text says \"Florida Defense Alliance (FDA) was created...\" but it's not explicitly stated that FDA is under EFI. However, the next section is about the Florida Sports Foundation joining EFI. So maybe the FDA is part of EFI's activities? The question is about EFI's key activities as outlined. The initial list in S1 includes advocating for military bases, which is part of EFI's activities. The FDA section might be an example of how they advocate, but the exact connection isn't clear. Maybe the key activity is the advocacy, and the FDA is a separate entity. But the user might need to include that. Hmm.\n\nThen the Florida Sports Foundation joined EFI in 2011. Their mission is to assist communities with sporting events, generate economic impact, etc. So promoting sports events is part of EFI's activities. That's from S14 and S15.\n\nSo compiling all these points, the key activities would be:\n\n1. Recruiting companies to locate in Florida.\n2. Assisting expansion of existing businesses.\n3. Facilitating international trade and exporting.\n4. Providing capital funding for small and minority businesses.\n5. Advocating for military bases protection.\n6. Promoting sporting events.\n7. Competitive project business development (site selection, demographic info, incentives, job creation in various sectors).\n8. International trade initiatives (export counseling, trade missions, offices in multiple countries).\n9. Small business capital programs (training, financing, resources).\n10. Possibly involvement with Florida Defense Alliance (though not entirely clear if it's part of EFI's activities, but the initial list includes advocating for military bases, which might be covered under that).\n\nNow, I need to map each of these to the correct sentence numbers. The initial list in S1 covers points 1-6. Then the competitive project business development is S2 and S3. The international trade section has S4-S9. Small business capital is S10-S11. The Florida Defense Alliance is S12-S13, but not sure if that's part of EFI's activities. The sports foundation is S14-S15.\n\nSo the answer should list each activity with their citations. For example, recruiting companies is S1. Assisting expansion is S1. Facilitating trade is S1. Providing capital is S1. Advocating for military bases is S1. Promoting sports is S1. Then the competitive project part is S2 and S3. International trade details are S4-S9. Small business capital is S10-S11. The Florida Sports Foundation's role is S14-S15. The FDA's mission might be part of the advocacy in S1, but since the question is about EFI's activities, maybe the FDA is a separate entity. However, the initial list in S1 includes \"advocates for the protection of Florida's military bases,\" which could be related to the FDA's mission. But the text doesn't explicitly say that FDA is part of EFI. So maybe the key activity is the advocacy part from S1, and the FDA is a separate entity. Therefore, the answer should include the points from S1, S2, S3, S4-S9, S10-S11, S14-S15.\n\nSo each activity needs to be a separate statement with the correct citations. For example:\n\n- Recruiting companies: [S1]\n- Assisting expansion: [S1]\n- Facilitating trade: [S1]\n- Providing capital: [S1]\n- Advocating for military bases: [S1]\n- Promoting sports: [S1]\n- Competitive project business development: [S2][S3]\n- International trade initiatives: [S4][S5][S6][S7][S8][S9]\n- Small business capital programs: [S10][S11]\n- Promoting sports events via FSF: [S14][S15]\n\nBut need to check if each activity is correctly cited. For example, the international trade section's points are covered in S4-S9. The competitive project part is S2 and S3. The sports foundation is S14 and S15. The FDA's part might not be directly part of EFI's activities unless specified. The initial list in S1 includes advocating for military bases, which is a key activity. So that's [S1].\n\nSo the final answer would list each of these activities with their respective citations."

The \"International trade and development\" section talks about exporters but not specific sectors.

      "thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about EFI's mission regarding international trade and exporting. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the sections of the passage. There's a section titled \"International trade and development\" which seems directly relevant. Let me check that. \n\nIn that section, sentence [S4] mentions that Florida has over 60,000 exporters, second highest in the US. But the question is about EFI's mission, not just the number of exporters. Then, [S5] states EFI's mission is to assist Florida businesses in expanding into the international marketplace. The specific actions listed here include export counseling, overseas trade missions, trade shows, financial assistance for events, and research reports. \n\nAnother part is [S6], which talks about EFI's network of 14 international offices in 13 countries. The next sentences [S7] and [S8] detail the services provided by these offices, like assisting companies to sell products abroad and attracting foreign investment. [S9] mentions pro bono offices in Czech Republic and Taiwan. \n\nSo the main points are the assistance with export counseling, trade missions, financial aid for events, research, and the network of international offices. The answer should compile these elements. \n\nI need to make sure to cite the correct sentences. [S5] directly states the mission, and [S6]-[S8] elaborate on the methods. Also, [S4] provides context about the number of exporters, but maybe that's not directly part of the mission. The user wants the mission, so [S5] is key. The other sentences support how they achieve the mission. \n\nSo the answer would be that EFI's mission is to assist Florida businesses in expanding into the international marketplace through counseling, trade missions, financial assistance, and research. The citations would be [S5], and maybe [S6][S7][S8] for the details about the international offices. Wait, the question is about the mission, so maybe only [S5] is necessary. But the user might want the supporting details. Let me check the example response format. The example had a sentence with citations. So perhaps the main statement is from [S5], and then other sentences that add details. But the user's question is specifically about the mission, so the primary citation is [S5]. However, the supporting context in [S6]-[S8] might be part of the mission's execution. But the question is about the mission itself, not the methods. So maybe just [S5]. But the user might expect the answer to include the methods as part of the mission description. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be structured as a statement citing [S5], and then another statement about the international offices citing [S6][S7][S8]. But the question is about the mission, so the main answer is [S5]. Let me confirm. The passage says \"EFI's stated mission is to assist Florida businesses...\" so that's the direct answer. The rest is how they do it. So the answer should be based on [S5], and maybe [S6]-[S8] if they are part of the mission. But the mission is the overall goal, while the offices are part of the strategy. So the answer is from [S5], and the citations would be [S5]. However, the user might want all relevant parts. Let me check the exact wording of the question again: \"What is EFI's mission regarding international trade and exporting?\" So the answer is in [S5], which mentions assisting businesses in expanding into the international marketplace by providing export counseling, overseas trade missions, etc. Therefore, the statement should be based on [S5], and the citation is [S5]. But the user might also want the part about the international offices, but those are part of the methods, not the mission statement itself. So the correct citation is [S5]."

      "answer": "<statement>Enterprise Florida maintains a network of 14 International Offices in 13 countries whose markets offer important trade and/or investment opportunities for Florida.<cite>[S6]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking how many International Offices Enterprise Florida maintains and in how many countries.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the supporting context provided. The user mentioned that each sentence is tagged with [S1], [S2], etc. So I should scan through those sentences to find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the section titled \"International trade and development,\" there's a chunk that says: \"Enterprise Florida maintains a network of 14 International Offices in 13 countries whose markets offer important trade and/or investment opportunities for Florida.\" That seems directly relevant. So the number of offices is 14, and the number of countries is 13. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of this elsewhere. For example, the next sentence says there are twelve full-service offices in specific countries, and two pro bono offices in the Czech Republic and Taiwan. But the initial statement about 14 offices in 13 countries seems to be the total. The twelve full-service plus two pro bono would add up to 14, and the countries mentioned in the list would be 12 plus 2 more (Czech Republic and Taiwan), making 14 countries. Wait, but the first sentence says 13 countries. Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check again.\n\nThe sentence [S6] says 14 International Offices in 13 countries. Then [S7] lists 12 countries (Brazil, Canada (two cities), France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Spain, U.K.) \u2013 that's 11 countries, but Canada is counted as one country with two offices. So maybe Canada is one country, so the list is 12 countries. Then [S8] mentions Pro bono offices in Czech Republic and Taiwan, adding two more countries. That would make 12 + 2 = 14 countries, but the initial statement says 13. Wait, maybe there's an overlap or a mistake. But according to the text, [S6] explicitly states 13 countries. So perhaps the list in [S7] and [S8] includes 13 countries. Let me count again:\n\n[S7] lists Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Spain, UK. That's 11 countries. Then [S8] adds Czech Republic and Taiwan, making 13. So the 12 full-service offices are in those 11 + 2? Wait, no. The 12 full-service offices are in the listed countries, which are 11 (if Canada is one) plus the two pro bono in Czech Republic and Taiwan. But [S6] says 14 offices in 13 countries. So 12 full-service and 2 pro bono, totaling 14. The countries would be 12 (from the list in [S7]) plus 2 (Czech Republic and Taiwan) but maybe one of the countries in [S7] is counted as two? Wait, Canada is listed as Toronto and Montreal, but it's still one country. So the 12 full-service offices are in 12 countries, and the two pro bono in two more, totaling 14 countries. But [S6] says 13. Maybe there's an error in the context, but as per the given text, [S6] is the direct answer. So the answer is 14 offices in 13 countries, citing [S6]. The other sentences might support it but the exact numbers are in [S6]."

      "question": "What is the mission of the Florida Defense Alliance (FDA)?",
      "answer": "<statement>The Florida Defense Alliance (FDA) was created in 1998 as a non-profit partnership between the Governor, Florida state officials, the Florida Congressional Delegation, state legislators, base commanders and staff, community leaders, and business executives.<cite>[S12]</cite></statement> <statement>FDA's mission is to increase military value, enhance base capabilities, and promote multi-service synergies for Florida\u2019s military bases, while supporting and enhancing the quality of life of Florida military families.<cite>[S13]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking about the mission of the Florida Defense Alliance (FDA). I need to find the relevant part in the provided supporting context.\n\nLooking through the chunks, there's a section titled \"Florida Defense Alliance\". The sentence there says: \"FDA's mission is to increase military value, enhance base capabilities, and promote multi-service synergies for Florida\u2019s military bases, while supporting and enhancing the quality of life of Florida military families.\" That seems to directly answer the question. \n\nI should check if there are any other mentions of FDA's mission elsewhere. The rest of the context talks about other organizations like EFI, International Trade, Small Business programs, and the Florida Sports Foundation. Nothing else about FDA. \n\nSo the answer is in sentence S13. The citation should be [S13]. The statement should be the exact sentence from the context. Let me make sure I'm not missing any other sentences. The chunk starts with \"Florida Defense Alliance\" and the next sentence is S12, which mentions the creation of FDA, but the actual mission is in S13. Yep, that's the one."

The citation here is [S14]. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of the Florida Sports Foundation elsewhere, but the rest of the context talks about FSF's mission and activities, not the joining date. The other sentences in that section are about their mission and programs. So the key sentence is definitely [S14]. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2011, cited from [S14]."
