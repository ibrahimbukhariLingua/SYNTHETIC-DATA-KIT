Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.\n\nThe main points are that Orb Energy is a solar energy company based in Bangalore, founded in 2006 by Damian Miller and NP Ramesh. They started with a branch in Kumta and expanded to 100 branches in Karnataka by 2015. Then they expanded to Africa in 2014, setting up a subsidiary in Kenya to replicate their Indian business model.\n\nSo the key elements are the company's origin, founders, location, expansion in India, and then international expansion into Africa. I should make sure to mention the years and the key milestones. Also, the fact that they have a subsidiary in Kenya is important. I need to keep it concise, so maybe combine the expansion details into a couple of sentences. Avoid any extra details not mentioned. Check for clarity and that all main topics are covered.\n</think>\n\nOrb Energy is a solar energy company based in Bangalore, India, founded in 2006 by Damian Miller and NP Ramesh. It expanded rapidly in India, reaching 100 branches in Karnataka by 2015, starting with its first branch in Kumta. The company later extended its operations to Africa in 2014, establishing a subsidiary in Kenya to replicate its successful Indian business model. Its focus on solar energy and regional expansion highlights its growth strategy and commitment to renewable energy solutions.",

Let me check the supporting context provided.\n\nLooking at the passage, the first sentence mentions that Orb Energy was founded by Damian Miller and NP Ramesh in 2006. Then, in sentence S2, it again states that the company was founded in 2006 by those two people in Bangalore, India. The other sentences talk about later events like opening branches, reaching 100 branches by 2015, and starting operations in Africa in 2014. \n\nSo the key point here is the founding year. The question is specifically about 2006, which is when the company was established. The answer should highlight that 2006 is the year of founding. The citations needed would be S1 and S2 since both mention the founding in 2006. Wait, but the user's passage has [S1] as the first sentence, which says \"Orb Energy\" and then the next sentence is [S2] which states the founding. So the correct citations would be [S1] and [S2]? Wait, looking again:\n\nThe first chunk starts with [S1] \"Orb Energy\" followed by a heading. Then [S2] says \"Orb Energy was founded in 2006...\" So the founding year is mentioned in [S2]. But the first sentence [S1] just mentions the company's name. So maybe the answer should cite [S2] only? But the user's question is about the significance of 2006, which is the founding year. So the correct citation is [S2]. However, sometimes the founding date might be in the first sentence, but here [S1] is just the company name. So the answer is that 2006 is the founding year, cited from [S2]. But let me check again. The user's passage:\n\n[S1] Orb Energy\n\n# Orb Energy\n\n\n\n**Orb Energy** is a solar energy company headquartered in Bangalore, India, founded by Damian Miller and NP Ramesh in 2006. [S2] ## History\n\nOrb Energy was founded in 2006 by Damian Miller and NP Ramesh in Bangalore, India. [S3] The company opened its first branch in Kumta, India. [S4] The company reached 100 branches in Karnataka by 2015. [S5] Orb Energy started its operations in Africa in 2014. [S6] The company launched its own subsidiary in Kenya to replicate its Indian Business model in Africa.\n\nSo [S1] is just the company name. Then [S2] is the first sentence under the History section, which states the founding in 2006. So the answer should be that 2006 is the founding year, cited from [S2]. However, the first sentence in the passage (S1) might not have the date. Wait, the first sentence after the heading is [S2], which says \"Orb Energy was founded in 2006...\" So the correct citation is [S2]. Therefore, the answer is that the significance of 2006 is that Orb Energy was founded that year, citing [S2]."

      "question": "What is the location of Orb Energy's headquarters?",
      "answer": "<statement>Orb Energy is a solar energy company headquartered in Bangalore, India, founded by Damian Miller and NP Ramesh in 2006.<cite>[S1]</cite></statement>",
      "thinking": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the location of Orb Energy's headquarters. I need to look through the provided supporting context to find that information.\n\nLooking at the first sentence in the chunk, [S1] says \"Orb Energy\" is a solar energy company headquartered in Bangalore, India. So that seems to directly answer the question. The next sentences talk about the history, founding in 2006, branches in Kumta, and expansion to Africa. But the key part here is the first sentence. \n\nI should check if there are any other sentences that mention the headquarters. [S2] mentions the founding in Bangalore, but the headquarters is already stated in [S1]. The rest of the sentences [S3] to [S6] talk about branches and expansions, not the main headquarters. \n\nSo the answer should be Bangalore, India, cited from [S1]. I need to make sure there's no other conflicting information. No, everything else is about branches and expansions. So the correct citation is [S1]."

The other sentences talk about reaching 100 branches in Karnataka by 2015, starting operations in Africa in 2014, and a subsidiary in Kenya. But the first branch is specifically mentioned in [S3] as Kumta. So the answer should be Kumta, India. The citation would be [S3]."

The supporting context provided has several sentences.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the sentences to find the answer. Let's go through each one. \n\n[S1] talks about Orb Energy being a solar company in Bangalore, founded by certain people. Not directly relevant to the state with 100 branches. \n\n[S2] is about the history, same as S1, maybe redundant. \n\n[S3] mentions the first branch in Kumta, India. But Kumta is a town, not a state. \n\n[S4] says the company reached 100 branches in Karnataka by 2015. Karnataka is a state in India. That seems like the answer. \n\n[S5] and [S6] talk about operations in Africa and a subsidiary in Kenya, which is not relevant here. \n\nSo the key sentence is [S4], which states that Karnataka is the state with 100 branches by 2015. The answer should be Karnataka, cited from [S4]."
