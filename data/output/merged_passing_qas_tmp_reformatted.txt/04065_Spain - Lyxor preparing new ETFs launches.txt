Spain - Lyxor preparing new ETFs launches


Cinco Días interviews Adrión Juliá, director of publicly-traded products at Société Générale, who says that Lyxor is planning to launch more ETF products on the Spanish market, as well as products based on corporate bonds. But the management firm is waiting for a change in regulations which will allow ETFs to be registered as Sicav funds instead of having to be registered as investment funds, which will then allow the ETF products to be traded without being subject to withholding flat tax.
