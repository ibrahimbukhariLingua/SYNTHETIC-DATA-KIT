J. Chahine Capital launches a new small and midcaps fund


The boutique J. Chahine Capital, a speicalist in quantitative management based in Luxembourg, has announced the launch of a new equity fund, entitled Digital Stars Europe Smaller Companies, focused on small and midcaps. The launch aims to meet “demand from several of our subscribers,” the firm says on its website. “Our flagship fund, Digital Stars Europe, is a fund which imposes minimal capitalisation and liquidity constraints as a result of the size of its assets,” the firm says. “Some of our clients would like to hedge their Small/Mid Cap allocation, excluding shares of over EUR5bn. Our new fund meets this need, and its sizes makes it possible to select small caps which do not belong in our current fund.” Concretely, the new fund will be able to select smaller companies by lowering the liquidity threshold to an average daily trading volume of EUR500,000, compared with EUR2bm for the Stars Europe fund. Initial subscriptions to the new fund will be open until 16 December, J. Chahine Capital says in a statement, and hopes to be able to start with EUR5m of seed money. “The capacity of the fund is about EUR200m,” the asset management firm says. The management of the new vehicle will be carried out by Julien Bernier, chief investment officer, and his team. The ohjective for the fund is to earn long-term capital gains on its capital and to outperform the European small cap markets “via the use of a sophisticated quantitative model to identify ‘star’ performers,” J. Chahine Capital says. Its investment universe includes about 1,500 stocks from the European Union, Switzerland and Norway. The fund is currently available for sale in Luxembourg, and is pending permission from regulators in France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, Austria and Spain.
