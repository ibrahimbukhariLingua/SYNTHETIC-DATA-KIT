Harbinger analyst to launch his own firm


Lawrence M. Clark Jr left Harbinger Capital Partners where he was a senior analyst and a partner to launch his own hedge fund, The Wall Street Journal writes. This departure comes as Harbinger in recent years has evolved from a diversified hedge-fund firm to one which looks more like a private-equity firm. Assets have declined from about USD26 billion in 2008 to USD6.4 billion in November.
