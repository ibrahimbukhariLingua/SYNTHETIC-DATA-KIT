UBP launches an ESG bond fund dedicated to emerging markets


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } Union Bancaire Privée (UBP) has announced in a statement that it is launching a new fund: UBAM – EM Sustainable High Grade Corporate Bond. The offering covers emerging markets, and meets environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. “Like their counterparts in developed markets, many corporate issuers in emerging markets have strengthened their ESG practices. This new fund aims to privilege leading companies in this area, and reflects a desire on the part of UBP to offer a range of top calibre ESG investments, in light of the growing popularity of this type of solutions with our clients,” says Denis Girault, head of the emerging market bond team at ESG, which will manage the strategy. The MSCI ESG Research LLC company will provide UBP with a screening approach that is both quantitative and qualitative, and will assist investment grade emerging market corporate debt issuers with high ESG ratings. In addition to identifying issuers who outperform their peers in ESG considerations, the screening process for the fund makes it possible to exclude companies in certain sectors which have a negative impact on sustainable development. The portfolio is composed of 50 issuers in 20 countries. The range of bond funds in emerging markets already includes three corporate bond strategies (UBAM – EM Investment Grade Corporate Bond, UBAM - Emerging Market Corporate Bond, et UBAM - EM High Yield Short Duration Corporate Bond), and also a government bond strategy (UBAM - Emerging Market Sovereign Bond), as well as an unconstrained strategy, which is not constrained to a benchmark, and is very flexible in terms of the management of its exposures (UBAM - Emerging Market Debt Opportunities). The new fund is available to investors in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Sweden, and Switzerland.
