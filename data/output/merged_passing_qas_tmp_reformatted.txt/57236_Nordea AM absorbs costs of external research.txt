Nordea Asset Management will absorb the costs of external research when MiFID 2 comes into effect, the Swedish website realtid.se reports, citing Nyhetsbyrån Direkt. “Covering the costs of internal and external analysis will allow us to be transparent with our clients, and to make their investment decisions more easily,” says Nils Bolmstrand, CEO of Nordea Asset Management.
