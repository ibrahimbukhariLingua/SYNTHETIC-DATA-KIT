CIO at PGGM departs


Johan van der Ende is stepping down as chief investment officer at PGGM, the administrative organisation for collective pension schemes in the Netherlands, principally in the care and welfare sector. The decision has been made by mutual agreement. “It has become clear in recent months that the mutual expectations within the executive committee would impede successful co-operation”, says a press release. Johan van der Ende has worked at PGGM since mid-2006, for the past two years as CIO. He became a member of the newly formed executive committee on 1 January 2010. He will leave PGGM on 1 November. His duties will be assumed on a temporary basis by Jac Kragt, who has been with PGGM since 2008.
