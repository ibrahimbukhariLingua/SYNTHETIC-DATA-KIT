Women have more appetite for alternative assets than men


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Alternative management seems to repel masculine genes. 60% of women in the US, who would ordinarily be expected to be the most hesitant to take risks, estimate that alternative vehicles are expected to represent an essential part of their portfolios in the next five to 10 years, according to research conducted by the invetment firm MainStay Investments. Women who invest in alternative assets do so with a long-term outlook, in order to promote the long-term growth of their capital, as well as to generate returns and to benefit from diversification in their portfolios. They dedicate an average of 27% of their portfolios to alternative management, compared with only 20% for men. They do not hesistate to seek advice from an adviser to inform their consideration of alternative strategies. 65% do so, compared with 58% of men. They appreciate information about the potential risks of such investments (69%) the functioning of these investments (66%), and their potential impact on returns (52%). The conclusion of MainStay Investments, whose assets under management totalled more than USD105bn as of 30 June 2014, is that wommen represent a “tremendous opportunity” for growth. This area for growth may have been neglected in the past.
