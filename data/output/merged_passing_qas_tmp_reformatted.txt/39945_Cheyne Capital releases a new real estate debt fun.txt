Cheyne Capital releases a new real estate debt fund


Cheyne Capital Management, a London-based alternative asset mangement firm with USD6.5bn in assets under management, has launched a new fund dedicated to real estate debt. The vehicle, entitled Cheyne Real Estate Credit Holdings Fund III (CRECH III), is intended to “capitalise on the ongoing dislocation on European real estate debt markets and to meet growing demand for real estate financing,” the firm says in a statement. Like the first two funds of the same nature, CRECH III will invest in European “core” real estate markets, specifically the United Kingdom and Germany, via a wide range of instruments (CMBS, senior loans, mezzanine loans, equities and special situations). The team dedicated to real estate at Cheyne Capital Management currently manages over USD2bn in public and private funds.
