Asian hedge funds interest institutionals


Investment in hedge funds by institutionals is expected to remain stable in the next three years, according to a study by Ernst & Young sited by Asian Investor. Only 17% of respondents to the survey (out of 65 institutionals managing a total of USD190bn), have said they expect an increase in their allocation to this asset class, compared with 72% who say they would like to maintain the same level of exposure, and 11% who would like to reduce it. The reasons cited as preventing them from increasing their exposure to hedge funds are largely the costs and the disappointing past performance. In the short term, Asian hedge funds are expected to benefit from a rise in interest in their region on the part of institutional investors who would like to benefit from strong Asian growth, Ernst & Young analyses. The interest is reportedly particularly strong on the part of funds of hedge funds and European family offices, Asian Investor says.
