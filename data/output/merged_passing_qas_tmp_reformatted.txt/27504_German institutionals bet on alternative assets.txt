German institutionals bet on alternative assets


According to the first survey carried out by the BAI alternative investment association (BAI Investor Survey), 60% of German institutional investors say they are planning to significantly increase their alternative investments in the next 12 months. This propensity is due both to considerations of diversification and higher-than-average performance, says Frank Dornseifer, CEO of BAI.Nearly 50% of respondents report that they have been investing in alternative assets for more than 10 years, and that the experience has been positive. Additionally, alternative investments, particularly private equity, hedge funds and infrastructure, profit from the fact that other asset classes have considerably lost attractiveness in a context of low interest rates.
