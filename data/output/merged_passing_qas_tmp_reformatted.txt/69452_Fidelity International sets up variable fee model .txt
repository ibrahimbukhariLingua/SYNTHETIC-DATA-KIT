Fidelity International sets up variable fee model for five funds


Fidelity International has announced that its variable fee model is now available for five equity funds of its Luxembourg SICAV. Since yesterday, investors are able to invest in a “clean share class” with no commissions, applying the management fee-free model of its Fidelity Funds America Fund, Fidelity Funds Emerging Markets Focus Fund, Fidelity Funds European Growth Fund, Fidelity Funds European Larger Companies Fund and Fidelity Funds World Fund.The new share classes will make it possible to invest with reduced annual management fees of 0.10%, for a total of 0.70%. The variable part of the fees will then symmetrically adjust up or down depending on the performance of the fund compared to its benchmark index. This value will be determined on a three-year annualised basis, exempt of all fees and charges. This scale will go up to a maximum of +0.2% over the annual management fees, and a minimum of -0.2% below, which will mean that the maximal and minimal fees charged would be 0.90% and 0.50%, respectively.“We have listened and responded to the growing debate about the value of active fund management. Our model of variable management fees clearly aligns our interests with those of our clients, and, contrary to the practice common in the market, our fees will be affected in case of under-performance. This is a major step to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to offer the best possible value to our clients. We are convinced that this is an important step in the future of active management, and we hope that it will incite client to remain invested for the long term,” says Paras Anand, director of equity investments for Europe, in a statement.Clients investing via dedicated portfolios, particularly institutional investors, will have access to an appropriate version of the cost model they desire. The value of investments and income resulting can rise or fall, and clients may not recover all of the amount initially invested, the statement warns.
