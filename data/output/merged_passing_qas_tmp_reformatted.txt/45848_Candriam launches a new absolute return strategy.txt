Candriam launches a new absolute return strategy


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Candriam Investors Group, a European affiliate of New York Life Investment Management with EUR89bn in assets, on Tuesday, 5 May unveiled a new “Systematic Long Short Equity” absolute return strategy. The strategy was officially launched in December 2014, the asset management firm says. To create “a growth engine adapted to all market conditions,” five different quantitative models have been deployed as part of this strategy. The strategy allocates a risk budget to each model, to obtain the best possible diversification, and to earn absolute returns which are faithfully correlated to the equity markets treated. Candriam states that its new strategy aims to generate returns of about 8% to 12%, over a management horizon of 3 years, in a controlled risk envelope with a target volatility of 10%.
