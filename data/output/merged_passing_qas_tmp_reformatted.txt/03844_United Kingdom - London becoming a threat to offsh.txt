United Kingdom - London becoming a threat to offshore financial centres


The dominance of offshore asset management centres such as Luxembourg and Dublin may face a threat from the United Kingdom, following the passage of a series of tax relief measures, Financial Times Fund Management reports. The British government has introduced a system by which tax is paid only by investors, and not by funds. It has also created a list of financial instruments in which funds may invest without having their activities classed asâ€¯?trading,? which would make them subject to capital gains tax.
