French regulator presents ways to develop cross-border product ranges in Europe


Although the large number of European asset management passports in action is a witness to the success of the framework, a study released by the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) (“ Distribution transfrontière des fonds en Europe : identifier les barrières à l’entrée et améliorer la confiance des investisseurs”) emphasises that there are still some obstacles to distribution of investment funds in Europe, and proposes means to develop cross-border producr ranges in Europe and build investor trust. In the study, the AMF gives an overview of the passports that have been issued. In number, about 80% of OPCVM funds and 40% of European FIA vehicles have a cross-border passport as of 2016, according to the European Commission. This is a sign of the success of the license, which allows European funds to be sold in other countries as soon as their own national regulator approves them. The annual costs associated with obtaining the passport appear very low considering the activity of the funds: it represents from 0% to 0.0016% of the average volume of assets under management.Although the number of passports issued is high, this is not always synonymous with real sales of funds in the countries targeted by asset management firms. The study identifies some factors working against this cross-border distribution: a preference on the part of distribution networks for their own products, a need to adapt the profile to local consumers, taxation, and a national bias on the part of the consumer.On the basis of these findings, the AMF offers three ways to develop cross-border investment fund product ranges while protecting European consumers: promote open architecture distribution and convergence of sales regulations; strengthen the confidence of savings investors by allowing the local regulator to oversee advertising of financial products sold in its territory; and lastly, open a debate concerning controlling of marketing activities which are conducted from other countries.
