EFAMA calls for revision of Volcker rule


The proposed Volcker rule, in its current form, represents an inadapted extra-territorial application of US legislation, the European financial and asset management association (EFAMA) claims in response to a consultation launched by the US authorities for this newly-proposed legislation.The legislation proposed would significantly exacerbate the negative impact of the Volcker rules on the asset management sector in Europe, without tangibly advancing the objectives of the legislation, EFAMA explains in a statement published on 13 February.The primary concern of EFAMA is related to the highly varied treatment of US mutual funds, on the one hand, and UCITS and other regulated investment funds available to European investors, on the other.“Our members are particularly concerned by the extra-territorial impact of the Volcker legislation on the structure of the asset management sector in Europe. If these problems are not resolved, the rules may lead to a costly and large-scale restructuring of the sector, which has nothing to do with the objectives of the Volcker Rule. It is simply not permissible that the Volcker rule should have a more marked impact in Europe than in the United States,” the director general of EFAMA, Peter de Proft, states.
