Ongoing disagreements and delays will limit the impact of Solvency 2


The Solvency 2 directive still represents “a positive force for change in the insurance sector,” analysts at Morgan Stanley claim in a study published on 23 March (“Solvency 2: The Long and Winding Road,” by Morgan Stanley/Oliver Wyman).However, the lack of political consensus or agreement within the profession mean that the bill is in danger of losing its relevance, and arriving in a final form far from the original vision of its designers. Morgan Stanley does not expect the directive to be applied before 1 January 2014, or even 2015, and in light of concerns on the part of politicians and professionals, the regulator will need to allow for long transitional periods. With this in mind, there are reasons to be concerned that there will be significant divergences between countries in the application of the rules, while heavyweights in the sector will have lost the advantages originally planned.This is thus more an evolution than a revolution, and the initial hopes that Solvency 2 would become an international point of reference for regulation of the insurance sector appears more distant than ever.
