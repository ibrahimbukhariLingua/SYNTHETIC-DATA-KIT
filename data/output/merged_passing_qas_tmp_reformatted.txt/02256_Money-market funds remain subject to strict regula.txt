Money-market funds remain subject to strict regulations


Despite the fact that the Treasury Department’s guarantee program expired Friday, money-market funds must continue to report holdings and valuation information to the SEC in certain circumstances, under an interim rule adopted Friday. If a fund’s net asset value per share falls below USD0.9975, it must notify the regulator and provide a portfolio schedule.
