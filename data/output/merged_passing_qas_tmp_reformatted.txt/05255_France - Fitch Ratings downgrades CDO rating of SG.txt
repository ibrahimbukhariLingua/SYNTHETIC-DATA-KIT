France - Fitch Ratings downgrades CDO rating of SGAM AI


Fitch Ratings has lowered its CDO Asset Manager rating for Société Générale Asset Management Alternative Investments (SGAM AI) from CAM2+ to CAM2.The downgrade largely reflects the negative impact which the credit crisis has had on SGAM AI’s activities, and changes in its management personnel, the ratings agency states. It also takes into account possible instabilities which may result from the repositioning and restructuring of SGAM AI when it merges with Lyxor, Fitch Ratings adds.
