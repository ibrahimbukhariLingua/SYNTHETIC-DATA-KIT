Fortune SG denies pressuring its employees


Z-Ben Advisors reports that Fortune SG (a joint venture of the Société Générale and Bao Steel groups) is denying reports in the local media that the Chinese asset management firm is requiring all of its employees to join an automatic investment plan in which they subscribe to shares in the money market fund Fortune SG Cash Box Money Market Fund, in an effort to boost assets under management.According to Fortune SG, all investments made by personnel in the fund were made voluntarily. However, the Fortune SG product has seen massive subscriptions in the fourth quarter of the past five years running, and then significant redemptions in the following quarter. It is not unusual for Chinese fund management firms to seek to increase their assets in fourth quarter to improve their end-of-year rankings.
