Standard Life Investments evaluates real estate markets for risk


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; }a:link { } Standard Life Investments has designed a new tool to help institutional investors manage risk and inform their decisions when investing in global real estate. The Global Real Estate Implementation Risk tool (GREIR) can help investors find the right markets for their level of risk appetite and understand the expected returns in their global real estate portfolios. It provides an easy method for investors to assess and compare the individual risk ratings of 60 different countries. GREIR produces a risk score for each country that can be converted into a risk adjustment factor, to achieve a more accurate comparison of the ‘at risk’ portion of expected returns from a global real estate portfolio. The GREIR tool aggregates three categories of global surveys, representing more than 300 data points, to evaluate and assess economic, political and real estate specific risks. Indices from all three categories are weighted to produce a risk score of between 1 and 10 for each of the 60 countries included in the rankings. The country with the lowest score is the least risky for real estate investment. The seven components of the score are market size, ease of doing business, competitiveness, innovation, public sector corruption, credit default swap spreads, and transparency. The rankings will be updated on a quarterly basis.
