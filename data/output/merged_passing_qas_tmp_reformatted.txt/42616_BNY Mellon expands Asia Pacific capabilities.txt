BNY Mellon expands Asia Pacific capabilities


BNY Mellon has been appointed by Clearstream and Euroclear (International Central Securities Depositaries or «ICSDs») to provide sub-depositary services in Asia Pacific («APAC») allowing APAC issued global notes to be deposited locally in Hong Kong with BNY Mellon. This extension of BNY Mellon’s established sub-depositary capability into the APAC region offers Asian issuers greater access to global capital markets and enhanced efficiency and flexibility in their settlement processes. Gary Lew, head of Corporate Trust in Asia Pacific for BNY Mellon, said the decision to expand this service is designed to meet the growing demand for bond and note issuances in the APAC region. This new service complements BNY Mellon’s existing Corporate Trust capabilities in the region to position itself at the forefront of initiatives to provide full service closing facilities in region, in collaboration with its ICSD partners.
