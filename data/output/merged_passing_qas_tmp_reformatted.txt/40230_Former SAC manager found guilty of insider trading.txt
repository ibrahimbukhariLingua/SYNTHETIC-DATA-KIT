The case, which lasted three weeks, demonstrated that certain doctors were sharing information on confidential clinical trials with hedge fund traders in exchange for thousands of dollars in fees. The charges were conspiracy and market fraud (two counts). For each one, Martoma can be sentenced 20 years in prison.
