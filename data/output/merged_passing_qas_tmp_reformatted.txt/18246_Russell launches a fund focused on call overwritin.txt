Russell launches a fund focused on call overwriting


Four portfolio managers from Russell Investments, Richard F. Johnson, Jr., Scott A. Maidel, Kal D. Sahlin and Rafael Zayas, have been tasked with the management of the new Russell Strategic Call Overwriting Fund, a product which aims to generate total returns with lower volatility than US equity markets, through sales of call options on an equity portfolio, and seeking revenues from dividends on equities in the portfolio.In detail, Russell will invest primarily in equities with ties to the US market for this fund, through the use of a quantitative multi-factor model to select mainly ordinary shares in companies with a large or mid-sized capitalisation. The management team will meanwhile sell call options on broader market indices. The process is known as call overwriting. The writing of call options aims to reduce the volatility of the fund compared with the US equity markets, and to generate revenues with cash premiums.
