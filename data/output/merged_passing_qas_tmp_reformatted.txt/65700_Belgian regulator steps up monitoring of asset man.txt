Belgian regulator steps up monitoring of asset management and non-bank financial intermediation activities


Belgian financial market authority FSMA together with theNational Bank of Belgium (NBB) have updated a study on asset management and non-bank financial intermediation businesses in Belgium which formed a €147bn market as at the end of 2017 according to the report.Last year, a local financial expert group that drew recommendations on the future of the Belgian financial sector, the High Level Expert Group, recommended improving the monitoring of risks associated to these activities and their interconnections with other sectors. FSMA stated that currently no substantial systemic risks have been identified in relation to asset management and non-bank financial intermediation but that the developments in both areas and the links with other economic sectors do, however, require careful monitoring, including for potential reputational risks to financial service groups."The latter include the so-called ‘step-in’ risk, namely, the risk that these groups may de facto feel obliged to compensate clients for the risks associated, for example, with the investment funds sold by these groups, even where they are not contractually bound to do so. The FSMA and the NBB consider it very important to collect hitherto unavailable data on asset management and non-bank financial intermediation. It is for this reason that the FSMA has adjusted and expanded the statistical information which investment funds are required to submit,» the regulator explained.A royal decree providing investment funds with tools to face any liquidity issue will be published soon.Commenting on the study, the Belgian minister of Finance, Johan Van Overtveldt, said : «The report illustrates the important progress observed in the development of capital markets in Belgium and Europe, which should better shield taxpayers’ money from financial calamities, while at the same time providing more direct funding to the Belgian economy. It also helps to satisfy my concerns over the lack of transparency and supervision of these non-bank funding channels. Regarding the evolution in “shadow banking” we must remain vigilant. There is still a lot of work to be done."NBB’s governor Jan Smets said the risks associated with asset management and non-bank financial intermediation are a priority for the NBB from the perspective of financial stability, adding that international developments also have to be closely monitored.
