Crédit Agricole Assurances signs PRI


Crédit Agricole Assurances on 31 March announced that it has decided to sign the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN-PRI). The firm becomes the first banking-insurance business to sign the PRI, Crédit Agricole says in a statement, making the step a sign of genuine progress in the consideration of extra-financial criteria in analysis and investment decisions. By joining the PRI, Crédit Agricole Assurances joins other entities of the Crédit Agricole which have already signed the PRI (Amundi, Chevreux, Crédit Agricole Private Equity), and confirms the desire of Crédit Agricole to bring its investment decisions into harmony with the needs of society.
