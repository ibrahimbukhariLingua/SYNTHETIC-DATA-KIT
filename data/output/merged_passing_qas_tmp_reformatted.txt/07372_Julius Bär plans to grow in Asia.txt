Julius Bär plans to grow in Asia


The Julius Bär group is planning to enlarge its presence in Asia with the objective of making the region its second-largest market after Switzerland. Julius Bär will develop its activities in Hong Kong by the end of the year, open a representative office in Shanghai, and found a trust in Singapore next year, the firm announced on 6 September in a statement. The group is also planning to extend its business banking activities in the region. The decisions at Julius Bär originate from a management committee which for the first time met in Singapore to emphasize the importance the firm attaches to the Asian market. “Wealth used to be concentrated in major centres. Now, growth in emerging markets will allow the world to improve its quality of life, and to widen the distribution of wealth, in a process which will also benefit the investment professions,” says chairman Raymond J. Baer. Thomas R. Meier, a member of the executive board and CEO for Asia and the Middle East, reaffirmed that “Singapore and Hong Kong are our major entry-points to Asia, as the former will serve as regional headquarters for South-East Asia, and the latter for North Asia.” The group has more than 400 employees in Asia, out of total personnel of about 3,500.
