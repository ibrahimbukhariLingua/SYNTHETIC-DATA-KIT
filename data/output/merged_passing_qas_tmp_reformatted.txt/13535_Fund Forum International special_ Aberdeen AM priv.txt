Fund Forum International special: Aberdeen AM privileges organic growth


Aberdeen Asset Management, which not long ago was highly active on the mergers and acquisitions markets, is calmer now in that area. That is not expected to change in the next few months, Martin Gilbert, CEO of Aberdeen Asset Management, has told Newsmanagers at the Fund Forum International, being held from Tuesday to Thursday this week in Monaco. “We are doing very well at growing organically,” he explains, adding that he does not feel the need to make new acquisitions. “In addition, the prices are now very high, and banks are not selling anything off anymore.”In the United States, where an acquisition had been planned not long ago, Gilbert estimates that Aberdeen AM needs to build its fund distribution activities. He feels that the products are good, but warns against poor management of some of them, particularly synthetic ETFs, which may do damage to the UCITS brand.Gilbert, who was one of the founders of Aberdeen, which now manages GBP181bn in assets, says that the key to success for management firms is to ensure comfortable operating margins and to be able to retain talent. In order to retain good managers, being independent, as his firm is, is manifestly an advantage, as it means that employees can be offered a stake in the firm’s capital.
