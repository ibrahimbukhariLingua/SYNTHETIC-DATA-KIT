Amiral Gestion doubles assets in one year


Amiral Gestion has doubled its assets in one year, to a total of EUR3.6bn. Last year at the same time, the independent asset management firm founded in 2003 had about EUR1.8bn in assets under management. This growth is large ly due to “significant” inflows of about EUR900m since the beginning of the year, according to Benjamin Biard, chief development officer at Amiral Gestion, interviewed at a press conference.The Sextant fund range represents EUR2.8bn in total assets, with more than EUR1.8bn for the Sextant Grand Large, a diversified flexible fund which shows returns of 2.7% since the beginning of the year, and 12.52% over five years (annualised, as of 31 August). This range has recently grown with the launch of a sixth fund, Sextant Bond Picking, which is also the first bond fund from the firm. The EUR800m which are not managed via collective management are managed under institutional mandates (EUR500m) and private management (EUR300m). Thirty five people now work for Amiral, 20 more than in September 2014, and the recruitments have not ended, with the firm announcing five additional recruitments, two of them sales positions, by the start of 2018. The Spanish office is expected to gain one person. The structure, now located in Barcelona, will be moving to Madrid by the end of the year. It has EUR200m in assets under management. For other international developments, Biard says that the priority is to add to the international management team. Amiral has also opened a research office in Singapore at the start of the year, to “get closer to investments in Asia.” However, the firm is not planning to open branches in all corners of Europe, as its location in Spain was rather the fruit of favourable circumstances than a decision associated with an expansion strategy. “We have no ambitions in terms of assets under management,” says Biard. “Our only objective is the performance of our funds.”
