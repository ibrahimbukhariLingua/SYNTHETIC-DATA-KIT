UK pension funds waste billions on active management


UK pension funds “waste” more than GBP6bn per year by investing in actively-managed equity, bond and real estate funds, rather than passive funds which cost less and post better returns, according to a study by Evercore Pan Asset, cited by Financial Times fund management. The study of the 14 most popular asset classes with UK pension funds finds that the median passive fund outperforms the median active fund in 13 cases over the past five years. The average difference between the passive and active funds was 6.5 over five years, which is greater than the difference in price alone, which was an average of 60 basis points per year for active funds and 20 points per year for passive funds.
