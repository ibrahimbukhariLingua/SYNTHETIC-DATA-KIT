German asset management association opens an office in Brussels


The German asset management association BVI on 30 June announced the opening of an office in Brussels, which begins operating on 1 July.“This presence in the political centre of the European Union gives us a way to more effectively employ the expertise of German asset management in the European legislative process,” the new director of the association, Thomas Richter, says in a statement.A series of new European regulations (AIMF, UCITS directive, MiFID directive) necessitate an increased level of attention on the part of professionals. “Ordinances and directives are formulated in Brussels, but the details of putting these directives into practice will now also be dictated more from Brussels in the future,” Richter says.With this in mind, the association considers it indispensable to instigate and maintain dialogue with political leaders, and to intensify cooperation with the European asset management association (EFAMA). “With locations in Frankfurt, Berlin and Brussels, we are now well-placed to maintain dialogue with politicians in the places where policy is decided,” Richter says.The Brussels office will be led by Ulrike Kohl, who is already familiar with the workings of Brussels, having worked with several members of European Parliament at the European federation of savings associations.
