Investors steer clear of new Ross fund


According to sources familiar with the matter, the asset objectives for the WLR Recovery Fund V from WL Ross & Co have been lowered to USD2bn-USD2.5bn, down from a previously announced USD4bn, the Wall Street Journal reports.As of the end of August, subscriptions totalled only slightly more than one tenth of the initial objective, in a sign that private equity firms are having a lot of trouble bringing in money when the markets show chequered performance.Some investors have also held back out of uncertainty following the succession of Wilbur Ross Junior, 73, as head of the business, which is owned by Invesco.
