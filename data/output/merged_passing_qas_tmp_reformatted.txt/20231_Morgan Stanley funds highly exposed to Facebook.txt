Morgan Stanley funds highly exposed to Facebook


The Wall Street Journal reports that several mutual funds from Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter for the initial public offering of Facebook, which brought in USD200m, are highly exposed to shares in the firm. Morningstar reports that eight out of nine mutual funds with the largest investments in shares in the social networking fir are Morgan Stanley funds. It would not appear that rules set by the SEC to limit investments made during a firmâ€™s IPO have been violated.As of 31 July, 5.7% of the Morgan Stanley Force Growth Portfolio (USD1.6bn in total) were placed in Facebook shares. The proportion was 5.5% for the Morgan Stanley Institutional Opportunity Portfolio, and 4.8% for the Morgan Stanley Institutional Growth Portfolio. For other affected Morgan Stanley funds, the percentage ranges from 3.6% to 4.6%.However, Morgan Stanley is not the institutional investor with the largest exposure to Facebook, an area in which the leaders are Fidelity Investment, T. Rowe Price and Goldman Sachs Asset Management.
