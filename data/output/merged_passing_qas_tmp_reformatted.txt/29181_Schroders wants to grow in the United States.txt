Schroders wants to grow in the United States


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } UK-based Schroders wants to grow and is not hiding it. “We have GBP580m in cash,” its executive vice president, Massimo Tosato, tells Les Echos. This money “could be used both for acquisitions of local companies for international development and fo investments in organic growth,” he continues.Growth is proving more timid in Europe, its favourite market, and Schroders is turning to Asia and the United States.In the latter country, which can be hyper-competitive and closed off to foreigners, it is expecting to double in size in the next five years. As of 31 March 2013, assets under management in the United States already totalled GBP42bn, of which GBP7bn were at STW, a bond asset management firm acquired in December.
