Switzerland - Private banking: directors fear the worst


Lâ€™Agefi Switzerland reports that heads of private banks fear the sector may be entering the worst crisis wealth management has seen since the 1930s. They predict that there will be a major wave of consolidation, according to a study undertaken by the strategy consulting firm Booz & Company of 20 leading decision-makers in Swiss wealth management. Thus far, the effects of the crisis have had only a limited impact on the annual reports from private banks. Several firms have even posted major inflows of capital. But the real problems are yet to come. A heavy decline in assets under management and eroding margins have already impacted results. In the 2008 fiscal year, private banks saw a decilne of as much as 20% to their revenues. According to estimates by Booz, if the financial markets do not recover significantly in 2009, heavier losses are to be expected, of about 30%.
