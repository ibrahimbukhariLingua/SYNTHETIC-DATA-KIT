Threadneedle founder may take over as head of Prudential


Paul Manduca, founder of Threadneedle, may be nominated to take over as head of the Prudential financial group, which in addition to insurance, also has asset management activities at M&G, the Telegraph reports. Manduca would succeed Harvey McGrath. Recently, Manduca’s name is said to have been submitted to the British Financial Services Authority (FSA), who would then be required to ensure that the nominee has the “appropriate capabilities” to direct one of the largest British financial groups. Prudential may announce the appointment in the next few days. Manduca would then leave his position as chairman at Aon in order to take over as head of Prudential over the summer.
