IASB and FASB publish a survey and report


The IASB, which establishes international accounting standards, and the FASB, the US accounting standards body, on 11 March announced the publication of a survey and report on the reporting equity concept. The proposals in the document are part of a joint project on the part of the two authorities to set up a conceptual framework to provide a solid basis to develop future accounting standards. The consultation will remain open until 16 July this year.
