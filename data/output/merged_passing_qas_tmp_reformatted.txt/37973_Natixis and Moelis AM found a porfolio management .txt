Natixis and Moelis AM found a porfolio management joint venture


Natixis and Moelis Asset Management have announced the creation of Chamonix Partners Capital Management LLC, a joint venture dedicated to portfolio management. Chamonix will initially manage Valle Blanche Fund Alpha, LP, a fund with USD1.3bn in assets, which will acquire structured products for its portfolio in euros and US dollars from Natixis GAPC (Gestion Active des Portefeuilles Cantonnés). The invesors will be 100% external to Moelis and Natixis. “This sale, which includes the entirety of the portfolio and associated risks, represents a significant step for Natixis in the closure of GAPC,” a statement says. In addition to this first fund, Chamonix will also raise and manage other funds of the same type, which will then be put to acquisition. The board of directors at Chamonix will be composed of three representatives appointed by Natixis and three representatives appointed by Moelis. Chamonix will manage Vallee Blance Fund Alpha, LP via an investment board. Its members have profound and complementary experience in this asset class. Martin St. Pierre, chairman of the investment board, had previously been president and CEO, after serving as global head of credit trading at Natixis.
