Acropole Mix Income changes name


The Acropole Mix Income fund, founded in 2010 and managed by Acropole Asset Management, is changing its name, to become Acropole Global High Yield, undoubtedly to increase its visibility in the high yield category, which is highly popular with investors currently. Its investment strategy, however, remains rigorously the same. It is a fund which invests in high yield international bonds (Europe, the United States, Asia). The investment universe is composed both of corporate and convertible high yield bonds. The management team, led by Julien Chauveau, currently has a preference for the top end of high yield, with an average rating of about BB+ and a short average maturity. The portfolio is diversified in the number of issuers (about 150 holdings) and geographical origin. Currency risks are hedged. For management of the fund, Acropole AM relies on credit research from Cheyne Capital, its shareholder.
