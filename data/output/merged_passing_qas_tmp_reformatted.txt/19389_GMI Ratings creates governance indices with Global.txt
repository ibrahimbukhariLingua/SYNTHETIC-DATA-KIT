GMI Ratings creates governance indices with Global Index Group


The environmental and accounting/governance ratings agency GMI Ratings has announced that it has signed a license agreement with Global Index Group to develop corporate governance indices using non-traditional risk measures developed by GMI ratings, known as Accounting & Governance Risk (AGR) and Key Metrics, an environmental, social and governance (ESG) list. AGR ratings reflect the accounting and governance practices statistically associated with disciplinary enforcement by the SEC, lawsuits and other events which may provoke rapid falls in the value of shares. Concretely, the cooperation between GMI Ratings and Global Invest Group will result in the creation of the GIG/GMI High Governance Index (GIGHGI), which will be available to clients who subscribe for a license of over 60 days. The agency also states that it is already in talks with an asset management firm which is planning to license the GIGHGI index for use as the underlying for a tracker product. The development of the index is led by Kelly Laughton, CEO of Glboal Index Group, who was the founder of the range of Russell indices. GMI Ratings was created in 2010 by a merger of GovernanceMetrics International, The Corporate Library and Audit Integrity.
