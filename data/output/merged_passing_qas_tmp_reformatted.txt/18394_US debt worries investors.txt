US debt worries investors


Despite assurances from Barack Obama, who was re-elected on 6 November as president of the United States, that “the best is yet to come,” investors remained attentive to problems still in suspense: US debt and difficulties in a euro zone emerging from the crisis. In this environment, money market funds posted inflows of over USD50bn in the week to 7 November, while bond funds posted net inflows of nearly USD10bn, according to estimates by EPFR Global. Since the beginning of the year, bond funds have attracted over USD400bn. Equity funds finished the week with inflows of USD1.12bn, while dividend funds attracted over USD900m, despite risks related to the development of tax legislation in the United States following the Obama victory. Funds dedicated to the financial sector posted inflows of nearly USD1bn in the week under review.
