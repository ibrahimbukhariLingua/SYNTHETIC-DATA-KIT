Schroders brings GAIA platform to Spain


The CNMV has granted approval for the new Luxembourg UCITS III-compliant hedge fund platform from Schroders, entitled Global Alternative Investor Access (GAIA) which already received authorisation in Germany and Austria, more than a month ago (see Newsmanagers of 11 January), to be made available in Spain. As in the other two countries, Schroders has registered the Schroder GAIA Egerton European Equity A fund with the Spanish regulator. Due diligence for funds included in the portfolio will be undertaken by NewFinance Capital (NFC), an affiliate of Schroders specialised in funds of hedge funds. GAIA will be primarily aimed at private banks and institutional clients.
