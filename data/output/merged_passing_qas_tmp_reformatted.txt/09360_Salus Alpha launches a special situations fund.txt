Salus Alpha launches a special situations fund


Salus Alpha will on 15 March launch a special situations fund with the Austrian fund manager Roland Neuwirth, which will invest 30-40% of its assets in businesses of the German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) which are likely to generate returns in the long term, while the remainder of assets (0-70%) will be placed in short to mid-term opportunistic investments in firms which are the subject of takeover bids, which are undergoing a change in management, which are being added or removed from an index, or which are buying back shares. Neuwirth will also be allowed to select firms on the basis of directorsâ€™ dealings, IPOs, capital increase operations, or surprises in profit levels. The fund, which complies with the UCITS III directive, will be managed with an absolute return approach, and will aim for annual returns of 10-15% with volatility of under 10%.
