S&amp;P Indices offers new high yield indices


The index provider S&P Indices on 27 February announced the launch of two new indices, the S&P UK High Yield Dividend Aristocrats and the S&P Euro High Yield Dividend Aristocrats, which measure the performance of companies of the S&P Europe Broad Market high yield index in the United Kingdom and the euro zone. A statement says that businesses must have paid rising or stable dividends over a period of at least 10 years in order to be included in the indices. S&P has previously launched an index of this type based on the S&P 1500. State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) will offer SPDR ETFs based on these indices.
