JPMorgan plans to grow in private banking


In an interview with the Börsen-Zeitung, Håkan Strängh, Head of Private Bank Germany and Austria, has announced that JPMorgan is expecting a net increase in its private banking assets of 15% per year, through organic growth in the segment of clients with over EUR10m in financial savings, and acquisitions. Eventually, the manager is hoping to enter the “under EUR10m” segment, which would require setting up a network covering all of Germany.
