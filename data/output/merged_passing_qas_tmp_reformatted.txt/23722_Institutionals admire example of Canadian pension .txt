Institutionals admire example of Canadian pension funds


Canadian public pension funds appear as precursors in the eyes of institutional investors, who are seeking to imitate them, The Economist reports. It’s not the size of the funds which interests investors – they manage over USD640bn in assets – so much as their investment strategy. Unlike many pension funds, Canadian institutions manage their portfolios internally and invest directly. They invest more than other funds in buyout operations, infrastructure and real estate. The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) would like to have 90% of its assets managed internally by the end of 2012. Canadian pension funds often make small solo transactions, but they undertake larger operations as co-sponsors with major private equity firms. This strategy allows thm to make substantial savings, particularly in private equity, where the famous standard commission level is 2/20 (2% of assets and 20% of profits). This approach has manifestly paid off. In the past ten years, the Ontario teachers’ pension fund, a pioneer in this area, has earned the best returns of the 330 largest public and private pension funds in the world.
