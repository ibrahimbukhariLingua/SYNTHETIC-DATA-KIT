JP Morgan expects a trading loss of USD7.5bn at most


Les Echos reports that JP Morgan is expecting a trading loss of USD7.5bn at most. At a presentation of results for second quarter, Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JP Morgan, revealed that losses due to bets on credit derivatives by the London-based teams of the Chief Investment Office (CIO) totalled USD4.4bn in second quarter. Overall, trading losses to date total USD5.8bn. According to Les Echos, the bank has “discovered information that casts doubt on the integrity of traders’ ‘marks,’ and which suggests that some individuals may have attempted to falsify the total amount of losses incurred by the portfolio in first quarter.”
