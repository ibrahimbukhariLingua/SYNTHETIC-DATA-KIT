Commodities ETFs face regulatory constraints


Lâ€™Agefi reports that the CFTC is investigating the influence of speculative investment on price volatility on the US energy market. Following this investigation, the sectoral regulator is planning to set limits on positions permitted on certain assets on futures markets. ETFs, publicly-traded index-based funds which trade in commodities, may be the first victims of these increased regulations, with the objective of protecting the final consumer of energy and ensuring that prices paid by the consumer are fair and not the result of price manipulation.
