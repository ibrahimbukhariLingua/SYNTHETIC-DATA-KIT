Better Capital raises GBP142m


The star private equity manager Jon Moultaon has raised GBP142m for his new fund, Better Capital, which will launch an initial public offering at 100 pence per share on the AIM this Thursday, the Financial Times reports. Better Capital, based in Guernsey, but with offices in Covent Garden in London, received funds from Ruffer Investment Management, BlackRock, Scottish Widows, Aviva and Artemis. The fund will be a feeder for a traditional private equity fund managed by Moulton. He will invest in British firms with “significant operating issues [that] may have associated financial distress,” and will invest no more than GBP28m in any single operation, nor more than 10% of its assets in listed companies.
