United States - Merrill Lynch sues Deutsche Bank


Merrill Lynch has field a civil suit against Deutsche Bank in New York, for poaching its treasurer, Eric Heaton. Handelsblatt relays reports in Bloomberg that Heaton resigned from Merrill Lynch in February, and immediately joined Deutsche Bank, without respecting a non-competition clause which would have required him to observe a gardening leave of one year. On top of that, eleven experienced managers are said to have been recruited by Deutsche Bank over the course of several months; they left the same day as Heaton. Deutsche Bank admits that it recruited only six senior managers from Merrill Lynch, including Eric Heaton and his brother David, the former head of asset management.
