French regulator renews its warnings against diamond investment offers


The French financial market authority, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), on 3 April repeated its warnings to the public against offers of investments in diamonds. “Apparently very attractive, these offers sparkle with promises of exceptional, unrealistic gains. The AMF calls on retail investors to exercise the greatest vigilance,” a statement says. Despite its previous warnings, the AMF is observing an increase in the communication campaigns deployed by diamond investment platforms toward the public.The AMF also contnues to be highly popular with savings investors complaining of aggressive sales tactics on the part of these platforms, difficulty recoverying their investments and in reaching their interlocutors. “Due to the uncertainty surrounding these offerings and the often unbalanced character of their communications, the AMF recommends that investors not respond to offers from these entities, and not to relay them to third parties, in any form,” the AMF adds.
