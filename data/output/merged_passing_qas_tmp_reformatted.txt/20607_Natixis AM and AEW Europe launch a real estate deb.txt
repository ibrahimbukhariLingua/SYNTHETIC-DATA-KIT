Natixis AM and AEW Europe launch a real estate debt fund


Natixis Asset Management and AEW Europe, a European specialist in real estate investment advising and asset management for third parties, yesterday announced that it has raised EUR240m for its new fund of senior real estate debt, Senior European Loan Fund. The product is the first closed sub-fund of senior real estate debt with a 7-year maturity. Since its launch, the fund, aimed at professional investors and qualified companies, will be making its first closing with EUR240m, and a target size of about EUR500m eventually. The sub-fund aims to earn returns similar to those on investment grade bonds (whose rating ranges from AAA to BBB-), a statement says. The sub-fund, managed by Senior European Loan Management, an affiliate of AEW Europe advised by a team at Natixis Asset Management, invests in senior real estate debt, financing office, commercial and logistical real estate properties in Europe, primarily in France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Its management strategy is to both put new financing in place with banks, and to buy up existing debt.
