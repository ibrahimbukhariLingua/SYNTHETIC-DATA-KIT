Scott Rothsteinâ€™s miniature Madoff fraud took in over USD1bn


On Thursday, the FBI estimated that the Ponzi type pyramid fraud scheme operated by lawyer Scott W. Rothstein probably ran to over USD1bn, the Wall Street Journal reports. On Monday, the US government filed a civil case against the high-profile Florida lawyer, accusing him of selling investors participations in fictitious legal settlements, promising double-digit returns. The fraud began in 2005, and only came to light in October, when investors complained of not having been paid. The FBI says the investigation will take time, and criminal charges are not expected to be filed for several more weeks.
