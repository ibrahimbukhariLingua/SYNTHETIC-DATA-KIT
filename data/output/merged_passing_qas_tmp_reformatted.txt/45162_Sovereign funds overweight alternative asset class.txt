Sovereign funds overweight alternative asset classes

One of the trends of the moment is strong demand for alternative asset classes, according to the third annual Invesco study of sovereign investors, the “Invesco Global Sovereign Asset Management Study,” which covers the investment behaviour of 60 sovereign funds worldwide, representing USD7.090trn in assets. The private equity home market elicits 69% positive responses this year, compared with 64% last year. Global real estate gets 63% favourable opinions, as does global infrastructure (63%). Global private equity is overweighted by 48% of sovereign funds. Global equities have lost weight as part of allocations year over year, and has declined from 22% to 21% overweight in portfolios. Bonds, for their part, are underweighted by sovereign funds (-47% for local bonds and -10% for global bonds). The study finds that sovereign funds are paying particular attention to emerging market infrastructure. The complete study may be consulted at www.igsams.invesco.com.
