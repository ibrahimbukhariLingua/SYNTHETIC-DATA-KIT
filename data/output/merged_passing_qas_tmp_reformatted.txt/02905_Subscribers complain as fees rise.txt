Subscribers complain as fees rise


As of 1 August, Allianz Global Investors will be introducing a performance fee for 19 of its funds, while it will be cancelling fees of this type for 16 others. At DWS, only one third of the product range charges fees of this type, while at Deka, there are plans to introduce performance commissions for all equity fund products next year. Union Investments has been charging commissions of this type for 15 of its funds since December, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports.Overall, the asset management sector has already lost 50% or more of its clientsâ€™ money, and now that in the mid-term gains are to be expected, these asset management firms are seeking to introduce percentage charges on gains. This is all proceeding as though banks and management firms had gone mad, one investor writes. This attitude is difficult to understand, since actors are finding themselves contronted not only by the consequences of the crisis, but also by the emergence of considerably more inexpensive competitors, in the form of ETFs. But it is true that they will also need to contend with rising costs.
