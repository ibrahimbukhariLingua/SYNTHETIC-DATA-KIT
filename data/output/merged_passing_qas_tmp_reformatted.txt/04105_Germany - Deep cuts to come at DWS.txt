Germany - Deep cuts to come at DWS


The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung has learned that, to consolidate power in the hands of the management team at the bank, Kevin Parker, head of asset management at Deutsche Bank, is planning to impose a massive cost savings initiative. Restructuring will now also affect Europe, where the head of asset management was previously Stephan Kunze, who has recently resigned. Fund management in Europe may be concentrated in Frankfurt. The production of funds in Italy has already been abandoned, and the same may now occur in other European countries, such as Spain.
