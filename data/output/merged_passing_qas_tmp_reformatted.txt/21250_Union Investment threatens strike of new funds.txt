Union Investment threatens strike of new funds


The German asset management firm Union Investment (co-operative banks) claims that the proposed financial transaction tax could be in violation of the principle of equal treatment for small savings investors. If the law were to be passed, Union would cease to launch new open-ended funds in Germany. “If the financial centres of London, Luxembourg and Ireland backed out and did not apply the tax, that would mean that the ones who caused the crisis were not participating in financing the cost of the crisis,” says Hans Joachim Reinke, chairman of the board at Union Investment, referring to a proposal by the German government to introduce the tax in only nine EU countries. Although asset management firms are able to move, small German savings investors would be trapped into paying the tax. Union, which has EUR37bn in assets under management in open-ended funds, has calculated that the transaction tax would cut about 0.4% per year off the returns on its products, which would mean for subscribers, German savings investors, a cost of about EUR1.5bn over ten years, without taking into account the actual performance of the funds. The asset management firm claims that in these conditions, under its fiduciary obligation, it is required to protect its clients as well as possible against the unfair implications of the transaction tax. One solution would be not to launch open-ended funds in Germany.
