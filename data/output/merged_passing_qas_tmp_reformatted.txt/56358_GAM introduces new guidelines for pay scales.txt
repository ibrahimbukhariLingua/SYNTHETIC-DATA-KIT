GAM introduces new guidelines for pay scales


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } GAM Holding on 20 December announced that it has instituted new guidelines for pay scales, to apply to the entire group. These guidelines are the result of a survey of shareholders, following a more general examination by the remunerations committee of the board of directors, chared by Nancy Mistretta and overseen by Hugh Scott-Barrett. Four major principles will determine policy in terms of remuneration: remuneration is subordinate to performance; initiatives are in line with the long-term interests of shareholders, transparency plays a determining role, and appropriate risk management must also be taken into account, the firm explains.
