AFG to publish a guide to best practices for money market funds


The French financial management association (AFG) will soon publish a guide to best practices to strengthen the image of French money market funds, according to Arnaud Faller, chief investment officer at CPR Asset Management and chairman of the technical committee of the AFG, in an interview in Gestion Info (November 2012, No. 6).When asked about the fact that difference regulators are discussing shadow banking, also known as parallel finance, in relation to money market funds, Faller has an unambiguous response. “There is a debate, but we think that variable net asset value money market funds are not concerned. They help to refinance the entire economy, are well-regulated by rules pubished by ESMA, for the quality of the signature, the maturity of underlying assets, and disclosure obligations,” Faller says.
