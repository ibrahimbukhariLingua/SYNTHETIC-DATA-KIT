S&amp;P places F&amp;C AM ratings on negative watch


On Thursday, Standard & Poorâ€™s placed the long-term counterparty rating of BBB-, and short-term rating of A-3 for F&C Asset Management under watch with negative implications. The move also applies to its BB rating for subordinate debt. The measure is a result of a deterioration in debt servicing parameters, with EBITDA likely to fall below three and a half times the volume of debt.
