Carmignac played it safe in second quarter


At a presentation of his analysis of the economic situation, Frédéric Leroux global manager and director of risk management at Carmignac Patrimoine, said the firm has responded to the crisis by adopting a prudent attitude, in particular by reducing exposure to equities in second quarter, and making use of futures on European and US indices and short positions on sectoral indices of the European banking sector. In bonds, the French asset management firm has steered clear of “second-class” government debt, in preference to German bunds and US Treasuries.
