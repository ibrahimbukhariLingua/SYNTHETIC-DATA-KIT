F&amp;C removes Cairn from its ethical fund portfolios


F&C Asset Management itself relays reports in the Herald Scotland that Cairn Energy has been removed from the portfolio of ethical funds from F&C (Stewardship range, GBP2.6bn in assets), due to its controversial drilling activities in the Arctic ocean off Greenland, which are an environmental as well as a security risk.Karina Livack, director of governance and sustainable investment at F&C, says that Cain Energy has not been removed from all portfolios, but that the decision has been taken from a general point of view to exclude all businesses which run Arctic drilling operations.
