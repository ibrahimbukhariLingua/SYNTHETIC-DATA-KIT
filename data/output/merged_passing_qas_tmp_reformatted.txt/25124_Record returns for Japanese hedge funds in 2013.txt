Record returns for Japanese hedge funds in 2013


Japanese hedge funds are expected to finish the year with record returns, according to Bloomberg. Managers are betting that reforms engaged by Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe will combine to set Japan on the path of growth. The Stratton Street Capital LLP warrant fund posted returns of over 300% in 2013, while the Hayate Japan Equity Long-Short Fund nearly doubled its gains last year. The Eurekahedge Japan Hedge Fund, which tracks the performance of 80 funds, posted gains of 24% between January and November, which is expected to be the best annual result since the beginning of statistics in 2000, Bloomberg notes. In 2012, the index was at the bottom of the table, with returns of 6%. Funds specialised in Japan saw their assets rise by USD451m in second half 2013.
