State Street GA launches first SSG ETF of international convertible bonds


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) this Wednesday, 15 October, announced the launch of the first publicly-traded ETF of international convertible bonds on the Xetra platform from the stock market operator Deutsche Börse. The vehicle, entitled SPDR Thomson Reuters Global Convertible Bond Ucits ETF, aims to offer investors “transparent exposure at optimised cost, with the risk/return profile unique to this asset class,” the asset management firm says in a statement. Concretely, the new ETF reproduces the Thomson Reuters Qualified Global Convertible Index, which currently includes convertible bonds from issuers worldwide, denominated in several currencies. It also brings investors exposure both to the characteristics of bonds and to those of equities, the asset management firm says. “SSGA has been managing convertible bonds in passive management in ETF format for more than five years in the United States, with more than USD3bn in assets under management, covering the liquid portion of the US convertible bond market,” says Olivier Paquier, head of SPDR ETF, the affiliate of SSGA, for France, Monaco, Spain and Portugal, cited in a statement. With the launch of this new product, there are now 59 SPDR ETFs available in Europe.
