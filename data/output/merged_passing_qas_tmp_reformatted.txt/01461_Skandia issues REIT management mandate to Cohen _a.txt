Skandia issues REIT management mandate to Cohen &amp; Steers


Skandia Investment Group (SIG) announced on 17 November that it has issued a management mandate for its USD300m REIT fund to the institutional management firm Cohen & Steers, which is listed on the New York stock exchange, specializes in real estate, and manages over USD22.5bn as of 30 September this year. The fund was previously managed by La Salle Investment Management. The modification will be accompanied by a change in benchmark, as the UBS Global Investors index will be replaced by the FTSE EPRA NAREIT Developed Index. As a result, the weight of the fundâ€™s exposure to the US market will fall to about 40%, compared to 50% previously. Asia, particularly Hong Kong and Japan, will gain weight as a proportion of the fund overall. Following approval from the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the fund, currently known as the Skandia Global Property Securities (LaSalle) Fund, will change names, to become the Skandia Global Property Securities Fund.
