OECD calls for rigorous and transparent stress testing


L’Agefi Switzerland reports that the OECD claims in its annual report on the European Union, published on 21 September, that “in many EU countries, uncertainties remain about the scale of problems with compromised assets remaining on banks’ balance sheets. There are continuing fears that banks lack sufficient capital to confront a possible further degradation in economic conditions.” “Systematic, rigorous and transparent stress testing is necessary to quantify the needs for owners’ equity at the various European banks,” the OECD states.
