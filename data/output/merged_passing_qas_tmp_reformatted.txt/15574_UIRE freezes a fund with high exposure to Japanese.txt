UIRE freezes a fund with high exposure to Japanese real estate


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The German management firm Union Investment Real Estate (UIRE) has announced that until further notice, subscriptions are frozen from 17 March for the open-ended real estate fund UniImmo: Global (DE0009805556), which had EUR2.34bn in assets as of the end of October. The net asset value of the fund had already been lowered by 4.45% recently (see Newsmanagers of 3 March), due to the depreciation of three properties in Tokyo.Now, the suspension is explained as a result of the fact that seven Tokyo properties in the portfolio represent 14% of total assets for the fund. The other real estate funds from UIRE are also invested in Tokyo, but to a lesser extent, and consequently none of them have been frozen for the moment.
