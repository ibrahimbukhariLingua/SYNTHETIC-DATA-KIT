Libor scandal: Barclays CEO is next to resign


The scandal over manipulations of the Libor interest rate by the British Barclays Bank claimed another victim on 3 July, in the person of the CEO of the bank, Bob Diamond, who became the shameful emblem of the crimes of the City. The chairman of the board of directors at Barclays, Marcus Agius, had announced his resignation the day before, in an effort to calm the scandal, which had ignited public opinion and British political decision-makers. “External pressure on Barclays has reached a level which risked damaging the venture, and I couldn’t let that happen,” the American director said in a statement to explain his shock immediate resignation. “I am very disappointed because the events of last week give an image of Barclays and its employees which couldn’t be further from the truth,” Diamond adds.
