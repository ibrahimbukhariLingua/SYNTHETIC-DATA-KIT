Sentences against two KBL Richelieu fund managers lifted


The French council of state has overturned a verdict by the local financial regulator’s sanctions committee in January 2010 to impose sanctions against Nathalie Pelras and Julien Quistrebert. In addition to a reprimand, the two fund managers at KBL Richelieu were fined EUR30,000 over the case, in relation to facts in August 2007, when the Netherlands firm Completel Europe NV, a national telecommunications operator largely serving business clients, was the object of a takeover bid by the Altice B2b company. According to the French regulator investigation report, Quistrebert, a fund manager at Richelieu Finance Gestion Privée, is thought to have received information a few days in advance of the operation from a banker in the Corporate Finance department of HSBC, which includes the price to be offered for the shares the next day. Quistrebert is then thought to have made large-scale purchases of the shares for the Richelieu Evolution fund, and also informed Pelras, who did the same for the Richelieu Europe fund. In light of the fact that “the sanctions commission incorrectly found that the two persons were privy to privileged information,” the council of state has cancelled the disciplinary and pecuniary sanctions against the two portfolio managers.
