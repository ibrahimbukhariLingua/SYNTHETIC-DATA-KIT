Credit Suisse: former head of private banking in United States blows whistle


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } A whistleblower in the United States has informed the US authorities of doubtful practices at Credit Suisse, the newspaper Tagesanzeiger reports in its 7 march issue. The person is reported to be Anthony DeChellis, CEO of Private Banking US at the large bank from 2006 until spring 2013. DeChellis’ statements raise doubts about a correction which resulted in several billions of dollars being written down as a net inflow. Citing Bloomberg, the newspaper states that the SEC has opened a case against Credit Suisse in the matter. The case concerns the assets of Hansjörg Wyss, founder of Synthes, which were written down by Credit Suisse as a net inflow in 2012, and were then transferred between the United States and Switzerland. For Credit Suisse, this meant a significant outflow in Switzerland became a net inflow to the United States. The information is reported to have been supplied by DeChellis, the newspaper states.
