Henderson takes the “gates” off its hedge funds


Investment Europe is reporting that Henderson has removed the possibility of limiting redemptions (known as a “gate”) for its AlphaGen Rhocas fund. The fund is part of the AlphaGen range taken over by Henderson with the acquisition of Gartmore. Paul Graham, global head of hedge funds, has announced that “gating” rules will be removed from all hedge funds except the AlphaGen Volantis, a fund specialised in British small caps. Gates have been removed for the Rhocas fund for more than a week; they will be removed from other funds gradually, at meetings of their respective boards of trustees.The manager says most hedge funds of the brand operate on deep enough markets to be encashed within three days if need be. Graham also says that some hedge funds currently in the process of being launched will allow investors a choice between share classes with or without a gate (which generally limits redemptions to 25%).
