AllianceBernstein announces commercial real estate division


AllianceBernstein has announced the creation of a real estate investment division, which will be led by Brahm Cramer and Jay Nydick. Cramer, who will join the Axa affiliate in first quarter 2010, was co-head of real estate principal investment at Goldman Sachs Group. Nydick has been president of iStar Financial since 2004. The product range will be “opportunistic,” and will initially focus on the commercial real estate market in the United States. The new division, which will be operational from the middle of next year, will be aimed at high net worth private clients and institutional investors.
