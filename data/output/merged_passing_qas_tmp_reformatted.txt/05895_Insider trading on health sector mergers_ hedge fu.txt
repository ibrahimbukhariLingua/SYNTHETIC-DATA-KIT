Insider trading on health sector mergers: hedge funds face questioning


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Wall Street Journal reports that several hedge funds involved in an investigation by Federal authorities into potential insider trading made large bets on health sector equities. SAC Capital Advisors, Diamondback Capital Management, Jana Partners, Balyasny Asset Management and Citadel made significant increases to their investments in companies involved in mergers and acquisitions, and shares which posed strong increases at the time of these transactions. The mergers included the acquisition of MedImmune by Astra Zeneca in 2007, and in 2009, the acquisitions of Schering-Plough by Merck, and Wyeth by Pfizer. However, the newspaper reports, SEC filings did not make it possible to know with precision if the shares concerned were acquired before or after the announcement of these deals. The US federal authorities are planning to bring some charges that could involve consultants, investment banks, hedge fund and mutual fund traders, and analysts. Another arm of the investigation will determine to what extent Goldman Sachs and other banks may have provided information about the mergers and acquisitions under preparation in the health sector, in ways that benefited some investors.
