Hedge funds struggle to gain back lost ground


Hedge fund clients of Credit Suisse currently have leverage of 2.5 times, compared with 2.4 times at the low point just after the crisis, while their cash holdings have fallen to 22% from 25% last summer, the Financial Times reports. However, two thirds of hedge funds are still below their high watermark, and 13% have earned no performance commissions since at least 2007.
