IOSCO launches a consultation on ETFs


The International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) on 14 March announced that it is launching a consultation on regulations applicable to ETF funds («Principles for the Regulation of Exchange Traded Funds»), which will review regulatory issues related to ETFs. The IOSCO document also proposes 15 principles on the basis of which the sector and regulators may evaluate the quality of regulations and pracrtices at firms, in three major areas: investor protection, proper functioning of markets, and financial stability. The principles proposed by IOSCO concern ETFs which are formatted as collective investment schemes (CIS), and do not apply to other ETPs which do not adopt this structure. The consultation is open to all interested parties until 27 June.
