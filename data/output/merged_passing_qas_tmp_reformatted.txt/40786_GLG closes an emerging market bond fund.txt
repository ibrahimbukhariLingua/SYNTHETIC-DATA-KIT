GLG closes an emerging market bond fund


GLG is cutting back. The alternative management firm has decided to close one of its bond funds focused on emerging markets, entitled Emerging Markets Currency & Fixed Income Alternative Fund, Citywire reveals. The vehicle is far from having the success expected for it. In fact, it lost 1.92% in first half 2013, after modest gains of 0.69% in 2012, and a loss of 1.27% in 2011. Meanwhile, the fund has melted away like snow in the sunlight, shrinking from about GBP30bn (EUR36.1m) at the beginning of 2013, to less than GBP5m (EUR6m) at the time of its closing on 31 December 2013. The website reports that GLG had already closed an emerging market fund in August last year.
