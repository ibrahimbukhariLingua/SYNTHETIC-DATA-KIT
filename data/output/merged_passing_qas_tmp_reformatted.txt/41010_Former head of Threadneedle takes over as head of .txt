Former head of Threadneedle takes over as head of a consulting firm


Simon Davies, former chairman of Threadneedle, has been recruited by the investment consultancy firm Square Mile Investment Research as chairman. He had previously been chairman of J.P. Morgan Overseas Investment Trust. Davies had previously served 16 years at Threadneedle, first as chief investment officer, then as CEO, and lastly, as chairman, a position he resigned from in June 2012.
