Aberdeen cleans house in Frankfurt


Hartmut Leser, board member in charge of distribution at Aberdeen Asset Management Deutschland AG (Aberdeen Deutschland) has been promoted to the position of head of Aberdeen for Germany, and chairman of the board at Aberdeen Deutschland. In this latter position he replaces Patrick Walker, head of European Business Development activities for Aberdeen Asset Management, who will now be able to return to London, as the integration of Degi has been completed. Michael Determann will assist Leser as chairman of the executive board at Aberdeen Immobilien KAG (ex DEGI). The board of directors will include Leser and Fabian Klingler, as well as Roger Welz. Klingler will be in charge of fund and asset management. Nico Tates, head of real estate fund management for continental Europe, becomes a member of the supervisory board at Aberdeen KAG, and will serve as international transaction manager and will also coordinate real estate fund management between Frankfurt and the other Aberdeen offices. The appointments were announced at the same time that the resignation of Bärbel Schomberg, chairwoman of the executive board at Aberdeen Immobilien KAG, “for personal convenience,” was announced. Schomberg was also head of Continental Europe at Aberdeen Property Investors. Malcolm Morgan will also be resigning his post as international transaction manager for personal convenience. The two departures come one month after the announcement that the portfolio of the real estate fund DEGI Global Business was written down by 21.6% (see Newsmanagers of 9 February and full article on 11 February). Redemptions from the DEGI Europa and DEGI International funds are still suspended.
