Skandia refocuses Skandia UK Best Ideas Fund


Concerned by the disappointing relative performance of the fund when markets rose strongly last year, SIG CIO James Millard and his team have been heavily scrutinising the line-up and blending of the managers to ensure the fund is better placed to deliver more consistent outperformance. As a result, the fund will now have exposure to the following managers – Audrey Ryan at Aegon; Jacob de Tusch-Lec at Artemis; Richard Plackett at BlackRock; Luke Kerr at Old Mutual; Richard Buxton at Schroders, Hector Kilpatrick at SVM and George Luckraft at AXA Framlington. Out of the UK Best Ideas line up goes the Ignis Cartesian duo of Andrew Kelly and David Stevenson; Jupiter’s Anthony Nutt and River & Mercantile’s Dan Hanbury. SIG is also dropping Hanbury from Its Global Best Ideas Fund and replacing him with Luke Kerr from Old Mutual Asset Management. Separately, Skandia investment Group’s long / short equity fund – the Skandia UK Strategic Best Ideas Fund – is reducing the number of managers in the line-up to seven.
