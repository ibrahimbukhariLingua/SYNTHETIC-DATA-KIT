ESMA publishes recommendations on short-selling and CDS


In response to a European Commission request, the European Securities and Markets Authority has published on June 3 its Technical Advice evaluating the impact of regulation on short selling and certain aspects of credit default swaps on European financial markets.Notwithstanding the review’s limitations in terms of data and timespan, the Esma has found that there were mixed effects on liquidity of EU stocks, with a slight decline in volatily, a decrease in bid-ask spreads and no significant impact on traded volumes. No compelling impact on the liquidity of EU single name CDS and on the related sovereign bonds markets could be noticed. The liquidity in European sovereign CDS indices has been somewhat reduced.The technical advice key recommendations include : some technical improvements in the method for calculating net short positions in shares and a change of the method of calculation of net short positions in sovereign debt; an alternative approach to draw up this list of shares exempted from the regulation on the basis of turnover calculations. The Esma also suggests emergency measures in case of a significant fall in price.
