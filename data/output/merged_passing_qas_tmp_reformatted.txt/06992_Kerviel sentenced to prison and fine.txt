Kerviel sentenced to prison and fine


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The former Société Générale trader Jérôme Kerviel, who was sued for a record loss of nearly EUR5bn in early 2008, was sentenced on Tuesday to five years in prison, of which he will be required to serve at least three, and ordered to pay EUR4.9bn in damages to the bank, corresponding to the amount lost in early 2008. His lawyer announced that he would appeal the verdict. The president of the 11th chamber of the Paris correctional court, Dominique Pauthe, found Jérôme Kerviel guilty of all three charges against him: abuse of trust, forgery and computer abuse. The former trader “overstepped his duties by taking speculative positions on behalf of the bank, and in gigantic proportions,” the court found after more than three months of deliberations.
