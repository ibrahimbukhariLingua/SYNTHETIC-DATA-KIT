SEC plans to impose charges on high frequency trading


Following a similar move by the CFTC, the Securities and Exchange Commission is planning to take measures to limit the significant influence of high-frequency traders on equity markets, the Wall Street Journal reports. The SEC is considering imposing fees on the numerous buy and sell orders which are cancelled before execution, among other proposals. According to estimates, 95% to 98% of orders issued by high-frequency traders are cancelled.
