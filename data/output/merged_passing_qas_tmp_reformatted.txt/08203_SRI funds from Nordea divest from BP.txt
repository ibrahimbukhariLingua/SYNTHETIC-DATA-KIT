SRI funds from Nordea divest from BP


The Nordea Responsible Investments (RI) Committee on June 4 2010 decided to divest from BP in the Nordea dedicated RI funds and mandates. Further on it was decided to suspend further investments in BP for all other Nordea funds until clarification from BP on systematic risk management has been evaluated. In total, some 20 Nordea funds available in the Nordic countries with BP investments are directly affected. The decision of the RI Committee was taken due to: the company has failed to comply with its own safety and environmental rules according to the informations available; the company does not disclose information and is not transparent regarding how other similar operations are managed from a safety and environmental perspective The RIG team (Responsible Investments & Governance) within Nordea is also currently conducting thorough analysis on the oil & gas sector companies in order to identify systematic safety and environmental risks associated with deep water drilling operations, adds Nordea.
