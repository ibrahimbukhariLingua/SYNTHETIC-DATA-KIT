MSCI offers EM index of non-BRIC countries


With the MSCI EM Beyond BRIC, MSCI has launched a new emerging market index which covers 17 countries, but excludes the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), which currently represent over 40% of the MSCI Emerging Markets index. The new product was developed at the request of clients, and may be used for fnancial supports such as ETFs or structured products.In order to diversify the index, MSCI has decided to limit the allocation to Taiwan and South Korea to 15%, which gives more weight to smaller emerging markets such as Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.Backtesting reveals that the new index would have outperformed the MSCI Emerging Markets index since 1999, with annualised gross performance in US dollars of 12%, compared with 11.1%. Between 1999 and 2007, it would have lagged 2.1 percentage points behind, with 18%, compared with 20.1%, but since 2007, the new index would have earned annualised returns of 2.85%, at a time when the Emerging Markets index lost 2.1%.Weightings as of 31 July 2013:South Africa: 15.78%Chile: 3.90%Colombia: 2.76%South Korea: 15.03%Egypt: 0.58%Hungary: 0.50%Indonesia: 6.59%Malaysia: 8.92%Morocco: 0.18%Mexico: 12.45%Peru: 0.98%Philippines: 2.42%Poland: 3.72%Czech Republic: 0.54%Taiwan: 15.33%Thailand: 6.11%Turkey: 4.22%
