Anaxis AM adds to range of target tade bond funds


Anaxis Asset Management (Anaxis AM), an affiliate of the Anaxis group specialised in bond management, has announced the launch of European Bond Opp. 2022, a new bond fund maturing on 31 December 2022. The new vehicle will invest in corporate bonds from industrial and non-financial sectors, mostly in Europe, with maturities near 2022, the asset management firm says in a statement. The managers will operate according to a fundamental credit analysis approach. The new UCITS fund, which succeeds the Anaxis Bond Opportunity Europe 2018, will aim for annualised net returns 3% higher than those of 2022 German government bonds.
