The French financial market regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), and the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) late in the evening of 11 August announced an initiative to combat short-selling. The president of the AMF, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, acting pursuant to article L. 421-16 II of the monetary and financial code, has decided to forbid all net short positions or increases of any existing such positions, including moves during the trading day, by any individuals residing or based in France or abroad, on shares in capital or providing access to the capital of the following credit and insurance businesses: April Group, Axa BNP Paribas, CIC, CNP Assurances, Crédit Agricole, Euler Hermès, Natixis, Paris Ré, Scor, Société Générale. “This measure will apply as soon as it appears on the AMF website, this evening at 10:45 PM, for a duration of 15 days. It may be extended, under the conditions set forth in article L. 421-16 II, cited above. It does not apply to financial intermediaries acting as market-makers or as providers of liquidity as signatories to a contract with the market business or the issuer, or as counterparties for blocs of shares,” the AMF states. The ESMA also states that, in addition to France, Belgium, Italy and Spain have also taken similar measures.
