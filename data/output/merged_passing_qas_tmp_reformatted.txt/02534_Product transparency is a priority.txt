Product transparency is a priority


In an interview with L’Agefi Switzerland, Volker Buschmann, head of the British management firm M&G for sale sin southern Europe (including Switzerland) states that in Switzerland, private clients are very reticent about structured products. “The discussion is centred on the advantages of active or passive management of their assets,” he explains. “Passive products such as Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) represent a form of competition in the current environment. Family offices have also made a change of orientation, concentrating once again on long-only investments, and moving away from investments in hedge funds or structured products. Now, ‘soft benefits’ are becoming a more noticeable presence: performance is no longer the main argument in the choice of a fund; transparency is what counts in a product.”
