Credit Suisse unveils changes to legal structure


On November 21st, Credit Suisse Group announced its programme to evolve its legal entity structure to meet developing and future regulatory requirements. This has been prepared in discussion with the Swiss regulator Finma and will address regulations in Switzerland (Banking Ordinance), the United States (the Federal Reserve’s Enhanced Prudential Standards for Foreign Banking Organizations) and the United Kingdom (Recovery and Resolution Planning), according to a press release.Credit Suisse’s legal entity structure currently consists of a global branch network, primarily used for its private banking business, and three main subsidiaries, primarily used for its investment banking business. In the future, the group will more closely align the booking of its investment banking business to the region in which it originates from a client and risk management perspective.These changes are designed to both meet future requirements for global recovery and resolution planning and result in a substantially less complex and more efficient operating infrastructure for the bank. Furthermore, Swiss banking law provides for the possibility of a limited reduction in capital requirements in the event of an improvement in resolvability which this program intends to deliver.As for Switzerland, Credit Suisse plans to set up a subsidiary for its local booked business, mainly wealth management, retal and corporate and institutional clients, as well as the product & sales hub in Switzerland.The group also intends to create a separately capitalized global infrastructure legal entity in Switzerland and a US subsidiary of Credit Suisse USA Inc. In principle, these will include all Shared Services functions.The two main operations in the UK, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd and Credit Suisse International, will be consolidated into one single entity. Non-European business will be transferred to the appropriate entities in the Americas, primarily Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and in Asia-Pacific, though the Singapore branch.The release also states that the implementation of this program is «well under way», with a number of key components to be implemented from mid-2015. Once the final legal framework is agreed, Credit Suisse plans to issue bail-in eligible debt out of the group holoding company, Credit Suisse Group AG «ton enable a single point of entry bail-in resolution strategy». .
