We have spent significant time and effort developing the business since it was acquired more than ten years ago. To remain competitive and further develop this business and its customers, it would require investments in local distribution capacity. I am therefore convinced that Danske Bank, as one of the largest banks in Denmark and with a broad local distribution and life insurance operation will be the best possible home for this business», Johan Torgeby, SEB’s president and CEO comments on the transaction.
