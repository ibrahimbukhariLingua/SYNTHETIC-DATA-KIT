High fees weigh down returns, according to Vanguard


Vanguard has published a new report showing that excessive fees are penalising performance for UK investors, Financial Times fund management reports. The least expensive quartile of funds domiciled in the United Kingdom outperformed the most expensive fund quartile in 9 categories out of 11 in the past 10 years. The performance gap was the largest for emerging market equity funds. In this category, the average cheapest fund earned 12.3% after fees, 3.1 points better than the most expensive fund.
