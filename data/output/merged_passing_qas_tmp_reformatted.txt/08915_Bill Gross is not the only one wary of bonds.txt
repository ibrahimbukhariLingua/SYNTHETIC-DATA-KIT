Bill Gross is not the only one wary of bonds


According to Emerging Portfolio Fund Research, net subscriptions to bond funds worldwide this year have already totalled USD89bn, nearly five times the total for the first three months of 2009, Die Welt reports. Bill Gross, who manages a bond fund with USD214.3bn in assets at Pimco (Allianz Gobal Investors), has warned that the rally on bonds, which has lasted for more than three decades, is nearing its end. Pimco announced in December that it will be launching equities funds, and recommends positions on government bonds with low deficits, such as Germany and Canada, or else investment in corporate bonds. Gross is not the only manager to be preaching prudence: Bill Eigen, manager of the JP Morgan Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (USD8bn), is predicting rising interest rates in the next two years, which will mean losses for subscribers to long-term bond funds. And Keith Harstein, CEO of John Hancock Funds, says small investors have already almost missed the right time to back out of bond funds. They are now once again making the mistake of betting on past performance, at a time when they need to be making investment decisions for today.
