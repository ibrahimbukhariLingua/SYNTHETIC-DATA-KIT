Edrim opts for an ultra-prudent policy for absolute return


Benjamin Melman, director of the absolute return unit at Edmond de Rothschild Investment Managers (Edrim), who is in charge of the management of the Quadrim 4 and Quadrim 8 funds, has announced that assets in the funds have fallen by about EUR100m since the beginning of the year, due to losses of 0.5% for the former and 2.86% for the latter fund, which are honourable results in light of the highly adverse evolution of the markets, and the skittish mood of some segments of clients.The only current directional bet is a 6% allocation to emerging markets, which the manager admits was made a bit early, although positions have been reduced since. However, “the discount of emerging markets, following a major correction, has returned to its levels at the beginning of the last decade, and emerging markets equities are really inexpensive.” In general, Melman says that he has adopted an «ultra-prudent» management policy: he is not limiting himself to macro strategies, but is also using quantitative IT tools such as trend monitoring and currency volatility. He adds that “the only real way to diversify is not over asset classes but over styles;” and Edrim constantly deploys ten strategies.
