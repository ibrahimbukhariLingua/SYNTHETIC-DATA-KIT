Julius Baer seeking acquisitions in wealth management


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Swiss group Julius Baer is seeking to participate in consolidation in the banking sector in Switzerland, and potentially to make acquisitions if the opportunity presents itself, CEO Boris Collardi says in an interview with Le Temps. “Switzerland is undergoing a consolidation. If there are other banks for sale in wealth management, we will be candidates,” says Collardi, adding that the Swiss market is the largest for the banking group, and that they are continuing to invest. According to the CEO, the bank has, however, set “three conditions for an acquisition: critical size, a client base compatible with our notions of quality, and the absence of an auction process which might drive prices up.” After Switzerland, “the second market is Europe, where we have acquire Commerzbank in Luxdembourg, to increase our future operating margins. We will decide in the next 12 to 18 moonths whether our European centre will be in Germany or Luxembourg,” says Collardi. “The third area is fast-growing markets, such as Asia, with 25% of assets under management,” the head of Julius Baer continues. After several acquisitions last year, including Commerzbank International Luxembourg, Fransad Gestion, and a majority stake in Italy’s Kairos, the group will pursue “a strategy of organic growth or growth through acquisitions in these three markets,” says Collardi.
