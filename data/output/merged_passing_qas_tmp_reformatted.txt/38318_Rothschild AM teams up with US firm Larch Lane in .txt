Rothschild AM teams up with US firm Larch Lane in alternative management


The Rothschild group is accelerating its development in the area of alternative management. Rothschild Asset Management (AM) Inc, its US affiliate, on 24 April, announced that it is founding a joint venture with the US firm Larch Lane Advisors, a firm specialised in the construction of personalised alternative portfolios. The joint venture, entitled Rothschild Larch Lane Management Company LLC, will operate as an investment adviser for liquid hedge fund multi-managers under the US structure known as “40 Act,” which uses a risk-balanced approach in portfolio construction. Under their agreement, “Rothschild and Larch Lane will share their long experience in multi-manager hedge funds, and the joint venture will combine experts at both companies in investment in hedge funds,” the two partners say in a joint statement. A preliminary prospectus for a “40 Act mutual fund” has already been submitted, the two partners say.
