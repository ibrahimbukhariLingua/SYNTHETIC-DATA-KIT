ERAFP launches request for proposals for renewed equities mandates


The French pension fund for public sector employees Etablissement de retraite additionnelle de la fonction publique (ERAFP) has launched a restricted request for proposals for renewed financial management mandates for “mid- and large cap publicly traded equities in Euro zone businesses” and diversification of its asset allocation. The request for proposals is composed of four rounds (corresponding to four types of mandates, respectively): a round for small and midcap publicly-traded shares in Euro zone businesses, with index-based management, and three rounds of publicly-traded Euro zone mid and large caps, the first of which will involve index-based management, the second will use active benchmarked management, and the third will be unbenchmarked. The mandates will be for an initial three-year term, and may be renewed once, for a new three-year term. In keeping with the 100% SRI investment policy of the pension fund, the new mandates will integrate the SRI regime, adapted to each case.
