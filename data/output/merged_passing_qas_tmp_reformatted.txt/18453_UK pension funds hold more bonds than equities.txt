UK pension funds hold more bonds than equities


UK pension funds have more bonds than equities in their portfolios for the first time since the concept of the cult of equities first appeared in the 1950s, the Financial Times reports. The Pensions Regulator, which compiled data on 6,316 defined-benefit retirement plans, reports that British funds are 43.2% invested in bonds, compared with 38.5% in equities.
