Change in shareholder structure on the table for DNCA Finance


Rumours that the Banca Leonardo group may soon be abandoning its asset management business in France, selling off a part of its stake in DNCA Finance to a US investment fund, may die out this week. According to information obtained by Newsmanagers, the asset management firm based in the rue de la Paix in Paris must decide by 20 May whether or not to sign an agreement for an entry into its capital by one of the oldest private equity funds, TA Associates. The private equity fund already holds 16 stakes in asset management firms. If the two parties reach an agreement, TA Associates would become the largest shareholder in the firm, with a larger stake than Jean-Charles MÃ©riau, chief investment officer (see Newsmanagers of 7 April 2011) and Jacques Chatel, chairman.
