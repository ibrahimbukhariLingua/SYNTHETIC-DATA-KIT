iShares preparing diversifying products based on ETFs


Joseph Linhares, managing director, has announced that iShares is currently considering launching ETFs of equity and bond ETFs.The head of the firm for the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region has revealed that the asset management firm is considering importing asset allocation solutions to Europe based on quantitative models, which would invest in ETFs without necessarily being ETFs themselves. iShares may also design products using fundamental methods, but that would probably pose both legal and industrial secrecy issues, related to timing disclosure of the composition of portfolios so as not to reveal the alpha signal too quickly. But this would be something near active management...However, Linhares is hostile to the notion of launching reverse and/or leveraged ETFs, which may be dangerous for retail investors, who find it difficult to understand the methodology and performance of these products over the long term.
