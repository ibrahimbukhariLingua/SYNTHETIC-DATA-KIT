Emerging markets: Mark Mobius (Franklin Templeton) lays out the main principles


Mark Mobius, a specialist in emerging markets at Franklin Templeton, has recently celebrated the 40thanniversary of his career investing in these markets. To confront the current economic situation, which is characterized by volatility that continues to affect emerging financial markets, Mobius says it is very important “that investors keep several fundamental principles in mind.” Among these principles, Mobius cites diversification. The best move, he says, is to invest in diversified investment funds. In terms of geographical exposure, he says, “no country has a monopoly on good opportunities,” and for that reason, an international viewpoint must be maintained. The third virtue of a wise investor in these markets is patience. “Don’t wait for immediate gains: the best investors are the ones who adopt a long-term perspective,” the manager says. Lastly, Mobius recommends that investors place their money only in things that they genuinely understand.
