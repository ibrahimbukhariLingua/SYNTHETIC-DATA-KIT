AMF issues warning over Keystone Fund


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The French financial market authority (Autorité des marchés financiers, AMF) has warned French investors against the “Keystone Fund,” a fund which is not authorised for sale in France. “Keystone Fund” is an alternative investment fund (FIA) – Specialized Investment Fund (SIF) registered in Luxembourg, with 2 sub-funds: Keystone Real Estate Placement and Keys Placement. The product has been offered for sale to French retail and professional investors, via intermediaries and financial investment advisers (CIF). However, the Sicav is not licensed for sale in France, counter to what is stated in the sales documentation. The Luxembourg Sicav “Keystone Fund” has not to date satisfied the conditions to qualify for the European passport, and so to be sold to professional investors in France, the AMF states. Moreover, the product can in no case be sold to non-professional investors. The AMF also draws the attention of investors to the fact that the presentation documents for the “Keystone Fund” product and its two sub-funds, which are used as sales materials, contain “unclear or misleading” information.
