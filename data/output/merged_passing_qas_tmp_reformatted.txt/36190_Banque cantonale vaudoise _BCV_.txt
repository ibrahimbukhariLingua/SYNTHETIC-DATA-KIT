Banque cantonale vaudoise (BCV)


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } The Banque cantonale vaudoise (BCV) on 26 August announced in a statement that it has “to date” sent no names of employees to the US tax authorities as part of a settlement of a legal action related to taxation. The identity of employees who oppose the sending of their data will be disclosed at the end of the appeal process in the Swiss courts. “At this stage, no names of employees have been sent to the US authorities. It goes without saying that the names of any employees who oppose the disclosure of their names will be sent, where applicable, to the US authorities only after the conclusion of the appeal procedure before the Swiss courts, and in no case before that,” the firm writes. The bank notes that it “respects and will fully respect the procedures (of the Swiss federal authorities) and the rights of its employees.” BCV has set up an assistance cell for employees concerned. Only the names of members of the board of directors, the board of directors and some department heads have been sent “with their explicit consent.” The bank is reacting to reports in the press that names of employees had been transferred to the US authorities.
