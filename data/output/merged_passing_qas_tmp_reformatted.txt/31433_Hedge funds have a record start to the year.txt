Hedge funds have a record start to the year


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } First quarter 2013 will go down in history as one of the best ever for some hedge funds, despite ongoing concerns on the economic front, the Financial Times reports. Some are even predicting that it may bring a return to grace for the sector. For example, Lansdowne Partners, the largest equity hedge fund in Europe, has seen a 7.75% increase for its flagship fund in the first two months of the year. The flagship fund by Crispin Odey, head of Odey Asset Management, has gained 11% this year.
