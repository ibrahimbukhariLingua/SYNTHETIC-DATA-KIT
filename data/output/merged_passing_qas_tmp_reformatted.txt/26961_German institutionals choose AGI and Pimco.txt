German institutionals choose AGI and Pimco


German institutional investors are adjusting investment strategies and portfolio allocations in an attempt to generate yield amid low interest rates and declining return expectations. As they do so, they give top marks to Allianz Global Investors and PIMCO, another Allianz affiliate, according to the «2013 Greenwich Quality Leaders in German Investment Management». Greenwich interviewed somme 250 institutions for this year’s surveyWith German institutions currently devoting more than three quarters of investment capital to “return-seeking” as opposed to “liability-matching” assets, asset return expectations are the most important key driver behind significant allocation changes. As part of their efforts to enhance returns in an environment that remains very risk sensitive, they are increasingly diversifying their portfolios and reshaping the fixed-income landscape for institutional investors.Expectations that the current low-interest rate environment will persist longer-term have prompted a dramatic extension of duration with institutions now report holding virtually no fixed-income assets with less than five years duration. Expectations to decrease Government Bond exposure further also continue, with Emerging Market debt, High Yield and Active Global Bonds anticipated to continue to be beneficiaries over a three-year time horizon.Expectations that this diversification trend would also benefit alternatives appear yet to materialize, as regulatory and structural challenges persist. However, a net +26% of investors still expect to significantly increase infrastructure exposure in the next three years and a net +25% plan to meaningfully increase allocations to real estate.
