Investor cutback in new market bets is most severe since 2008


The investor pullback from the asset-management industry in 2018 is the most severe since the last financial crisis, a sign that doubts about the direction of global markets are intensifying, says The Wall Street Journal. Net inflows forU.S. mutual and exchange-traded funds in the first 11 months of the year fell to $237 billion, according to new estimates compiled by research firm Morningstar. That was down 62% from the year-ago period, the steepest decline since 2008. Asset managers attracted a record $629.5 billion in net flows during the same period in 2017, a boom year for the industry. The pullback was evident at indexing pioneer Vanguard, which started the first index mutual fund for individual investors more than four decades ago. The firm collected net inflows of $208.3 billion in the 11 months ended Nov. 30, down about 40% from the same year-ago period. It was the lowest amount of combined net inflows across index and actively managed strategies during that period for Vanguard since 2013.
