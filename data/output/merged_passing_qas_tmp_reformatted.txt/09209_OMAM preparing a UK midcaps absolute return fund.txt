OMAM preparing a UK midcaps absolute return fund


Old Mutual Asset Managers (OMAM) is planning to launch the Old Mutual UK Specialist Absolute Return fund in May. The Irish-registered product will comply with the UCITS III directive, will offer daily liquidity, and will be managed by Luke Kerr. The product will invest primarily in UK midcaps which are not part of the FTSE 100 index. Management will follow that of the long/short hedge fund Old Mutual UK Specialist Equity, launched in March 2003 and registered in the Cayman Islands.
