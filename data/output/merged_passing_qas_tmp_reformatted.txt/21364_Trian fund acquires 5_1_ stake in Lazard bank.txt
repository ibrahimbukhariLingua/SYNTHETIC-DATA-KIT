Trian fund acquires 5.1% stake in Lazard bank


The US investment fund Trian Fund Management on 18 June announced that it has amassed a stake of about 5.1% in the French-American bank Lazard, to become one of the bankâ€™s largest shareholders. Trian, which has acquired 6.3 million ordinary shares in Lazard, claims in a statement that the bank is a top-calibre global financial services business with a high-value brand. The Lazard model, based on commissions, is positioned to naturally profit from long-term financial market trends. Trian supports the new strategic plan at Lazard, unveiled on 27 April, which focuses on increasing margins, and estimates that Lazard shares are significantly undervalued.
