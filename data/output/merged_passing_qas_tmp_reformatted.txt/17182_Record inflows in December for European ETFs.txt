Record inflows in December for European ETFs


Equities ETFs listed in Europe attracted USD803m last week, and a record total of USD2.1bn, TrimTabs Invesment Research announced on 3 January. European equities funds listed in the United States, for their part, posted inflows equivalent to 0.4% of assets last week.This marked interest in ETFs may be a sign that retail investor confidence may be excessive, TrimTabs says. This is all the more so as inflows to equities ETFs in the United States are a strong indicator of a contrarian trend: in other words, the recent rise in inflows may represent a negative sign for equities.
