IPM winds down long-only equity strategy


IPM Informed Portfolio Management, the systematic asset manager in which Catella’s direct and indirect ownership amounts to 60.6 per cent, has decided to shut down its Systematic Equity product and focus on its flagship Systematic Macro strategy. “We have seen tremendous growth in our flagship Systematic Macro strategy, while the environment for our Systematic Equity strategy has been challenging for some time,” says Lars Ericsson, acting CEO for IPM. “This is why we have taken the strategic decision to close down the long-only equity unit.” The IPM Systematic Equity strategy was launched 13 years ago. Assets under management in Systematic Equity amounted to SEK28bn at the end of March 2019. The strategy has been primarily value based, an area that has struggled,at a time inflows into passive management strategies have boosted expensive stocks already. Thepressure on fees in the long-only space has also ledthe product tonow only representing a very marginal part of the Systematic Funds revenues and profitability. “The long-only equity business has been tying up resources, without really contributing much to the diversification of fixed revenues. Because we don’t see demand picking up any time soon, we believe that it’s in the best interest of our clients and our business that we focus on our more successful and profitable core macro area. In parallel, we will continue to evaluate other more competitive strategies as complements.” Systematic Funds has experienced very strong growth in its core macro area over the past few years and is now managing around SEK50bn in this strategy for clients worldwide. The firm has also opened offices in London and New York and launched its own UCITS umbrella.
