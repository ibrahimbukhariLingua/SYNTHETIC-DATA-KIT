Ossiam releases six strategy ETFs, one of them exclusively for France


As Newsmanagers announced last week, Ossiam, the asset management firm of the Natixis GAM group specialised in strategy ETFs, on Monday 4 July released its first six equities ETFs for sale on NYSE Euronext in Paris. Five of the funds, sub-funds of the firm’s Luxembourg-registered Sicav, have been listed since 27 June for trading on the XTF segment of the Xetra electronic trading platform from Deutsche Börse, while the French market is the exclusive outlet for the Ossiam ETF CAC 40 Equal Weight NR.The latter fund belongs to the range of equally weighted index-based funds with net dividends reinvested which attributes equal weight to each share at rebalancing, regardless fothe cap size of the companies, unlike the classic index, in which market capitalisation determines the weight of companies. In practice, at each quarterly rebalancing, all businesses weigh 2.5%. With the other funds of the equally-weighted index strategies, the principle is identical. For the Ossiam ETF EURO STOXX 50® Equal Weight NR, each share weighs 2%; for the Ossiam ETF STOXX® EUROPE 600 Equal weight NR, shares represent 0.1667% each at each rebalancing – quarterly in both cases.The other family includes ETFs which follow the Minimum Variance strategy. The objective is to offer investors average volatility of lower by more than 30% than the benchmark universe, which is a de facto limit on drawdowns. The non-discretionary quantitative approach of the management firm has led it to develop the strategy index iStoxx Europe Minimum Variance (dividends reinvested) on the basis of the Stoxx Europe 600 index, which represents a “dynamic sample of the 300 most liquid equities, weighted in such a way as to minimise the volatility of the portfolio». For Ossiam ETF US Minimum Variance NR, the benchmark index is based on a dynamic sample of the 250 most liquid equities of the S&P 500 index. The strategy index is adjusted each month on a fixed date, the third Friday of the month.
