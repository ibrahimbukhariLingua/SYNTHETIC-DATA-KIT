Schroders France poaches two from Axa IM


Schroders has recruited two former employees of Axa Investment Managers for its sales teams based in Paris. Aurore Wannesson-Raynaud, who had previously been director, senior product specialist, fixed income at Axa IM, has been appointed as head of sales for institutional clients. She will report to Mustapha Bouheraoua, director of institutional clients at Schroders France. Thomas Strievi, who had served as product specialist at AXA IM in the Invesments Solutions division, becomes head of commercial distribution. He will report to Alexandre Gabus, director of distribution at Schroders France. The recruitments, which were expected, follow a reorganisation of the sales team at Schroders in Paris (see Newsmanagers of 27 April 2011).
