More bubbles to come in the future


The chief strategist at Feri Finance, Heinz-Werner Rapp, predicts that there will be “more shocks than in the past on capital markets.” In an interview with Handelsblatt, Rapp predicts that speculative bubbles will be more numerous than in the past, as economic problems have not been resolved and there is far too much money in circulation. “We are in the very early stages of a bond bubble,” says Rapp.
