Jupiter AM to launch a European absolute returns fund


Jupiter Asset Management is to launch a UCITS III fund for investors seeking to capture returns from investing in pan-European equities. The Jupiter European Absolute Return (Sicav), which launches in January, will seek to generate an absolute return independent of market conditions. In seeking to meet the objective, the manager will aim to limit volatility. The Fund, a sub-fund of the Luxembourg-domiciled Jupiter Global Fund, will be managed by two of Jupiter’s fund managers - Cédric de Fonclare and Stephen Pearson. This marks the first time that the long/short investment capabilities of Stephen Pearson will be made available to investors in a regulated environment. The managers’ investment process will be based upon fundamental ‘bottom up’ stock-picking. They will look to build a portfolio of 50-80 long and short positions in individual companies in the European markets. Directional exposure to the equity markets will therefore be more a function of decisions taken on individual companies rather than top down positioning based on macro economic views.
