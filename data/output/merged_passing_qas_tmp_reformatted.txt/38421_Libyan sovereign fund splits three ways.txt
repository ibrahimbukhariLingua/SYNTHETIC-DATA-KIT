Libyan sovereign fund splits three ways


The Libyan sovereign fund, which has USD66bn in assets, will split in three next year, Les Echos reports. One fund will be responsible for accumulating capital for future generations, another will be responsible for stabilising the budget, and a third will invest in local projects (infrastructure, transportation, etc.). The reshuffle comes a few days after a decision by the sovereign fund to place nearly USD11bn with external asset management firms (see Newsmanagers of 18 April 2014).
