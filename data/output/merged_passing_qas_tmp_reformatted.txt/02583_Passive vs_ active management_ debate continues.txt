Passive vs. active management: debate continues


According to a study by S&P cited by the WSJ, about 60% of equities fund managers lagged behind their index over five years to June 30. With the exception of emerging market debt funds, at least 75% of bond fund managers trailed behind their index. The news is grist for the mill of supporters of passive, index-based management. But Jane Li of FundQuest (BNP Paribas) says that “the less efficient the market, the more potential there is for a manager to add value.”
