Japan seeks to reform pension funds


A Japanese government working group has called on the GPIF and other public pension funds in the country to fundamentally restructure in order to improve their performance, diversify their exposure and revise their governance. The report from the working group, presented on 20 November to Prime Minister Chinzo Abe recommends that pension funds revise their investment objectives, with the objective of outperforming inflation, and thus of modifying allocations which are too exposed to Japanese bonds. Pension funds are also expected to plan to invest more over the long term, and thus to expose themselves more to high-risk assets, and thus to diversify into new asset classes, such as real estate funds, infrastructure, venture capital, private equity and commodities. The report discusses only hedge ufnds, btu according to a member of the working group, pension funds should consider other long-only allocations in high-risk portions of the bond or equity universes.
