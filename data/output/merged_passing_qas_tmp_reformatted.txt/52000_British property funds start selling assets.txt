British property funds start selling assets


British property funds start selling their buildings. Henderson Global Investors (Henderson GI) plans to sell 440 Strand, the headquarters of the private bank Coutts, by the end of 2016 as suspended property funds begin offloading prime assets to provide liquidity to investors, according to Financial Times. The property, bought for £175m in 2014, was valued at £220m before the Brexit vote and will be formally brought on to the market in the autumn by the suspended Henderson UK Property fund, according to two people briefed on the plans. According the british newspaper, the sale of 440 Strand is one of a number of disposals expected to follow the suspensions of seven property funds last week after investors rushed for the exit following the UK’s vote to leave the EU.
