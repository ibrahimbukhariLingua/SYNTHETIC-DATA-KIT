Rothschild &amp; Cie creates new vehicle for direct investments


Rothschild & Cie is creating a new vehicle, Five Arrows Principal Investment, with EUR584m in assets, for direct investment of ownersâ€™ equity (EUR20m to EUR60m) in mid-sized companies in Western Europe, Agefi reports. In sectoral terms, the firm claims to be generalist, although real estate and highly specialised sectors are excluded. The team, which will include 11 people, and which will eventually also feature a 12th, will be based half in Paris and half in London, the newspaper adds.
