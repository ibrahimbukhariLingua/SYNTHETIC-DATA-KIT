Asian ambitions threaten the European UCITS brand


The future development of an Asia-wide fund passporting solution is considered as a threat to Ucits for 90.4% of the 59 managers surveyed by Cerulli in July. In addition, the China-Hong Kong mutual recognition is viewed as a threat by 78.7% of managers.Regulators in Asia are considering ways of facilitating cross-border distribution in the region, either by creating a regional alternative to UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) or via bilateral agreements between countries. As Asia is currently the main importer of UCITS outside of Europe, industry practitioners are understandably concerned that these initiatives will one day become a reality. An immediate concern is negotiations between China and Hong Kong for the mutual recognition of mutual funds and unit trusts in each other’s jurisdiction. However, bilateral agreements might not necessarily work against UCITS. «There is nothing to stop China extending its offer to other domiciles such as Taiwan, Singapore, and even countries beyond Asia, such as Luxembourg,» noted Angelos Gousios, senior analyst at Cerulli Associates. «Chinese managers are keen to expand their presence in Europe. For that to happen, regulators in Europe would have to insist that UCITS is part of the deal and that providers be allowed access to China.» Barbara Wall, a Cerulli director, added, «Managers should not lose sight of the fact that Europe is still by far the largest market for UCITS, representing three-quarters of total cross-border UCITS assets. Asia-Pacific is the second-largest market but the region had only 15% marketshare at the end of 2012, a modest two percentage point increase since 2009."*The Cerulli Edge - European Monthly Product Trends Edition, October 2013 Issue.
