Investor outperforms Swedish stock market in 2016


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Swedish investment company Investor, controlled by the Wallenberg family, on 31 January announced that its net asset value has risen 3% in third quarter to top SEK300bn, or about EUR32bn. Investor says it earned returns of 13% for the year overall, compared with only 10% for the main index of the Stockholm stock market. “In the past few months, we have observed a few signs of improvement in economic outlooks. At the same time, political uncertainty remains high,” Johan Forssell, CEO of Investor, says in the report. Profits at the firm rose 93% last year, to SEK33.7bn, or about EUR3.5bn. The CEO says that the current strategy will be maintained, and will include strengthening stakes in the principal stock market investments selected, and additional investments in the private investment vehicle EQT.
