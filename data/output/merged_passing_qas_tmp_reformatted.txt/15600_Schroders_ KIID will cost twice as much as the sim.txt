Schroders: KIID will cost twice as much as the simplified prospectus


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Noel Fessey, managing director at Schroder Investment Management Luxembourg, estimates that the cost of deploying the Key Investor Information Document (KIID) required by the European UCITS IV Directive will be tquice as high as for the simplified prospectus under UCITS III, FundWeb (the new name of Fund Strategy) reports.The manager stated at the Alfi conference that Schroders will invest EUR1m to create a KIID for all its UCITS-compliant funds, compared with EUR0.5m in 2005 for the simplified prospectus. Fessey estimates that the British management firm will also dedicate EUR0.3m annually to maintaining the KIID documents.The high cost of the KIID is due to the fact that it involves several areas of activity at the management firm, including development, compliance, accounting, distribution and marketing, aside from costs related to retaining lawyers, consultants, writers and translators.Schroders is planning to shoulder the added cost of the documents without passing it on to investors.
