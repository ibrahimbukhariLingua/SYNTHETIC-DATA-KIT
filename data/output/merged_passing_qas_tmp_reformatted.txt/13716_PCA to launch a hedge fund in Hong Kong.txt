PCA to launch a hedge fund in Hong Kong


Reuters reports that PCA Investments (Principia Capital Advisors) has received a management license from the Hong Kong market regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), which allows it to launch and operate a hedge fund. The firm would initially like to offer a CTA strategy, which will bet on long-term market trend strategies, and will then launch equities and credit strategies during summer. The firm is planning to raise USD750m for the fund.
