Blair Pickerell leaves Morgan Stanley IM


Asian Investor reports that Blair Pickerell is leaving Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM) in Hong Kong, where he was managing director and CEO for Asia-Pacific. His departure is said to be due to a decision by Morgan Stanley to reduce its presence in retail activities, as illustrated by its sale of its US retail unit, Van Kampen Investments, to Invesco last year. Pickerell has said that he will soon take up another job in the asset management industry, but has not given any details.
