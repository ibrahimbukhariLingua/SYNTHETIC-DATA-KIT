Abante Asesores launches Kalahari Alpha


The Spanish management firm Abante Asesores has placed José Ramón Iturriaga in charge of the management of a second absolute return fund, in addition to Okavango Delta (which has returned 42% since the beginning of the year). The new product is entitled Kalahari Alpha, and will use the same approach, but with a more closely controlled maximal volatility limited to 9%. The performance objective is 200 basis points above the Euribor 1 year. Management and performance commissions are 1.25% and 9%, respectively. The manager may invest up to 30% in equities, while the remainder will be placed in repos and credit in order to limit risk.
