ING IM needs to develop in retail to survive


ING must offload its insurance and asset management arm by 2013. Jan Straatman, Global CIO of ING IM, is alive to the danger that, by stripping ING IM of the distribution benefits of a retail bank network, the asset manager could become overly reliant on its insurance division. “The very big risk of this development could be that we are moving back towards a much more captive asset manager. That in itself will have a negative influence, decreasing competitive pressure and the ability to attract and retain talent,” he says to the Financial Times Fund Management. "(…) We can only survive long term if we can prove we can develop this organisation, that we are not merely the captive asset manager of an insurance organisation. We have to work hard to attract retail assets,” he adds.
