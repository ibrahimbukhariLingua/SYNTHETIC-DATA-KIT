George Soros out to save the Euro


At a press conference in Berlin, George Soros has publicly expressed his opinion about the current Euro crisis. The European countries are doing precisely the opposite of what is needed to save the Euro: they are cutting spending, and that will plunge the continent into a deflationary spiral, led by Germany, he says in an interview in Die Welt am Sonntag. The monetary union is founded on German fears of inflation, but there is nothing to protect against the opposite problem, deflation, which is currently a danger. German paranoia about inflation is also paralysing the European Central Bank, which should be much more active in the current situation. Soros claims that the European project can only now be saved if Germany accepts its leading role, which means, in concrete terms, that it agrees to pay up. Financial support for Greece and other Mediterranean countries is in Germanyâ€™s best interests. If Spain or another large country goes down, German banks are in danger of going down with them: helping Euro partners is much less expensive than putting the pieces of its own ruined banking system back together later on.
