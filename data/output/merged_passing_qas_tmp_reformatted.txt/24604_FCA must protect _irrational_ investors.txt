FCA must protect “irrational” investors


Martin Wheatley, chairman of the new Financial Consumer Authority (FCA), claims in an interview with the Financial Times that the 2008 financial crisis fundamentally changed the population which the regulator is required to protect. It must not assume that investors will make rational choices, meaning that regulators are required to limit or forbid sales of potentially harmful products. The FCA will become an independent entity as part of the dismantling of the Financial Services Authority (FSA).
