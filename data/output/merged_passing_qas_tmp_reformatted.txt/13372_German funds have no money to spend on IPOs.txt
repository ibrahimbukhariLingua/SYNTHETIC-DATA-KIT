German funds have no money to spend on IPOs


According to a survey of 44 fund managers, German asset management firms have become increasingly critical of IPOs, and 90% of them are planning to analyse businesses which turn to the open markets more critically than in the past, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports, adding that foreign institutional investors will pick up the slack.German asset managers recommend to candidates for IPOs that they go on “pre-IPO roadshows,” in order to spread the word to investors. Three quarters of respondents also recommend that businesses get an independent valuation before turning to banks to set up IPOs.Fund managers estimate that the new introductions should total at least EUR150m and 40% float.Four fifths of respondents thing that failures of IPOs in the past can be blamed on an unconvincing equity story. Managers are particularly sceptical of companies launched on the markets by private equity firms.
