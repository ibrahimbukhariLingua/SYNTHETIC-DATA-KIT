AMF warns investors against Global International Trading


The French regulator AMF issued a statement on February 15 drawing the attention of the public to the activities of Global International Trading, a firm headquartered in Japan. The firm operates by telephone, contacting investors largely resident in France, to offer them shares issued by mining companies which it claims have a high potential for growth. The AMF states that the firm is not licensed “either to operate, or to conduct activities as a provider of investment services, or to receive funds, in France.” However, it has already been the subject of a warning from the Dutch counterpart of the AMF, the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). The AMF consequently recommends that investors ignore solicitations from this firm. The AMF has handed over information in its possession about this firm to the Paris prosecutor’s office.
