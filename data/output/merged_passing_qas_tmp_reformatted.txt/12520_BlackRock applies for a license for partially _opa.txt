BlackRock applies for a license for partially “opaque” actively-managed ETFs


BlackRock Fund Advisors, Spruce ETF Trust and BlackRock Investments submitted a joint application to the SEC on 1 September, seeking an exemption from the Investment Company Act of 1940 to be allowed to launch a range of 13 actively-managed ETFs, which would be “non-transparent,” meaning that they would not publish the composition of their portfolio on a daily basis.The range would include the Large Cap Fund, Large Cap Value Fund, Large Cap Growth Fund, Large/Mid Cap Fund, Large/Mid Cap Value Fund, Large/Mid Cap Growth Fund, Large Cap Long-Short Fund, Large Cap Value Long-Short Fund, Large Cap Growth Long-Short Fund, Large/Mid Cap Long-Short Fund, Large/Mid Cap Value Long-Short Fund, Large/Mid Cap Growth Long-Short Fund et Large Cap Growth Active Insights Fund. Indicative intraday value for the funds would be published in real time, but shares would be tradeable at their net asset value only once a day. This formula would avoid significant divergences between the buy and sell prices for the shares and the net asset value.BlackRock claims that the format of the funds would not pose new regulatory problems, but on the contrary, would limit front-running and free-riding risks which other actively-managed ETFs which publish the composition of their portfolios are exposed to.Each of the non-transparent ETFs would invest in or take short positions mainly on the 1,200 largest US caps, as defined by the Frank Russell Company.
