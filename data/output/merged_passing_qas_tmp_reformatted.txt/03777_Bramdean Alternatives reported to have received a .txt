Bramdean Alternatives reported to have received a takeover offer


The Financial Times reports that Vincent Tchanguiz has called an extraordinary general shareholder’s meeting at Bramdean Alternatives. The management firm (USD181.65m in assets as of the end of March) has announced that it has been contacted by a potential buyer. Capitalisation stands at over GBP75m, the Telegraph reports. Bramdean Alternatives is managed by Nicola Horlick, who invested 10% of the firm’s assets in Madoff in late 2008. The major shareholders are Tchanguiz (28.7%), Hampshire Country Council Pension Fund, RMF Investment Management, Merseyside Pension Fund, and Tilney Investment Management. Horlick selected Cenkos Securities as financial advisor to define strategic options which may include a sale of the firm in whole or in parts.
