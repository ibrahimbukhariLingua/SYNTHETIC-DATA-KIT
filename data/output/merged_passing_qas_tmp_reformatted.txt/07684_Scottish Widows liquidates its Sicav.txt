Scottish Widows liquidates its Sicav


On its Luxembourg website, Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP) has announced that the SWIP Sicav and all its sub-funds are in the process of liquidation, and that they will no longer be available for investment. In concrete terms, this means that following the departure of the entire emerging markets team to Martin Currie (see Newsmanagers of 6 May), the Scottish management firm is closing down the last two funds in the Sicav, Emerging Market Smaller Companies and Emerging Market Infrastructure. Following the American Fund, which was wound down in late 2008, five other sub-funds of the Sicav were liquidated in May (Absolute Return Macro, European Real Estate Securities, European Smaller Companies, High Alpha Euro Bond et US Dollar Absolute Return).
