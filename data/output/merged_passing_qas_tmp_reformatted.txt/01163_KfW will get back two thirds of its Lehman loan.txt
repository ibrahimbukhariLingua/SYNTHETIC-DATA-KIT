KfW will get back two thirds of its Lehman loan


According to sources familiar with the matter, the German public bank KfW will recuperate about EUR214m of the EUR320m it mistakenly sent to Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008, at a time when the bankruptcy of the American bank had already become public knowledge, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. This recovery rate of 67% is higher than the rate other lenders will receive, since KfW is entitled to claim a Lehman deposit held with the German federal debt administration office.
