Madoff: Swiss firm UBP prepared to pay up to USD500m


The court-appointed trustee for the Madoff funds, Irving Picard, announced on 6 December that he has signed an agreement with the Swiss bank Union Bancaire Privée (UBP) for a sum of up to USD500m.The settlement, which has yet to be approved by the Manhattan bankruptcy courts, was signed with UBP and an affiliate of UBP based in the Cayman islands, M-Invest, “for at least USD470m in cash, an amount which may total USD500m, depending on the outcome of other ongoing legal actions,” Picard says in a statement. The agreement allows UBP to avoid a USD1bn lawsuit which the trustee was planning.“The amicable agreement with UBP is the first cash agreement with a feeder fund, and the first major international agreement, two major steps in the global recovery effort” to claw back funds lost in the giant fraud orchestrated by Bernard Madoff, Picard comments.In a statement, UBP says that it accepted the agreement in order to protect its clients and to move on. Picard has also accepted UBP’s claims as a victim of the Madoff fraud for a total of USD756m. UBP was named in a class-action lawsuit filed in May 2009 by former clients, accusing it of having stripped their funds and invested them with the fraudster Madoff’s business.
