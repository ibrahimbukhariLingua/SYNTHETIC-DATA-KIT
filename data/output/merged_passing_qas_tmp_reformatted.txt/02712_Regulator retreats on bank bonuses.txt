Regulator retreats on bank bonuses


The Financial Times reports, citing people familiar with the matter, that the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has backed away from specific recommendations on how bankers’ bonuses should be structured in its final remuneration code, due to be unveiled on Wednesday. The regulator still claims that pay scales should be more closely tied to risks. But it will not give specific recommendations about the way in which bonuses should be structured, for fear that it could undermine the UK’s international competitiveness.
