Carlyle to debut on Nasdaq at a lower share price than its initial range


According to the financial TV network CNBC, due to a cautious attitude on the part of investors ahead of an IPO for the private equity firm Carlyle on the Nasdaq stock exchange, the firm is preparing to set a price range for its IPO of USD22 to USD23 per share, down from an initially planned price range of USD23 to UDS25, Les Echos reports. The operation values the firm at USD6.7bn to USD7.5bn, down from an initial objective of USD8bn. The caution of directors is largely due to the poor outcome for its California-based rival Oaktree Capital, which held its IPO in early April and was not able to sell all the shares on offer.
