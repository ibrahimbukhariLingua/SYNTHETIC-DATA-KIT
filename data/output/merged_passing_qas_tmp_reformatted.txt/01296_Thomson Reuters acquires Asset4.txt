Thomson Reuters acquires Asset4


Thomson Reuters has acquired the Swiss firm Asset4 AG, based in Zoug, for an amount which has not been disclosed, but which is thought not to be terribly high due to the presumed financial difficulties of the target firm. Asset4 claims to be one of the world’s leading providers of environmental, social and governance (ESG) data to professional investors and business executives. Thomson Reuters says the transaction marks a further step in its integration of ESG criteria into its mainstream research. Among the existing clients of Asset4 are Banque Sarasin, Storebrand and Société Générale.
