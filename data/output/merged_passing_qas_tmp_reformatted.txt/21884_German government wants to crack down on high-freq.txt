German government wants to crack down on high-frequency trading


Klaus-Peter Flosbach, spokesman for the CDU/CSU alliance in the German parliament, on Tuesday announced that the parties of the government coalition are planning to give the market regulator the power to stop high-frequency trading at any time, without waiting for any potential European regulations on the subject. An initial draft of the bill will be presented in late June, and the first bill may be released this autumn, thus before the German legislative elections in September 2013, Die Welt reports.Flosbach says it is regrettable that so far, firms which practice high-frequency trading are not required to apply for a license, and that the regulator has no resources at its disposal to interrupt trading at any time. In addition, there is not yet a limit on the proportion of orders passed to orders processed.Deutsche BÃ¶rse, however, in February introduced a maximal fine of EUR20,000 for operators who put many more orders into the system than they subsequently execute.
