Madoff trustee sues Abu Dhabi sovereign fund


The trustee representing victims of Bernard Madoff, Irving Picard, has filed a lawsuit against the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (Adia), seeking seeking the return of USD300m that the sovereign wealth fund withdrew from the giant Ponzi scheme, the Financial Times reports. The lawsuit marks the first action by Picard against a sovereign fund, but unlike others, the suit does not allege that Adia knew or should have known that Madoff was a fraud.
