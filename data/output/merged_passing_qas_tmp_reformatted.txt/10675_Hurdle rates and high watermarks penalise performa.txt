Hurdle rates and high watermarks penalise performance


In an empirical study of 3,571 hedge funds over 19 years (January 1990-March 2009), on the basis of the Barclay hedge fund database, three University of texas researchers (GÃ¶kce Soydemir, Jan Smolarski and Sangheon Shin) have drawn the conclusion that funds which rely on hurdle rates and/or high watermarks tend to underperform funds which do not use them. 74.5% of funds which use high watermarks do not offer hurdle rates. Emerging markets funds, equity funds and funds of funds also tend to significantly underperform other types of funds.Funds which charge high performance commissions also tend to outperform funds which charge more moderate commissions.In general, setting a high watermark or hurdle rate appears insufficient to generate higher returns; to contribute to higher returns, the hurdle rate or high watermark strategy needs to be accompanied by a high performance commission, in order to allow the fund to more easily achieve higher risk-adjusted returns.In the figures which accompany the survey, the authors observe that 855, or 24% of hedge funds use a hurdle rate, and 2,974 (83.3%) offer a high watermark to attract investors. Among these, 2,215, or 74.5%, do not use a hurdle rate.In total, 759 funds (21.3%) use both a hurdle rate and a high watermark, while 501 funds (14%) use neither. Lastly, hedge funds which charge a high watermark chage an average of 15.3% performance commissions, which is five times higher than those which do not use one.
