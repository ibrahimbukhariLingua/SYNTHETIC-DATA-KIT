SRI gets a boost from money markets


In 2009, assets in open-ended mutual funds which adhere to a socially responsible investment (SRI) approach on sale in France rose 68%, to a total of nearly EUR34bn, according to the most recent statistics from Novethic. This growth was largely driven by SRI money market funds, whose assets increased by 132.2% over the course of the year to EUR14.6bn, and which now have more assets than equities funds (EUR13.9bn). The number of money market funsd has increased form 16 to 23, out of a total of 268, though these funds were largely created through conversions of existing funds. In total, conversions of traditional products into SRI funds represented EUR8.6bn in 2009, meaning that they accounted for most of the increase in assets, though subscriptions totalled EUR2.2bn. The remainder of asset growth (EUR3bn) is due to positive market effects. Novethic notes that “best in class” type selection remains the norm in France, though there is now increased interest in thematic and normative exclusionary approaches.
