oekom research to advise charities


The Munich-based SRI ratings agency oekom research on Tuesday announced that it has signed a cooperation agreement which will come into force on 1 April, with the German charities association (Bundesverbandes Deutscher Stiftungen). By the terms of the agreement, oekom research will offer more than 3,400 charities which belong to the association one-shot custom sustainable diagnostics on their portfolios, free of charge. This will allow the investors to avoid pitfalls such as the controversy in the Netherlands which was triggered when an anti-cancer charity, KWF Kankerbestrijding, was found to have invested part of its assets in the tobacco sector. Speaking to Newsmanagers, Rolf Häßler, head of products and development at oekom research, says that the agency may later earn commissions if the charities consider it useful to undertake ongoing screenings of their portfolios, or if they decide to invest in SRI funds which rely on research from oekom research.
