Normative exclusion and shareholder engagement should go hand in hand, says Novethic


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Normative exclusion, which for investors consists of excluding businesses wich are guilty of severe and repeated violations of major international conventions, particularly by blacklisted businesses, is not enough to change things by itself, Novethic says in a new study on the influence that responsible investors can achieve (“Controversial establishments: to investor blacklists alter the playing field?” “Entreprises controversées : les listes noires d’investisseurs changent-elles la donne?”) “But the impact of normative exclusion could be multiplied by coordinated shareholder actions, relayed by public opinion and the media,” the agency dedicated to responsible investment adds. It finds that “combining shareholder engagement and normative exclusion are an effective form of responsible investment,” but that it is far from being widespread in Europe. Novethic observes that investors are increasingly raising questions about the risks that an economic model designed to the detriment of local populations and employees may carry. But between the moment when these questions are raised and when action is taken, there is a long time. “The challenge for responsible investors, then, is to develop models that allow them to identify controversies as they develop in order to avoid beng accused of complicity in them later,” the agency claims.
