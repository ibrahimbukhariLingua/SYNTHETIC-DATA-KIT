Call to regulate Swiss independent managers


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Clients of Swiss banks which refuse to bring themselves into compliance with new tax sharing rules could turn to independent managers, the chairman of the board of directors of Julius Baer, Raymond Baer, admits in an interview with Le Temps published on 19 March, Agefi Switzerland reports. “We are planning to address such cases,” the banker admits. “The fact that they can turn to independent managers is a concern which we have as a depository bank.” Independent managers represent “an important sector which doesn’t have the same rules as banks,” Baer adds. But “the reputation of the financial market needs to be defended. Hence the need to regulate it.”
