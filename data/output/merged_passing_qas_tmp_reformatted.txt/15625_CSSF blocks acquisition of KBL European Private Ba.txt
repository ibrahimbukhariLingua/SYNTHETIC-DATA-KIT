p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } On 15 March, a spokesman for the Luxembourg Financial Sector Surveillance Commission (CSSF) declined to comment “concretely,” but confirmed a statement published earlier that day by the KBC group announcing that the planned sale of KBL European Private Bankers (KBL epb), active in ten European countries, for EUR1.35bn, to the Indian Hinduja group, “will not take place.”The Belgian firm states that the CSSF on 14 March confirmed “its decision not to pursue evaluation of acquisition of KBL epb by the Hinduja group,” as the regulator arrived “at the conclusion that its decision would be to oppose” the deal. KBC adds that “the CSSF drew this conclusion in light of the application of criteria set out in the financial sector law and after consultation with other competent authorities.” Assets at KBL epb (2,522 employees, 418 of whom are private bankers) as of the end of December totalled EUR47bn.
