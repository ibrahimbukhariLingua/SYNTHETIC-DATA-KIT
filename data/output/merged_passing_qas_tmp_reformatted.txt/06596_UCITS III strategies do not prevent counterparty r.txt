UCITS III strategies do not prevent counterparty risks


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The managing director of Meteor Asset Management, Graham Devile, says plans in the structured products sector to do away with counterparty risk by using the UCITS III format will certainly not resolve all problems, Money Marketing reports. The UCITS III former is too costly to be viable, and Devile does not think that it is a panacea to resolve the problem of counterparty risks. UCITS III funds need to have at least GBP10m in assets under management to be profitable. Structured products are offered for set periods, and rarely attain these levels. “Management of such a vehicle can cost GBP100,000 per year,” says Devile.
