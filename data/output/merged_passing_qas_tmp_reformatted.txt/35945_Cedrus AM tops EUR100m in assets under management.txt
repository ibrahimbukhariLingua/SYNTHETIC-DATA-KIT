Cedrus AM tops EUR100m in assets under management


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } The asset management firm Cedrus AM, which has been in existence for 18 months, has topped EUR100m in assets under management in four OPCVM funds, the firm announced on 5 September in a statement. Assets advised in funds of funds, for their part, represent EUR300m. Clients of Cedrus AM currently come from the institutional world. The increasingly marked attraction for IFAs of using the resources of an asset management firm will in the near future allow Cedrus AM to undertake diversification in the area of distribution. This development confirms that sustainable and responsible thematic investments may sustain lively interest from investors, particularly when the approach is focused particularly on generating returns. This dynamic accelerated with the launch of the Megatrends equity fund, which now has over EUR50m in assets. This strategy makes it possible to invest in an unfrozen manner in three themes: energy transition, management of resources, and health issues. Via a diversified portfolio and a sustainable vision of investments, the management of the fund meets the fundamental challenges which our civilization will need to confront in the next few decades.
