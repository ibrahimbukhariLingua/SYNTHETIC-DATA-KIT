Swiss private banking: a quality export


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Agefi Switzerland reports that an independent recruitment specialist in Geneva for banking professionals, Astrid Bek & Associates, will open an affiliate in Singapore this November. According to Astrid Bek, there are real opportunities to export private banking to Asia, Brazil and the Middle East. Major Asian investors, both private and sovereign, are seeking to structure their investments, and Singapore is becoming the new global centre for private banking, a role that Switzerland once occupied. The wealth management model of Asian banks is in transition between mass-affluent and private banking, where Swiss expertise is highly valued.
