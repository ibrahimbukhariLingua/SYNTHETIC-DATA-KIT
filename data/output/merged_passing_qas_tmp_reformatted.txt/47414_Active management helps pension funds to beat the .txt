Active management helps pension funds to beat the market


Thanks to active management, pension funds have managed to outperform the market, a study by CEM Benchmarking performed between 1992 and 2013 covering more than 1,000 private and public pension funds has shown. But this outperformance is limited to 16 basis points after costs.The survey reveals that pension funds earned higher reutrns than the index by about 58 basis points. But investment costs absorb nearly 75% of this gain. For CEM Benchmarking, that illustrates why funds need to measure and manage their costs.The study shows that three characteristics improve the performance of a fund compared with the index. The first is active management. On average, actively-managed assets added 38.7 basis points of net added value compared with passively-managed assets. Secondly, in-house management outperforms external management, with an average difference of 22.1 basis points. Lastly, large funds perform better than others: for each increase in fund size of an order of 10, funds save 7.6 basis points through reduced costs.
