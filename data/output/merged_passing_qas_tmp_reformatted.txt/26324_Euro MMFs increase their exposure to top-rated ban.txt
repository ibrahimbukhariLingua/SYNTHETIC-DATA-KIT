Euro MMFs increase their exposure to top-rated banks and quasi-sovereigns


In third quarter 2013, euro money market funds shows higher allocation towards top-held ‘F1+' banks and quasi-sovereigns, amid a portfolio rating mix dominated by ‘F1' issuers, and a lengthening of portfolios’ average maturity to compensate for low yields, according to Fitch Ratings’ 3Q13 quarterly report. Fitch-rated European MMFs denominated in euros have on average about half of their portfolio assets concentrated in 20 entities, led by Rabobank (AA/F1+) and other highly rated banks, such as Nordea Bank, HSBC, Svenska Handelsbanken, or Standard Chartered Bank (all rated AA-/F1+).. ‘F1'-rated banks, such as Barclays, BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole, saw the biggest fall in fund allocation over the past year, although they remain among the top held names, notably as repurchase agreement counterparties. Yet, the average portfolio rating mix is now showing a predominance of investments rated ‘F1', or equivalent, at 54% of portfolios on average, up from 35% until June this year. This is due to the downgrade of France’s Long-term Issuer Default Rating to ‘AA+' in July, followed by the downgrade of the most widely held French banks to ‘F1' from ‘F1+'.
