Efama in favour of simplified prospectus


In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Jean-Baptiste de Franssu, chairman of Efama and head of Invesco Europe, states that Efama supports the idea of simplified prospectuses for financial products, but insists that the measure should apply to all investment products in a comparable form: in practice, funds are already much more transparent than other types of financial vehicle, such as life insurance and certificates. Similar to the way it is done for medicines, a label should list the specific properties and risks, says de Franssu, much as Ilse Agnier, German federal minister of consumer protection, has been suggesting. Thus far, only ING Diba and Deutsche Bank have made concrete changes of this kind. De Franssu has also announced that he is planning an EFAMA initiative during his term to support a European long-term savings plan on the model of the Riester policies which now exist in Germany. This type of product already exists in several European countries, but the mobility of the workforce within the EU has been held back by the fact that national retirement systems are not co-ordinated and have significant differences. Therefore, a riester retirement system for all of Europe is required.
