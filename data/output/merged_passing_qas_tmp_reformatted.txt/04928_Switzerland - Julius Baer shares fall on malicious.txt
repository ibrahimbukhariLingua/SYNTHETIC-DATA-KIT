Switzerland - Julius Baer shares fall on malicious rumours


In Friday trading, shares in Julius Baer had at times lost more than 30% in what may have been a case of market price manipulation, on rumours that the bank had presented doctored results for 2008 that morning, the Börsen-Zeitung reports. It turns out that losses of owners’ equity at the bank described in an anonymous letter in late December were limited to several million Swiss francs, and had been taken into account. KPMG has certified the accounts.
