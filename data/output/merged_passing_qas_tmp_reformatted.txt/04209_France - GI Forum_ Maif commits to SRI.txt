France - GI Forum: Maif commits to SRI


?This year, we wil set up a socially responsible investment practice,? said Pierre Bougeard, director of financial management at Maif, in a session at the GI Forum dedicated to SRI. ?There will be a charter distributed to all employees to inform them, and we will also inform our members,? he says. Maif previously established a plan to place 15% of its investments in equities OPCVM funds with SRI management, which has now been achieved. The plan now is to introduce SRI management in other asset classes, particularly bonds.Bougeard says that for SRI, there is now a ?plethora? of product offerings, and, he says, these investments are defined ?not in terms of a product range which an institutional investor can choose from, but the criteria? of the investor itself.
