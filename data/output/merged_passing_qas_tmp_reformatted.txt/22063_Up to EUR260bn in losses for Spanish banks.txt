Up to EUR260bn in losses for Spanish banks


Losses at Spanish banks may total EUR260bn, and the sector may need a bailout of up to EUR60bn, according to the international institute of finance (IIF). In the basis of calculations comparing them with Irish banks, which also had to confront a collapse of a speculative bubble in the real estate market, economists at the Washington-based banking organisation estimated the losses at Spanish banks at EUR218bn to EUR260bn in 2012-2013. “A number of factors suggest that losses may be at the high end of the range. Macroeconomic outlooks in Spain are worse than those Ireland faced, particularly in terms of growth and unemployment,” they say in a note on the global economy published on 21 May. “The heaviest losses will be generated by real estate mortgages, which are concentrated at the Cajas,” the regional savings banks, they added.
