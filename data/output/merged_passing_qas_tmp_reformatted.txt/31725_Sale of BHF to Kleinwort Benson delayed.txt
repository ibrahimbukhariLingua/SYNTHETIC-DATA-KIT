Sale of BHF to Kleinwort Benson delayed


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } Handelsblatt reports that the sale of BHF-Bank by Deutsche Bank to RHJ International (Kleinwort Benson), concluded in September 2012, has still not received approval from BaFin. This is due to the fact that the German regulator has yet to review the financials not onfly for the Kleinwort Benson group alone, but also for the buyers associated with the deal, BlackRock, the billionaire Stefan Quandt and the Chinese conglomerate Fosun. BaFin has confirmed that it is not yet in possession of all the required documents. However, permission is expected in April or May.
