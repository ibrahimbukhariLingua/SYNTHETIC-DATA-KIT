Morocco creates a sovereign fund dedicated to tourism industry


The Moroccan tourism development fund (FMDT), which is supported by capital from the nationâ€™s government as well as the private sector, has been created in order to propel the country along on its Vision 2020 initiative to double the number of visitors to the country, Agefi Switzerland reports. The FMDT will have initial capital of MAD1.5bn (EUR130m), which will be increased to MAD10bn over ten years.
