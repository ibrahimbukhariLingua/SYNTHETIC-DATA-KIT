Julius Baer makes changes to Italian management


Julius Baer SIM has made a number of changes to its executive management in Italy. The board of directors nominated Gian Paolo Bardelli as new CEO of Julius Baer SIM S.p.A., and Giovanni Flury, member of the executive board of Julius Baer, as new vice-chairman of the board of directors of Julius Baer SIM. Since 2006, Gian Paolo Bardelli has been in charge of international Private Banking at Julius Baer in Singapore, where he was also a member of the executive board Asia. He has spent his entire career abroad; while at UBS he worked in Zurich, Geneva and London prior to managing the BDL Banco di Lugano subsidiary in Singapore. Stefano Canossa, the outgoing CEO, is returning to Zurich to assume an important position in development projects, according to a press release. These appointments will contribute to the expansion of Julius Baer in the strategically important Italian market. The Swiss bank aims to expand its client network by increasing its size and geographical spread.
