Aviva Investors redeploys staff


Following the announcement of a reorientation of its business to serve mainly institutional clients (see Newsmanagers of 1 February), Aviva Investors has announced that it has made some refinements in the area of distribution of duties. Active equities management will be moved to three locations, serving four regions: Asia and emerging markets in Singapore, European equities in Paris, and British equities in London. This is evidently on condition that clients support these changes.As the SRI desk in London will be closed, a global team will need to be established, which will handle socially responsible investment for all products of the range.Money Marketing reports that the SRI team, which has about GBP1.1bn in assets under management, is hoping to be sold off to a competitor.
