La Banque Postale launches a fintech incubator


La Banque Postale has launched platform58, a fintech and insurance tech startup incubator, which from 1 February 2018, will assist startups in the seed capital phase, without acquiring a stake, at a 3,200 square metre location in the 9th district of Paris, at 58, rue de la Victoire. In addition to platform58, the building will be home to the headquarters of Ma French Bank, a coding school entitled Simplon, and a shared office area. The incubator will assist and host young startups developing solutions in the fields of banking, insurance, technologies, and services associated with finance, such as data management, health care, and education. “The banking and insurance sector is at a turning point in its existence. The aspirations of our clients, as well as our employees, technological developments, and the arrival of new players make it necessary to design a more open, platform type model in banking and insurance. Our ambition with platform58, a strategic project for La Banque Postale, is to anticipate changes by creating a French fintech and insurance tech ecosystem which respects our values in banking as citizens, so that we can together, as startups, partners, etc., construct the banking and insurance industry of tomorrow,” says Rémy Weber, chairman of the board at La Banque Postale. The platform58 incubator will offer selected startups (up to 10 per year) bespoke assistance provided by experts and directors at La Banque Postale. Other participants, including CNP Assurances, 50 Partners1, Visa, EY, TelecomParisTech 1000Mercis, and Startway will contribute to help the incubated startups succeed. The startups will be selected by a committee created from teams at platform58 in the entrepreneurial and startup industries, and from partners in various fields, including affiliates of La Banque Postale (KissKissBankBank, Goodeed, Ma French Bank, LBPAM, etc.).
