Pension funds: Aon Hewitt wants more transparency and legal stability


Legislation and fear of more restrictive standards to come are obstructing the creation of European pension funds, according to a study undertaken by Aon Hewitt in December 2011, covering 60 major businesses operating in Europe, with over 2 million employees. In response to a question about the pertinence of cross-border pension funds, 76% of businesses participating in the study say that they support entities of this type. However, the three major factors which are preventing employers from putting in place cross-border pension funds are perceived cmolpexity of legislation (66%), a lack of clarity about the way in which European legislation is enacted and regulated nationally (48%) and the perceived weight of national regulatory requirements (40%). Another one third of respondents were hesitant to use the Single Brand framework to create additional costs which future regulatory changes may give rise to. The consulting firm, which has recently responded to the second consultation by EIOPA (the European authority for professional insurance and complementary retirement) on revisions to the European IORP directive, opposed the legislative changes, which may increase costs for employers rather than increasing adoption of complementary professional retirement schemes. Kevin Wesbroom, director of the Retirement Risk Mangement department at Aon Hewitt, says that “given the material implications of potential changes described in the EIOPA consultation document, we are concerned at this stage about the lack of a profound cost/benefit analysis of the impact of the changes. The blindfolded transposition of the Solvency II regime planned for the insurance industry will damage availability of professional complementary retirement, and will complicate their management.” René van Leggelo, an expert in international mobility and European pension funds at Aon Hewitt France, concludes that “for the past 18 months, I have seen a growing interest in the French market for optimisation of complementary retirement plans. Some CAC 40 businesses are currently in a feasibility study phase considering potential combinations of their European plans in a single vehicle such as a IORP.”
