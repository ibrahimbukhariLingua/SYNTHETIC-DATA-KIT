Swiss Life Asset Managers posts over EUR2bn in inflows in first half


Swiss Life Asset Managers, launched in November 2012 to unite all expertise of the Swiss Life group in asset management for third parties, has postd inflows of CHF2.528trn, or EUR2.054trn, largely from expertise acquired and reinforced since the launch of the real estate, fixed incoe, money market and diversified fund ranges. In France, Swiss Life AM has posted inflows of over EUR700m to money market funds, at a time when this market segment shows strong outflows. “This historic expertise in the area of money market management and the performance of funds has allowed for 16 new institutional clients to be conquered and made loyal on the French market since the beginning of the year,” Swiss Life says in a statement. Swiss Life Asset Managers, which in May oversaw the opening of a representative office in French-speaking Switzerland, in Geneva, dedicated exclusively to distribution, is next year planning to scale up its presence in Germany, the United Kingdom and Scandinavia.
