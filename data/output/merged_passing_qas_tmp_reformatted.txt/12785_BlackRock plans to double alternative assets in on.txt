BlackRock plans to double alternative assets in one year


In an interview with Handelsblatt, Rob Kapito, one of the co-founders of BlackRock, has stated that the US management firm is planning to double its volume of alternative assets under management in one year (particularly in private equity and hedge funds), from a current total of USD113bn. Private equity funds will aim for a target of USD500m. Kapito has also announced that the internal trading platform under development at BlackRock will be ready in one year. It will be used for all types of securities, but BlackRock has no plans to make a profit on the activity.
