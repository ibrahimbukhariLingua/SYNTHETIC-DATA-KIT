Merrill Lynch bonuses: Judge accuses SEC of complacency


After accusing Bank of America directors of lying to their shareholders about USD3.6bn in bonuses awarded to Merrill Lynch executives, Judge Rakoff has now accused the SEC of complacency. The District Court of Manhattan judge has challenged the “amicable settlement” reached between the SEC and BoA, by which the bank paid a fine of USD33m. Rakoff argues that a more severe sanction needs to be imposed on the directors responsible rather than on shareholders.
