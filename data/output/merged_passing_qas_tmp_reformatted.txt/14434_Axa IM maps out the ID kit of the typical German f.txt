Axa IM maps out the ID kit of the typical German fund subscriber


On the basis of a TNS Infratest telephone survey of a representative sample of 1,000 people on behalf of Axa Investment Managers Deutschland, the typical subscriber to a German investment fund has been found to be a man, who lives in the western part of the country, uses the internet, and has an average income (EUR1,500 to EUR3,000 per month).The study has also found that 95% of shareholders in investment funds consider advising highly important. For this they turn to advisers at banks or insurance companies, or to financial advisers. Their choice of fund goes to a provider with a good reputation.
