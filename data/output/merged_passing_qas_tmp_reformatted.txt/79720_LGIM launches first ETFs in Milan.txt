LGIM launches first ETFs in Milan


Legal & General Investment Management, the second-largest asset management firm in Europe, with USD1.3trn in assets, is launching a range of five low-cost core equity ETFs in Italy, Bluerating reports. The British firm is currently deploying an ambitious plan across Europe, which includes Germany, Spain and Switzerland, in addition to Italy. In Italy, LGIM is targeting institutional investors, as well as retail and wholesale clients. For this purpose, the company has opened a Milan office, located in via Visconti di Modrone, and appointed Giancarlo Sandrin, formerly of BlackRock, as head for Italy for wholesale and retail markets. At a press conference in Milan, Sandrin commented that “Italy is the European market whose growth has been the fastest in the ETF sector, and the annual growth rate for assets in the sector is nearly twice the rate for other markets in the region.” “The launch of our retail activity in Italy is a fundamental step in our long-term expansion plan in Europe,” says Honor Solomon, head of retail for EMEA at Legal & General IM, cited by Bluerating.
