Investors steeply cut back exposure to equities


After a hesitation of several weeks, investors have finally chosen to reduce their exposure to equities by significant proportions in recent days. This sudden aversion to risk has clearly been driven by persistent commercial tensions and rising turbulence in emerging markets. In the week ending 12 September, funds dedicated to equities saw net outflows of USD5.6bn, the largest outflows of the past 11 weeks, according to the weekly Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey, based on data from the global flow monitoring specialist EPFR Global.With the notable exception of funds specialised in Japan, which attracted USD0.9bn in the past week, all other categories of funds finished the week more or less in negative territory. European equity funds, which had seen a timid return to positive territory last week, after 25 weeks of outflows, finished the week in negative territory again, with net outflows of USD1.4bn. In the past six months, European equity funds have seen outflows of USD57bn.
