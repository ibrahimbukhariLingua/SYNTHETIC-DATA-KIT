ERAFP waiting for a positive change in asset allocation regulatory framework


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Philippe Desfossés, CEO of France’s Etablissement de retraite additionnelle pour la fonction publique (ERAFP), is impatiently awaiting the publication of a decree which is expected to alter the regulatory framework for asset allocation in the young pension fund. This is expected to liberate it from a regulatory situation in which it is still required to invest 65% of its portfolio in bonds (largely euro zone government bonds). It is becoming difficult to invest so much in bonds, whose returns have bever been lower. Bonds, which represent 72% of the portfolio, have never been so expensive, with OATs at 1.3%, and Bunds at 0.8%. Desfossés, interviewed by Newsmanagers TV, discussed another constraint the ERAFP is subject to: it has no way to invest even a limited percentage of its assets in open-ended funds. The institution relies on requests for proposals whose procedures may last a total of 9 months to one year. This causes a clear lack of flexibility, the director says, and calls for more responsiveness.
