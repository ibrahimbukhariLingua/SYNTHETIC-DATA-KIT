Knight Vinke rejects Glencore takeover bid for Xstrata


The activist fund Knight Vinke, a shareholder in the commodity giant Xstrata, on 9 September announced that it is rejecting an increased bid by Glencore to merge the businesses. The investor has called on Xstrata to “seek the highest price possible.” Glencore, facing a failure of its bid, on Friday raised its bid for Xstrata, which now stands at USD37bn. Glencore has raised its proposed trade ratio to 3.05 shares in Glencore for each share in Xstrata, from 2.8 shares previously. The Glencore bid also specifies that its CEO, Ivan Glasenberg, would become head of the new firm. “Glencore’s most recent proposal clearly states that the transaction implies a change of control, which, we continue to claim, should imply the consequent payment of a premium,” Knight Vinke says in a statement. For its part, Xstrata on Friday claimed that the improved bid was “significantly lower than what might be expected for such a takeover.” Its heads have sent a letter to Glencore asking for “clarification” of the bid.
