Hedge funds betting that markets will fall further


The International Strategy & Investment Group index, which measures the positions held by 35 hedge funds with assets under management of about USD84bn, on 16 August fell to 45.8, compared with a 2011 high of 54.2 in February, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. This means, concretely, that short positions have reached their highest level in two years, and that hedge funds worldwide are expecting the stock markets to continue to fall.
