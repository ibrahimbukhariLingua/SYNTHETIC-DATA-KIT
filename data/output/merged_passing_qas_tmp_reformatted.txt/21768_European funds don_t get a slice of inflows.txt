European funds don’t get a slice of inflows


European funds, including both short-term and long-term funds, in second quarter 2012 began to show net inflows, according to the most recent statistics compiled by Morningstar. In April, investors placed more than EUR14bn in money market funds, and only EUR4.3bn in long-term funds. Bond funds continue to be the most sought-after asset class, particularly private loan funds and non-European debt funds. The trend is similar for equity funds, as the Morningstar euro zone large caps category has seen a 14th consecutive month of net outflows in April, totalling EUR900m.“Despite particularly erratic markets, inflows remain positive for funds domiciled in Europe at the beginning of second quarter. However, the funds which are attracting money are mostly invested outside Europe, both in equities and bonds,” says Dan Lefkovitz, in the European research team.
