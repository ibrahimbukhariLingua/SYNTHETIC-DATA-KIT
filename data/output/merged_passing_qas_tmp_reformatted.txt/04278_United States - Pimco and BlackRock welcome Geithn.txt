United States - Pimco and BlackRock welcome Geithner plan


On Wall Street, shares in management firms gained ground after the announcement of the Geithner toxic asset buyback program, from which these firms would be the primary beneficiaries. Two management firms specialised in bonds, Pimco (Allianz group) and BlackRock, have already announced that they will participate in the plan, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. Bill Gross, one of the heads of strategy at Pimco, says this is the first political initiative to remedy the crisis which will benefit all parties concerned. Laurence Fink, CEO of BlackRock, states that although the Geithner plan is not a panacea, it will at least have the positive effect of removing some excess supply from the market.
