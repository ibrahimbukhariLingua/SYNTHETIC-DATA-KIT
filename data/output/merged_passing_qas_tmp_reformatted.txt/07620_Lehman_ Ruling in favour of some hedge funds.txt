Lehman: Ruling in favour of some hedge funds


A U.K. Court of Appeal has ruled in favor of hedge funds which maintained that their client money, held in the main European arm of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., wasnâ€™t properly protected when the investment bank collapsed, the Wall Street Journal writes. The European arm had segregated a pool of as much as about USD2.1 billion of money for some hedge-fund clients, thus providing protection in the event of bankruptcy. But the bank failed to ring-fence potentially billions of dollars of additional money for other clients who also believed their money was segregated. The ruling is likely to disappoint hedge funds whose money had been properly segregated and which now will have to share the USD2.1 billion with others, says the WSJ.
