Madoff: Mary Schapiro responds to Republican accusations


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mary Schapiro, announced to lawmakers that she will be reexamining the agencyâ€™s conflict of interest practices, the Wall Street Journal reports. The announcement comes as a response to controversy triggered by Republican representatives over the way in which she managed the former legal director of the SEC, David Becker, whose mother had invested with Bernard Madoff, and who resigned last month. Becker and his brother are asked by the court-appointed trustee, Irving Picard, to repay USD1.5m of the USD2m they inherited from their mother. Schapiro will be expecting particularly tough questions in two congressional hearings on Thursday.
