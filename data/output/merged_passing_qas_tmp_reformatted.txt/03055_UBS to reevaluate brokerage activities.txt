UBS to reevaluate brokerage activities


Oswald Grübel, CEO of the Swiss banking giant UBS, has decided not to sell the firm’s brokerage and wealth management activities in the United States, which consist primarily of its affiliate Paine Webber, the American brokerage and wealth management firm acquired barely eight years ago for about USD10.8bn. To stimulate its brokerage activities, UBS is seeking a new head for US activities, the Financial Times reports.
