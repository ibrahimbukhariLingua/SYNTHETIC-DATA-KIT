MSCI offers liquidity risk measurement tool


MSCI announced on September 16 the launch of LiquidityMetrics, a tool for measuring liquidity risk across asset classes, delivered through RiskMetrics RiskManager. Through its methodology, LiquidityMetrics provides a description of asset liquidity and extends liquidity risk to incorporate the time, cost, and size dimensions. This translates into a single liquidity framework that can be used by clients across their organization to support their investment management, risk management and regulatory risk reporting requirements. LiquidityMetrics enables users to stress test the liquidity of a portfolio, measure market impact, transaction cost, liquidation horizon, amount available for liquidation and the liquidation value.
