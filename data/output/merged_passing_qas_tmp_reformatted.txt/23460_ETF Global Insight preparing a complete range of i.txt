ETF Global Insight preparing a complete range of information


The new consulting and research firm ETF Global Insight is soon to release a full range of data on the “exchange traded exposures” segment, Deborah Fuhr has told Newsmanagers.The former head of ETF research from BlackRock says the market needs an independent body in a position not only to gather information about assets and flows worldwide, but also to estimate earnings for all players in the segment, including asset managers, brokers, and index providers. The firm’s ambition is also to cover all firms which use ETFs, by region and type (pension funds, hedge funds and others).Fuhr and her two partners, Shane Kelly and Matthew Murray, are hoping to present a complete panorama of “exchange traded exposures,” which would include all products, including funds (ETF) as well as ETC and ETN products, “partnerships,” and other exchange-traded vehicles (ETV). All of these would be available on the firm’s website.In addition to monthly reports on the markets concerned, ETF Global Insight will publish special thematic reports, and may take on projects and studies for organisations or clients.
