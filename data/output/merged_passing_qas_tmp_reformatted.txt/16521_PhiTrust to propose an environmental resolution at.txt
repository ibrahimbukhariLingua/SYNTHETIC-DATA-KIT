PhiTrust to propose an environmental resolution at Total shareholders’ meeting


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The French asset management firm PhiTrust Active Investors, a specialist in shareholder engagement, would like to propose an environmental resolution with the support of other shareholders at the general shareholders’ meeting for Total on 13 May 2011. The move would be in partnership with Greenpeace France and the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental defence organisation based in the United States. The resolution would ask the French oil company to publish more information on the environmental and social risks connected with its plans to exploit oil tar sands in Canada and their long-term financial impact. According to a Novethic report on shareholder engagement, this would be the first environmental shareholder resolution in France. The PhiTrust initiative echoes the campaign “Tar sands: counting the costs,” which was led by the British NGO FairPensions in 2010, and which brought two resolutions asking Shell and BP to publish data on the environmental, social and financial risks related to their plans to exploit Canadian tar sands.
