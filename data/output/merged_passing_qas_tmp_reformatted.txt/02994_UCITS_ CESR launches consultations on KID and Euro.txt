UCITS: CESR launches consultations on KID and European passport


The Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) on 8 July launched two consultations on the subject of new UCITS directives. This includes a new informational document format, the KID (Key Information Document), which will replace the simplified prospectus. The CESR proposed that the KID should describe the objectives and investment policies of each UCITS product in simple terms, without necessarily providing the description of a full prospectus. The Committee also recommends that a declaration be included which states that investors may redeem their shares on demand, as a survey of consumers by the Commission has found that many investors are not aware of this essential characteristic of UCITS funds. The CESR also states that, in the chapter on cost-benefit analysis, it will prefer an indicator which would include a range of factors, whose methodology has yet to be defined. The CESR has also launched a consultation on the regulatory framework for the UCITS passport, in maximal alignment with the MiFID directive. The two consultations will run until 4 September. The CESR will then present its proposals by the end of October.
