Retail demand bounces back


Bosera announced on Wednesday morning that its Bosera New Growth Equity Fund has raised CNY3.42bn in 15 days, with over 100,000 client accounts. The results appear to Z-Ben Advisors to be a sign that Chinese retail investor demand is recovering. Without prejudice to the virtues ot Bosera as a management firm, more reputable and higher-performing management firms have seen lower levels of subscriptions recently, including Morgan Stanley Huaxin, which raised CNY2.26bn for 27,000 accounts, and China Post & Capital, which raised CNY2.23bn for 90,000 accounts.
