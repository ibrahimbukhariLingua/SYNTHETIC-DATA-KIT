EU takes France to court over mutual fund taxation


The European Commission will announce on Thursday, 19 May, that it is bringing a case before the European Court of Justice to require France to respect the principle that the same tax rules should apply to all investment funds, whether they are based in France or other European countries, Les Echos reports. The EC is of the opinion that the French tax system is currently discriminatory, as it taxes foreign Sicav funds on dividends they are paid by French businesses they invest in, while French OPCVM funds are exempt from taxes on the same type of revenue. This is not in keeping with the principle of free circulation of capital in the Union, the European commissioner for taxation, Algirdas Semeta, claimed in a warning letter to France on 18 March 2010.
