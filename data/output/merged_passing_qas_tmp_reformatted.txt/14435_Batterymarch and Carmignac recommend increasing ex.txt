Batterymarch and Carmignac recommend increasing exposure to emerging markets


Claudio Brocado, a manager at Batterymarch, an affiliate of Legg Mason, estimates that now is the time for investors already exposed to emerging markets to increase their allocation and to take advantage of any downward fluctuations on the markets to increase their positions. At least 13-14% of a portfolio should be invested in emerging markets, but 15% to 20% would be even better, Cinco DÃ­as reports.Brocado is not the only one recommending increasing exposure to emerging markets: Simon Pickard, at Carmignac Gestion, thinks that recent decreases on the markets will not last more than three to six months more. The fact that stock markets in emerging countries saw net outflows of USD25bn in first quarter is a positive factor, because excessive inflows of capital were one of the factors creating inflationary pressure.
