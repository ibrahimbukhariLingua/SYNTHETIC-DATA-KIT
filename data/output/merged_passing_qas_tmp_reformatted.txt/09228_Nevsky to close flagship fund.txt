Nevsky to close flagship fund


Nevsky Capital, the London hedge fund manager, is poised to wind down its flagship emerging markets fund. Sources close to the fund have told the Financial Times that the USD3.3bn Nevsky hedge fund would “highly likely” be liquidated after the departure of its two star managers, Martin Taylor and Nick Barnes, was announced on Wednesday. The pair will continue to manage the fund for another 12 months.
