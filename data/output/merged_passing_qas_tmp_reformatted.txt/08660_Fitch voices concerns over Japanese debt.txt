Fitch voices concerns over Japanese debt


La Tribune reports that the ratings agency Fitch on Thursday, 22 April stated that the solvency of Japan is “in danger” due to an explosion in public borrowing by the country, which has topped 200% of GNP. “In the absence of a sustainable economic recovery and budgetary austerity, public debt will continue to increase, which will lead to a credit rating downgrade in the mid-term,” the agency warned, cited by the newspaper.
