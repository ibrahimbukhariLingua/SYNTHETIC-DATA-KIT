RFPs: not enough attention is paid to evaluation of indices


In an interview with Les Echos, Noël Amenc, professor of finance and director of the Edhec Risk Institute, argues that “the evaluation of indices is too often neglected in RFPs in favour of the choice of managers. This is an error in appreciation, in my understanding, on the part not only of asset management firms, but primarily of investors and their advisers. It must be said that researchers are not exempt from responsibility in this. By confusing the market portfolio in portfolio theory which would be unbeatable on the long term with “weighted-cap” indices [indices which are weighted on the basis of market capitalisation -ed], they have helped to create a condition particular to this method of index construction which nothing currently validates, either empirically or theoretically.”
