Philip Hall and François-Xavier Delorme launch Correl Invest


The French asset management market is gaining a new player. Philip Hall, founder of Axiom Alternative Investments (Axiom AI) in 2006, and François-Xavier Delorme, former head of commercial development for alternative management at Oddo Asset Management, have created Correl Invest. The asset management firm officially obtained a license from the AMF on 20 October 2017. “I created Axiom AI before being joined by five other partners to orient the development of the company toward management of hybrid bank and insurance debt,” Hall explains to NewsManagers. “But meanwhile, I always wanted to develop a multi-strategy fund, combining credit management, long/short equity strategies, and bond strategies. That is why the Premium Multi Stratégies fund was modified in May 2016. But this offering did not fully integrate with the range from Axiom AI, so I decided to go independent.” In September 2017, Hall therefore quit Axiom AI to launch Correl Invest in partnership with Delorme, head of commercial development for the startup asset management firm, and Rémi Dhoyer, quantitative manager, whose mission is to develop systematic models for long/short equity. “Delorme also wanted to develop his sales talent and so we decided to create Correl Invest together,” says Hall. The creation of the company is accompanied by the transfer of the Premium Multi Stratégies fund. “This fund, which has a total of EUR18m in assets under management, aims to generate alpha through multi-strategy allocation,” says Hall. “But it is also a wealth management fund. So we want to develop to serve independent financial advisers, wealth managers, family offices and private clients in the broader sense.” At this stage, Hall and Delorme are planning to focus their efforts to “get the company in place and develop the fund,” says Hall. “We have other plans, but those are not yet current,” the director concludes.
