J.P. Morgan AM unveils its first three active ETFs


The US asset management firm J.P. Morgan Asset Management (J.P. Morgan AM) has announced the launch of three fully transparent, actively managed ETFs as of 16 October. The three new funds will be listed on the London stock exchange, Deutsche Boerse Xetra, and Borsa Italiana, the Italian stock exchange. The three ETFs are: PM Europe Research Enhanced Index Equity (ESG) Ucits ETF, JPM US Research Enhanced Index Equity (ESG) Ucits ETF, and JPM Global Research Enhanced Index Equity (ESG) Ucits ETF. The three funds will offer investors index-based type portfolios which have characteristics similar to their respective benchmark indices (same risk level, same portfolio construction framework, etc.), while offering further information, unlike a purely passive investment, the asset management firm says in a statement. The benchmark index for the JPM Europe Research Enchanced Index Equity (ESG) fund is MSCI Europe. The second fund, focused on the United States, has the S&P 500 as its benchmark index, while the third fund selects the MSCI World as its benchmark index. “The three Etfs have fees of 25 basis points,” J.P. Morgan AM adds. The funds also integrate a systematic approach to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, which will be integrated from the start of the investment decision. p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; }
