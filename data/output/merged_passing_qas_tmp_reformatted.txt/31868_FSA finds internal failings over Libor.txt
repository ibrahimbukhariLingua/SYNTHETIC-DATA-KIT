FSA finds internal failings over Libor


The Financial Services Authority (FSA) on March 5th published its Internal Audit Report on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) covering the period January 2007 to May 2009. The report identifies that the FSA, at all levels of management, was aware of severe dislocation in the LIBOR market in the period. This report concludes that the FSA’s focus on dealing with the financial crisis, together with the fact that contributing to and administering LIBOR were not ‘regulated activities’ (which they will be from April 1st, 2013), led to the FSA being too narrowly focused in its handling of LIBOR related information. Second, taking the information cumulatively, the likelihood that lowballing was occurring should have been considered. And, third, the information received should have been better managed.The report identifies important areas where the FSA should have performed better, and makes valuable recommendations for the future, but does not suggest major regulatory failure on the scale identified in the Northern Rock (March 2008) or RBS (December 2011) reports. Finally, the internal audit draws out six lessons to be learnt for the future regulatory authorities, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), to consider. They refer to activities outside the regulatory perimeter, the clear division of responsibilities bertween the authorities, the appropriate embedment of the lessons of the report in the cultures of the regulatory authorities, the use and record of information and intelligence by these authorities, the way information circulates and escalates and, lastly the integration of the lessons from the report in the development of the record management policies.
