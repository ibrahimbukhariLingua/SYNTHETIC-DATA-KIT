La Française AM adds to PEA range


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } La Française AM is adding to its product range, with the creation of LFP France PME, which is eligible for the French PEA PME programme, and LFP PEA Flex, a flexible fund of funds, which is diversified and global under open architecture. The two new solutions come as additions to the existing PEA range, and extend the investment opportunities under an optimised tax regime. The launch of the LFP France PME fund of French equities comes as part of the global programme launched by the French government to support the development of French small businesses and start-ups. These businesses are the drivers of the economy as contributors to growth and creators of jobs. LFP France PME provides a way to invest in French SMBs with strong potential for growth over a recommended investment duration of over 8 years. The other strategy, LPF PEA Flex, is presented as an intermediate risk offering eligible for PEA. The fund of funds unites flexible allocation, multi-asset class diversification, global geographical coverage and selection in open architecture. LFP PEA Flex aims to optimise its performance after taxes over a recommended investment horizon of 3 years, while generating target ex-post volatility of 15% excluding exceptional market circumstances, and modulating exposure to equity markets between 0% and 100%.
