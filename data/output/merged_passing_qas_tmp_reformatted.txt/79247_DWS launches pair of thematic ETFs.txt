The ETFs track specially developed indices that use a unique filtering methodology, which itself uses AI processing. The methodology also focuses on identifying companies with patents in place that are most likely to make those companies significant future revenue generators. The geographic scope of the indices is global. «Our thematic ETFs are designed to focus in on up to 100 companies globally that are most likely to be the revenue winners of tomorrow, given the big societal shifts we’re seeing on the back of rapid technological advancement. Thanks to the advanced stock filtering methodology developed for the indices, we are able to provide the next generation of thematic products,» said Michael Mohr, Head of ETF Product Development. The new ETFs use direct, physical replication and have annual all-in fees of 0.35%.
