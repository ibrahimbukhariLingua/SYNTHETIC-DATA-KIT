Oddo BHF unites its asset management brands in Germany


Following numerous workshops between employees of Frankfurt-Trust and Oddo BHF AM, the Oddo BHF group has decided to merge its two German asset management entities, with the Frankfurt-Trust brand to disappear. The enlarged Oddo BHF AM entity will have total assets of over EUR61bn, with more than EUR16bn from Frankfurt-Trust Investment. Led by Nicolas Chaput, the new asset management brand will offer distributor and institutional clients a wide range of investment solutions based on complementary product ranges, a statement says. Cumulative assets under management break down as follows: EUR18bn invested in equity funds (fundamental and quantitative mangement), EUR21bn in bond funds, EUR12bn in multi-asset funds and solutions, EUR1bn in alternative strategies, and EUR10bn in mandates administrated for third parties and Kapitalverwaltungsgesellschaften (KVG) solutions in Germany. Assets under management are composed of 70% instituitonals and 30% distribution partners. 68% of clients of Oddo BHF AM are based in Germany, 26% in France, and 5% in other countries (Italy, Switzerland, Spain, the Middle East, Scandinavian markets, Asia, and Latin America). Institutional and distributor clients in Germany will continue to benefit from the same coverage, with local contacts unchanged. Under the single Oddo BHF AM brand, the asset management arm of the Oddo BHF group will unite investment centres in Dusseldorf, Frankfurt and Paris, as well as offices in Luxembourg, Milan, Geneva, Stockholm, Madrid and Abu Dhabi. The merger is subject to the approval of BaFin and consultation with employee representatives, and is expected to take effect from first half 2018.
