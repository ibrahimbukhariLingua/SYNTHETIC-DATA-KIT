Deutsche Bank forbids Postbank from selling third-party funds


In the future, advisers at Deutsche Postbank will only be allowed to recommend funds launched by the group to their clients, including products from Postbank and Deutsche Bank, its new parent company since late 2010, the Financial Times Deutschland reports. The rule forbidding the sale of third-party products is a hard blow to independent providers and/or providers who do not have their own distribution network (such as Credit Suisse, for its real estate fund CS Euroreal). Postbank has 1,100 branches and provides access to about 14 million savings investors, which will be a boon to DWS (EUR95bn in assets), the asset management firm also owned by Deutsche Bank.
