Treatment of swaps by managers is still too artisanal


Buy-side professinoals still have trouble automating certain operations, especialy on the derivatives market. According to a recent survey performed by Simcorp of 57 professionals at buy-side companies in North America, 44% of asset managers rely mainly or wholly on manual processes for the management of complex swap processes.The survey also finds that more than 50% of respondents rely at least partly on manual processes. And 55% of buy-side professionals do not have an overall view of their exposure to derivatives or to any other asset classes.This persistent inefficiency, according to Simcorp, brings exposure to considerable operational risk, in the form of a truncated view of exposures, monthly reporting which takes more time, and delays in the launch of new products.
