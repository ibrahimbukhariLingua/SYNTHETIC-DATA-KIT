Bond funds post record inflows in July


Bond funds enjoyed inflows of EUR21.7bn in July, the largest one month total in more than ten years, according to Lipper. This takes net sales for the asset class in 2012 over the EUR100bn mark (EUR107bn).Underpinning the broad move into bonds was renewed appetite for high yield and emerging market funds. The former saw record-breaking inflows of EUR7.1bn, while inflows for the latter reached EUR3.5bn (of which local currency funds accounted for EUR1.1bn). The emerging market theme was also reflected on the equity side, with global emerging markets easily the most popular equity sector (EUR550m) this month.While equity funds suffered redemptions for the fourth consecutive month, this total did improve in July, albeit to -EUR4.2bn. As a result long-term fund sales (ie excluding money market funds) reached a 4-month high of EUR14.9bn in Europe. Significant volumes moving out of money market funds (-EUR12.5bn) again looked to have helped long-term funds and suggest the most concerted move out of this asset class since the first half of 2010.The best-selling groups this month were PIMCO (EUR3.2bn), AXA (EUR2bn), BlackRock (EUR1.2bn), Pictet (EUR960m) and Carmignac (EUR910m).
