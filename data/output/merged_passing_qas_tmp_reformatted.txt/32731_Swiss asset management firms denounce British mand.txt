Swiss asset management firms denounce British mandate statistics


The publication in the UK press on 28 January of reports that significant institutional mandates were lost abroad in 2012 by Swiss asset management firms (see Newsmanagers of 28 January) has provoked a wave of protest in the local financial community, finews reports. Swiss asset managers are pointing out that the development of the Swiss industry abroad is difficult to appreciate, insofar as the statistics published do not represent equivalent comparisons. A spokesperson for Vontobel has even raised doubts about the statistics published, and provided their own figures about the evolution of mandates (2010: 17 and not zero; 2011: 37 and not 6; 2012: 21 and not zero). More generally, Swiss asset management professionals claim that the publication of such figures is rather a sign of a deliberate smear campaign against the Swiss financial industry, in order to restore the reputation of the City, which may need it.
