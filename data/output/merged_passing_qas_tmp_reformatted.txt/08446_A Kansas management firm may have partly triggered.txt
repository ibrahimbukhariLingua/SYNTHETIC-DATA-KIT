A Kansas management firm may have partly triggered the mini-crash of 6 May


Les Echos reports that the management firm Waddell & Reed (USD74bn in assets under management) on 6 May made a large futures transaction, selling 75,000 “e-minis” in a 20-minute period during which Wall Street lost nearly Usd1trn in market capitalisation. E-minis are the world’s most liquid futures, designed to allow investors to manage their exposure to the Standard & Poor’s 500 index. The transaction may have been a cause of the Wall Street mini-crash, but it does not explain everything. Safeguards designed to shut down the markets to prevent rapid falls for indices were not fully successful and will need to be revised.
