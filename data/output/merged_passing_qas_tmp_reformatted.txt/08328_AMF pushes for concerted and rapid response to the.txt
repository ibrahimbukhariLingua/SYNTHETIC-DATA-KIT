AMF pushes for concerted and rapid response to the current crisis


Jean-Pierre Jouyet is continuing to campaign for a coordinated and powerful European response to ongoing concerns on the markets. Yesterday, he reiterated his call for the creation of a “European market regulation agency,” which would have clear powers of intervention in emergency situations, decision-making and action, and which would work in liaison with the European Commission, which operates on the basis of a qualified majority decision-making system. “The markets demand precise responses, which need to be harmonised throughout Europe as a whole. That’s why I insist that only a single European agency with strict powers of application would able to bring precise responses to questions such as whether it is opportune to regulate listing procedures; or whether orders should be allowed to remain on the order books for so long before they are settled, and if so, for how long; or whether orders, once settled, should be taxed.” The president of the French financial market regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) was speaking at the 2010 conference of the AMF Scientific Council, dedicated to regulation of equities markets. Jouyet emphasized the need to create such a structure “as soon as possible.” “It is urgently needed by Europe,” he implored, “as member states and institutions are not able to react rapidly enough, meaning in the next month - and it should be no surprise that national reactions are becoming more vocal, due to the horror of the void” they are staring into. From this perspective, he continued, “French-German initiatives are more necessary than ever ... to propose a Euro zone governance plan,” and to adopt comparable measures “to combat short-selling of all shares, and particularly to strictly regulate the CDS markets.”
