German equity funds underperform by 2.5% per year


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } The Berlin-based agency Scope has analysed the results for 2,814 fund on sale to retail clients in Germany whose benchmark index is clearly identified, over one year and 10 years. On average, these products underperformed their benchmark by 2.5% year on year, and by nearly 25% over 10 years.This underperformance is largely due to total expense ratios (TER), which average 1.89% currently, while the average TER for equity ETFs on sale in Germany is 0.44%. In other words, the additional costs related to the active management of funds totalled 1.45 percentage points per year. If this is compared with average underperformance of 2.5% per year, it becomes clear that more than half of this underperformance is due to additional costs.Taking this additional cost of 1.45% per year as a basis, investors lost 15.5 percentage points over 10 years, taking into account compound interest. The additional costs related to active management thus represent nearly two thirds of the 25% average underperformance.
