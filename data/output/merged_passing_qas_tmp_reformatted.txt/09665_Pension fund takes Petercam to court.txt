Pension fund takes Petercam to court


According to the Belgian newspaper Lâ€™Echo, the Inno pension fund has filed a lawsuit in the Brussels commercial court against Petercam, which it accuses of poor management, leading to losses of about 20% for the fund, which includes a large part of the pension assets for employees belonging to the Inno labour union. The solidarity fund is seeking EUR2.3m in damages and interest from Petercam. The management firm blames the losses, however, on the poor performance of financial markets, and not on poor management.
