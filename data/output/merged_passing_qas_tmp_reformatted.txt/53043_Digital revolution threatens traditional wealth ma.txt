Digital revolution threatens traditional wealth management


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The digital revolution is a threat to traditional wealth management, and is driving increasing customer expectations. 56% of high net worth clients feel it is important for a wealth management firm to offer a digital product range, and this percentage rises to 65% among those under 45 years of age, according to a study by the consulting firm Pwc published on 1 June. For the survey, PwC interviewed 100 high net worth individuals in Europe, North America and Asia. It also interviewed 100 client advisers and directors of companies active in wealth management and financial technologies in late 2015 and early 2016. Although 69% of high net worth clients use online banking applications and 48% manage investments online, only one quarter of wealth managers offer a digital communications channel aside from email. This represents one of the least advanced areas of financial services in terms of digitalisation, the authors of the study point out. The survey finds, however, that high net worth clients are manifestly interested in new technologies. Half of those surveyed know the term robo-adviser, and 14% of respondents have already used them. 47% of respondents under 45 are planning to use these services in the future.
