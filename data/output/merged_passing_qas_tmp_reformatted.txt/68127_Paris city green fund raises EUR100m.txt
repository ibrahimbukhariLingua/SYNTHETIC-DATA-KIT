The Fonds vert de la Ville de Paris, which will finance companies which contribute to the environmental transition from the end of this year, has raised EUR100m, the mayor of the capital city, Anne Hidalgo, announced on Tuesday, 10 July, AFP reports. “EUR100m have been raised, we will go up to EUR200m, and of course the fund will manage the investment completely independently,” Hidalgo told the press alongside Stéphane Villecroze, CEO of Demeter, the investment fund responsible for the project.The first investments, which will probably arrive by the end of the year” will finance innovative companies in areas such as “building, mobility, energy, air quality, and circular economies,” Villecroze says. He explains that private investors, who represent the majority of the fund, include “Aviva and Pro BTP, who are the largest in size, but also institutional investors, industrials, and family offices.” The City of Paris and “the Caisse des Dépôts-BPI France group” are minority stakeholders in the fund, which is sworn to finance 20 primarily French companies, says Villecroze, with “EUR5m to EUR15m” each.The Paris green fund was founded in July 2017, when a partnership was signed between the city of Paris and the Caisse des Dépôts. Demeter was selected by the mayor in January this year.
