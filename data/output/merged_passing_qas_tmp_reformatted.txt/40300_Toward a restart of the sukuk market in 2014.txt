Toward a restart of the sukuk market in 2014


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } After a mixed year in 2013, the sukuk market may this year rebound to top USD100bn for the third consecutive year, the agency Standard & Poor’s estimates in a study published on 4 February. Sukuk issues launched by businesses and infrastructure vehicles from the Gulf region are expected to post double-digit growth in 2014, largely due to enormous infrastructure financing needs. In 2013, issue volumes fell by 13%. For the first time since 2007, corporate issues rose 20% last year, at a time when government issues were down by 265. This trend may continue in 2014 and 2015. In African countries, government sukuks may slowly make a place for themselves as a means of diversification compared with traditional Asian issuers of the Gulf region. However, Standard & Poor’s estimates that new regulatory conditions are necessary to strengthen market regulations, lower barriers to entry and to deepen the liquidity of these markets.
