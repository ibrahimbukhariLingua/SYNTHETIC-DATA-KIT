Asset managers expected to benefit from European banks deleveraging


Credit-oriented investment managers are expanding their assets under management (AUM) by acquiring bank-loan portfolios for their third-party clients, says Moody’s Investors Service in a new Special Comment published on 8 August (“Select Asset Managers Benefit from European Bank Deleveraging.”) These managers are also stepping in to lend third-party funds to corporates and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which have been traditionally served by European banks. Moody’s says that asset managers with the necessary credit-analysis experience are best placed to take advantage of this opportunity to engage in bank loan portfolio acquisitions and direct lending for their third-party clients. However, Moody’s notes that this opportunity is not without challenges as banks may face hurdles in selling these portfolios due to the challenges of agreeing on valuation; and several regulatory challenges will have to be overcome in order for managers to fully realise the opportunities left by deleveraging European banks. The number of jurisdictions and legal regimes within Europe requires a unique expertise to participate in both loan portfolio acquisitions and direct lending. According to the IMF’s April 2012 Global Financial Stability Report, European banks will need to reduce their assets by about EUR2trn over the course of 2011-2013.
