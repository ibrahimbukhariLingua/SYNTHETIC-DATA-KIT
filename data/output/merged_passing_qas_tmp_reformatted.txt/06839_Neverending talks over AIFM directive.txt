Neverending talks over AIFM directive


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The announcement of an agreement over the planned AIFM directive was put off last Thursday due to a lack of consensus between Parliament, the Commission and the European presidency, in another chapter to the saga, Agefi reports. Jean-Paul Gauzès, reporter to the European Parliament on the directive, is not concealing some aberrations in the redaction of the directive. The Parliament has made a large number of amendments, in total 1,690, and has thus been required to rewrite the draft. “The text is changing virtually every day,” and remains difficult to keep track of, even for lawyers, the newspaper reports. The Parliament has also blamed reversals of positions of member states, not least “France, which rallied a week and a half ago behind the idea of a European passport.” But despite the change in the French position, the question of a license for foreign funds remains at the centre of the disagreement. The UK would like to see national supervisors remain responsible for issuing licenses, while France is pushing for ESMA, the future European market supervisor, to hold the keys to the system. “The Belgian presidency will have to choose between them, putting one country out, which could be a bad sign for the future,” the reporter opines. A vote on the text is now planned for November, Agefi reports.
