Volatility derivatives have a positive effect on equity portfolios


According to a Edhec-Risk study sponsored by Eurex, the use of a long position on volatility has a strongly negative correlation with the underlying equity portfolio, which can improve the risk-adjusted performance of this portfolio. The beneficial effect is strongest for long exposures to volatility, and is most sensitive in times of falling markets.
