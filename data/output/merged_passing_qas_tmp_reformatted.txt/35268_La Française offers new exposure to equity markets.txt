The BATIK investment is a French debt security issued by the Caisse Fédérale du Crédit Mutuel Nord Europe (Standard and Poor’s rating: A- rating applicable at the time of release of this press statement. The ratings agency may modify this rating at any time). BATIK has a maximal duration of 10 years (excluding cases of anticipated automatic redemption). The investor gains exposure to the equity markets via the euro zone benchmark index EURO STOXX 50 (dividends not reinvested: the investor will not receive dividends earned by shares in the index). This security carries a risk of loss of capital during its lifetime (in case of resale before final redemption) and at maturity. As a counterbalance to this it presents potential gains of 6.20% per year in cases of rising markets, while stagnation and losses will not exceed 20%. The risks associated with this product are detailed in the brochure and the final product conditions.
