Credit Suisse gearing up for external growth in private banking


Walter Berchtold, CEO of private banking activities at Credit Suisse, has announced that his group is “clearly ready” to make acquisitions in the area of private banking. According to sources familiar with the matter, Credit Suisse has pulled out of the running to acquire the private banking affiliates of ING Groep in Asia and Switzerland, the Wall Street Journal reports.Berchtold says that Asia will be the main area of growth for the private bank in the years to come, and that Credit Suisse is “aggressively” pursuing recruitments to manage its expansion in this region, focusing on high net worth clients. The other two privileged regions will be the European Union and the Americas, particularly Latin America. Growth in activities in the Middle East, for their part, will depend on the evolution of commodity prices.
