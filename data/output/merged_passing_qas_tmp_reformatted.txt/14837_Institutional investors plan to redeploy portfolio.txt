Institutional investors plan to redeploy portfolios


Among the 150 European institutional investors with EUR926.1bn in assets in total who responded to a survey by Allianz Global Investors in March and April, 96% estimate that the increase in interest rates presents a risk to achieving their financial objectives, and nearly one quarter estimate that in the next 12 months risk will be highest. The survey was conducted before the recent increase in the interest rate by the European Central Bank last week.Insofar as a long duration in such an environment does not guarantee a satisfactory return, investment strategies need to be adapted. According to respondents to the survey, this will require more active management, with a shorter duration, and investments in equities and in commodities and real estate, says Thomas Wiesemann, chief market officer at Allianz Global Investors Europe Holding GmbH.
