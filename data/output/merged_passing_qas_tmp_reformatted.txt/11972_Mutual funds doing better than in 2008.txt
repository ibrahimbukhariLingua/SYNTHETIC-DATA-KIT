Mutual funds doing better than in 2008


According to Strategic Insight, long-term mutual funds have brought in a net USD370bn in the first seven months of the year, despite the downturn in July, which may amount to less than the USD570bn in inflows in January-July 2010, but which compares very favourably to the net redemptions of USD170bn in the corresponding period of 2008, Fundweb reports.Most of the net outflows have been concentrated on Europe, where investors were reacting to the sovereign debt crisis. But USD75bn in redemptions in July were partly offset by slightly positive inflows in Asia.
