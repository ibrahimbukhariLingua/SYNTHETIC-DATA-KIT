Five reasons for attractiveness of Italian distribution markets


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } What is the reason for the sudden popularity of the Italian distribution market with asset management firms? Richard Bruyère, chairman of the company Indefi, has identified five factors behind this phenomenon. “Firstly, this is a market of a substantial size, in third place in Europe for ownership of OPCVM fund shares by retail investors,” he says. Next, it is a market with strong growth in terms of ownership of funds, which is resulting in an inversion of the investment cycle, due to the decline of short-term products such as savings accounts and super accounts. Bruyère estimates the sums which have been reinvested in these supports at EUR150m in the past three years. The Indefi chairman also cites the presence in Italy of a distribution network which performs well via the networks of ' promotori finanziari.’ The fourth point is the existence of a retail market which offers comfortable profit margins for asset managers. Lastly, this market has lower barriers to entry than the competing Swiss or German markets,” Bruyère concludes. Although it is a direct distribution market by its nature, via networks, the Italian market is also now in the process of evolving toward more complex models, intermediated more by mandated platforms, funds of funds, etc. The remaining question is what asset classes are most popular with Italian investors. In this area there is nothing new, the head suggests: multi-asset, unconstrained bond type funds, or flexible bond funds, and lastly, international equity funds alone represent half the market, with respective market shares of 25%, 15% and 10%.
