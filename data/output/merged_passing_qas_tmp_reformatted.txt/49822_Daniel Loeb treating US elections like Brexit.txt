Daniel Loeb treating US elections like Brexit


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The billionaire Daniel Loeb, head of the activist hedge fund Third Point, has increased his hedges and reduced exposure to the market ahead of the US elections. Loeb thus hopes to insulate the fund against any unexpected results in the election which may prove reminiscent of the outcome of the British referendum in June this year, Forbes reports. This defensive strategy is demanded by the context, Loeb argues. “We very clearly had not expected the Brexit result, but we did conclude that this event made it necessary to reserve a certain percentage in case of a surprise scenario. We have done the same thing with the US elections,” the head explains. Loeb emphasises that he will take an interest in the presidential election, but that he will also be very closely monitoring Congressional election results in order to refine his investment policies over the coming months.
