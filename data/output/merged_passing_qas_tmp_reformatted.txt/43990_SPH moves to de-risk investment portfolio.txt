SPH moves to de-risk investment portfolio


SPH, the pension fund for general practitioners in the Netherlands, has moved to simplify its investment portfolio to reduce risk and cut costs, IPE reports. According to its annual report for 2014, the scheme re-invested nearly half of its â‚¬9.5bn portfolio, largely switching to passive management. It also cancelled performance fees for credit and fund-of-hedge-fund managers.
