Money market funds expected to hold out against rate drop


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; }a:link { } An interest rate drop by the ECB effective since 11 June will affect the returns on money market funds denominated in euros, which are expected to approach a zero level by the end of third quarter. Money market funds investing exclusively in government debt, and funds whose management fees are high will be the most affected, Standard & Poorâ€™s predicts in a study released on 23 June. However, the scale of the rate drop should not be expected alone to generate sufficient capital losses in the next 12 months to affect the ratings of money market funds denominated in euros, the agency adds.
