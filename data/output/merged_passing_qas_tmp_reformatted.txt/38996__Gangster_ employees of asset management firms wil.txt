“Gangster” employees of asset management firms will have to pay back bonuses


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom is planning to examine pay scales and bonus clawbacks for all regulated companies, including the 2,100 fund management firms supervised by the authority, Financial Times fund management reports. As a result, employees of asset management firms who have behaved reprehensibly are at risk of having to pay back their bonuses years after they earned them. Speialists in the sector think that asset management firms will be subject to the same rules as banks, for which the Bank of England has proposed restitution of bonuses up to six years later in cases of misconduct, shortfalls in risk management or heavy financial losses.
