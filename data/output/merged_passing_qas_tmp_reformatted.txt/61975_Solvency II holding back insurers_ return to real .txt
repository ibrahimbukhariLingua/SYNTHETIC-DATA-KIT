Solvency II holding back insurers’ return to real estate, says Edhec


In a position paper entitled “The impact of Solvency II prudential regulations on real estate financing by the insurance sector,” the economics and financial analysis and accounting research units at Edhec Business School claim that Solvency II is a factor holding insurers back from the real estate market. The 25% cost in owners’ equity of real estate investment, defined by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) with reference to the British real estate market, is highly controversial, and often considered one of the major factors preventing increase in the proportion of real estate in the portfolios of insurers. That runs against the need to balance the durations of assets and liabilities and diversification of assets under management, the study claims. “On the basis of several sources of data and several complementary methodologies, the study we have conducted finds that the cost in owners’ equity of 25% for real estate investments is overestimated. The VaRs observed in the study are highly variable geographically, and depend on the nature of the property (higher, in absolute teurms, for offices and in the United Kingdom, than for housing and the euro zone), but they are still noticeably lower than those retained in Solvency II. In other words, the risk considered by this regulation is overestimated. The potential gains of diversification between real estate and financial assets may also seem to have been underestimated,” explains Philippe Foulquier, director of the financial analysis and accounting research unit at the Edhec Business School.
