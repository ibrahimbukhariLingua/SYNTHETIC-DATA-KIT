CESR launches consultation on transparency of financial markets other than equities


The Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) on 7 May launched a consultation open until 4 June on the subject of the transparency of markets for financial instruments other than equities, as part of an ongoing examination of the MiFID directive this year. The working paper describes ways to improve post-market transparency for all of these instruments, including derivatives which had not been analysed in the past, including fixed income, equities derivatives, currency derivatives, and commodities derivatives. At the request of the European Commission, the CESR is also considering the pre-trade transparency of corporate bonds, ABS, CDO, CDS, and the aforementioned derivatives.
