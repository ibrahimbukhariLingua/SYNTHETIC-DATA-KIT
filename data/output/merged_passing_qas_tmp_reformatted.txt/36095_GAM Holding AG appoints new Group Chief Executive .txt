GAM Holding AG appoints new Group Chief Executive Officer


GAM Holding AG today announced that David M. Solo has decided to step down from his current role as Group Chief Executive Officer and from the Group Management Board effective 8 September 2014. The Board of Directors announced the appointment of Alexander S. Friedman as his successor. Solo joined the Group via GAM as CEO in 2004, then became CEO of the enlarged Asset Management division of Julius Baer in 2006. Following the separation from Julius Baer he continued as CEO of the operating entities GAM and Swiss & Global Asset Management, and finally - after moving from a pure financial holding model to an integrated structure - he assumed the role as Group CEO of GAM Holding AG in April 2013. While Friedman will take over seamlessly on 8 September 2014, Solo will assist him and the Board of Directors over the coming months to ensure a smooth transition, before pursuing new challenges. The leadership changes announced today are subject to the customary approvals by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA. Prior to joining GAM Holding AG, Alexander S. Friedman served as the Global Chief Investment Officer of UBS Wealth Management and Wealth Management Americas, as Chairman of the UBS Global Investment Committee and as a Group Managing Director. In these capacities, he oversaw the investment policy and strategy for approximately USD 2 trillion in assets.
