A hard year for Asian hedge funds


Asian hedge funds finished the year 2011 with less than shining results, Asian Investor reports. According to statistics from HFR, the HFRX Asia index including Japan lost 5.2% for the year as a whole. But excluding Japan, the Asia Emerging Markets ex-Japan index has lost 17.75%. When developed Asian markets are included, the larger Asian index has lost “only” 13.81%. In other words, hedge funds did not manage to outperform the indices, with the exception of the HFR Japan index, which is down 6.8%, compared with 17.3% for the Nikkei 225. IN fourth quarter, Asian hedge funds saw outflows of USD1.04bn, but for the year as a whole, they have seen net inflows of USD6.6bn, bringing total assets under management to USD82.1bn. Two thirds of funds invested in Asian hedge funds were allocated to equity hedge strategies. The number of Asian hedge funds rose 4% last year to 1,100 funds.
