La Française AM and S&amp;P Capital IQ forge strategic partnership


La Française AM on 21 June announced that it is teaming up with the Global Markets Intelligence (GMI) team at S&P Capital IQ, one of the major providers of multi-asset class data, research and analysis, to develop an expertise in global credit, to meet the needs of investors. Under the exclusive agreement, with the launch of a forthcoming Luxembourg-registered Global Credit fund, La Française AM will use S&P’s proprietary Risk-to-Price (R2P) methodology to guide its selection of assets and its allocation decisions. The R2P methodology calculates the extent to which returns on corporate bonds bring returns to lenders for their exposure to credit risk and the underlying market. As a part of the partnership, GMI will provide non-discretionary investment consulting services to the bond management team at La Française AM.
