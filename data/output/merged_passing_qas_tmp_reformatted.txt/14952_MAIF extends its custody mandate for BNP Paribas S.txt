MAIF extends its custody mandate for BNP Paribas SS


BNP Paribas Securities Services on 14 April announced that it has been issued a mandate to provide global custody for all non-life and life insurance assets of the MAIF Group. The contract represents EUR13bn in assets. “We previously had two different providers, of which BNP Paribas Securities Services was our provider for custody of life and non-life insurance assets. We were satisfied with the services which BNP Paribas Securities Services provided us, and after a call for proposals, we wanted to extend our agreement with this operator, to unite all our activities with a single provider,” Eric Berthoux, deputy administrative and financial director at MAIF, says in a statement.
