Absolute return label no longer favoured by FSA


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } UK asset management firms say that the Financial services authority (FSA) is privately advising them to no longer use the qualification “absolute return” for new fund launches, as this way of presenting things gives the impression that growth is guaranteed for these vehicles, Money Marketing reports. The British investment management association (IMA) in May 2008 introduced the category “absolute return,” which currently includes 50 products. Morningstar reports that six funds of this type lost money in the past year. Andy Merricks, investment director at Skerritt Consultants, claims, like some others, that the qualification “absolute return” is misleading as a label for some funds that identify themselves this way. “The label ‘absolute junk’ might be more appropriate,” says Merricks, cited by Money Marketing. The FSA had no comment on the question.
