Fund performance is rarely sustainable


According to a study by Standard & Poorâ€™s Fund Research dedicated to actively-managed US equity funds, only 5% of products manage to stay in the top 50% of funds by performance for five consecutive years, even though by an even distribution of probabilities, 6.25% should have been able to achieve that, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. For funds in the top quartile, the percentage is limited to 15%, though it should be 25%. However, funds which rank in the bottom quartile are must more often liquidated or merged than probability would predict.
