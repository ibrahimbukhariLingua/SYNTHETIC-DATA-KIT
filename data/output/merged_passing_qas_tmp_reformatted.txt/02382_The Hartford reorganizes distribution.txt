The Hartford reorganizes distribution


The Hartford Financial Services Group has announced the creation of a new structure, Hartford Life Distributors (HLD), which will handle sales and distribution for its investment and retirement products. This will result in a centralisation of internal and external sales units, marketing and support teams, and groups for strategic client assistance and the development of mutual funds, 401 (K) products and university savings programs (529). These activities represented USD25bn in deposits in the 12 months to 30 June, and currently employ a sales force of 240 focused on these areas. HLD will be headed by Kevin Connor, executive vice president, who was previously head of marketing, client assistance and development for investment and retirement products.
