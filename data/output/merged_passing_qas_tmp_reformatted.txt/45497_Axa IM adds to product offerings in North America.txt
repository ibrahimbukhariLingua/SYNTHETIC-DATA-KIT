The strategy offers US institutionals access to potential alpha from emerging businesses, with total capitalisatino between USD100m and USD2.5bn. In a segment which is known for its listing anomalies, Axa Rosenberg analyses more than 200 financial documents, out of a universe of emerging market small caps including about 6,500 companies. The proprietary bottom-up approach established by AXA Rosenberg seeks to identify ideas which are likely to generate alpha, while taking measured exposure to liquidity risks, and limiting transaction costs. The new strategy is available to US institutionals, as well as to investors in other regions of the world, via segregated accounts, a statement says.
