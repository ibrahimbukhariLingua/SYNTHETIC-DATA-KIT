ALFI unveils action plan for the next four years


The Luxembourg investment fund association (ALFI) is setting itself new ambitions. At its 20th annual conference, held on 27 and 28 September in Luxembourg, ALFI is unveiling its action plan for the next four years.In a difficult international environment, ALFI is planning to create a more propitious environment for investment funds, by highlighting their positive contribution for savings investors and society. Luxembourg is now the largest domicile for investment funds in Europe, largely due to its rapid transposition of European UCITS fund directives. “However, the recent crisis has shown the importance of better protection for savers. ALFI would like to show that UCITS funds already offer highly significant protection. Our ambition is to meet these challenges, and is based on two strong convictions: on the one hand, funds are beneficial for all; and on the other, Luxembourg is good for funds,” the president of ALFI, Marc Saluzzi, says.A reference document, “ALFI Ambition Paper 2011-2015,” translates these two convictions into five objectives: to ensure that UCITS funds remain the standard for savings investor protection; to help fund managers and institutional investors to participate in the development of regulated alternative funds, under the AIFM directive; to stimulate innovation, facilitate international fund distribution, and lastly, to strengthen the position of Luxembourg as a preferred partner in the asset management sector.In order to realise these ambitions, ALFI will work in close collaboration with its members and partners, and with all parties associated with the development of the industry. In the next few months, the action plan will be discussed by the High Market Committee, chaired by Luxembourg’s finance minister, Luc Frieden.
