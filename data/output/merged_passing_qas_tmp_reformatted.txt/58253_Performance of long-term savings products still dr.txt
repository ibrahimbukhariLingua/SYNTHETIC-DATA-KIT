Performance of long-term savings products still dragged down by fees, Better Finance finds


The most recent edition of the annual survey by the European federation of users of financial services, Better Finance, concerning the real performance of long-term savings in Europe, covering 86% of the population on the continent, has once again confirmed that a very large number of pension products massively underperform the capital markets, a statement says. They continue to earn very low or negative real long-term returns, even as markets return altogether satisfactory returns both in bonds and equities, a statement from Better Finance says. Why such mediocre performance? According to Better Finance, fees and commissions are the main culprits, particularly for individual pension products and unit-linked life insurance products. Taxation on long-term savings is also rising. Asset allocation is also responsible, Better Finance estimates, adding that the very low interest rate environment risks further penalising the returns delivered by European pension funds, which remain largely invested in bonds. Guillaume Prache, CEO of Better Finance, claims that it is urgent to act, using the retail components of the action plan of the capital markets union (CMU), including transparency of performance and fees for long-term retirement savings products, and the launch of the European retirement savings plan (PEPP).
