Vanguard not planning to launch zero-fee funds like Fidelity


In the price wars, Vanguard has no plans to follow Fidelity, which has very recently launched zero-fee funds. “The zero-fee fund is a loss-leader product, which is part of the marketing approach. Vanguard, with its mutualist structure, cannot make a zero-fee range by construction. But we constantly lower costs with economies of scale and technological innovation,” Guy Parent, CEO of Vanguard France, announced on 6 September at an autumn seminar held by Morningstar.The seminar was the occasion for the representative from Vanguard to assure that passive management still has fine days ahead of it. “The rise of passive management can be expected to continue. The fund trend is well underway, and institutional investors are increasingly demanding ETFs,” he explained. The dynamic in the sector is being driven by performance considerations. Only 20% to 30% of actively-managed funds will do better than their benchmarks. “There are factors slowing this expansion. Modes of distribution in particular can work against this movement, but the trend is there. This is all the more true as regulation, including an end to commissions, will promote development in the sector,” says Parent.Against this background, is it legitimate to be concerned about the disturbing aspect of too much growth in ETFs? “In our sense, the margin for growth in passive management is very large, before it becomes able to challenge the mechanism of price formation and the determine the valuation of a company,” says Parent. For the French market, institutional are the largest users of ETFs, by far, but the situation is developing very slowly in the direction of retail investors,” the head says.
