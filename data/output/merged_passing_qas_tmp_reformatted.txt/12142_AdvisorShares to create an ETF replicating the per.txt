AdvisorShares to create an ETF replicating the performance of a long/short equities hedge fund


AdvisorShares Investments, an active ETF firm based in the United States, with USD370m in assets under management, has formed a partnership with Commerce Asset Management, a subsidiary of Consulting Services Group which advises about USD24bn in assets, to develop an actively-managed ETF which will use Dynamic Style Analysis, a patented technique developed by Markov Precesses International. The actively-managed ETF will offer the performance of a long/short equities hedge fund, but with lower fees and daily liquidity.
