AlphaHedge launches a managed accounts platform


The US alternative management firm AlphaHedge Capital Partners has announced the launch of a managed accounts platform, which offers a range of long/short equity strategies to investment advisers, consultants, family offices, broker dealers and institutional investors. The initiative is a response to growing furstration on the part of investors after a decade of high volatility and low returns on equity markets. Long/short strategies may allow financial advisers to reduce the equity risk profiles of their clients without reducing their underlying allocations.
