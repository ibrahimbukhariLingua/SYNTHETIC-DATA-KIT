Integration of ESG criteria by institutionals takes concrete form


A full 72% of European institutional investors have drawn up formal responsible investment policies, according to a survey realized by Novethic on 185 long-term investors in 13 European countries with over EUR6tn in assets. It is an increase of 7 points on 2013.Moreover, more than half of investors integrate ESG criteria across all their asset classes (stocks, bonds, property and so on). They are more fully assuming their role as «ordering parties» and identifying clearer requirements when delegating management to asset managers. 50 % of the respondents now set ESG goals for their asset managers, twice as many as last year, and the same percentage monitor the ESG quality of their portfolios. 46% of investors are also requesting ESG reporting, up 15 points on last year. The Nordic countries and the Netherlands are the most mature, boasting the broadest range of responsible investment strategies. This is particularly true of Sweden.
