Asset management firms anticipating an increase in requests for proposals for custom institutional solutions


New research from Cerulli Associates finds that institutional asset managers expect to receive more requests for proposals (RFPs) for customized, objectives-based strategies in 2018 compared to 2017. In a survey of RFP managers and distribution professionals, when asked to compare expected RFP activity for various strategies to RFPs received last year, 63% of respondents anticipate an increase in institutional custom solutions such as liability-driven investing (LDI) for corporate defined benefit plans, while 60% expect more RFPs for multi-asset-class solutions."Although asset managers reported 2017 RFP activity mostly for standard, long-only strategies such as international and global equity or U.S. fixed income, respondents to our surveys clearly are anticipating greater interest in more complex, objectives-based strategies,» said Alexi Maravel, director at Cerulli. «LDI and multi-asset strategies such as risk-managed, absolute return, and maximum draw-down would fall in that custom solutions bucket.»
