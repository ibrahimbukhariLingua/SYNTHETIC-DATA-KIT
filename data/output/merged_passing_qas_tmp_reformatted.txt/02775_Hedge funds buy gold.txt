Hedge funds buy gold


Investment Week reports that hedge fund managers in the United States are buying gold, in anticipation of an explosion in the price of the precious metal. 20 out of 22 hedge fund managers surveyed by Moonraker Fund Management say they are buying physical gold, as they are worried that quantitative easing programs initiated by European governments will fail, provoking steep inflation.
