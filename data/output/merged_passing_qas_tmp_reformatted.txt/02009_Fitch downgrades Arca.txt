Fitch downgrades Arca


Fitch Ratings has downgraded Arca SGR’s Asset Manager Rating to ‘M3' from ‘M3+'. The rating applies to the Milan-based investment activities of Arca, but excludes alternative investments. The downgrade reflects the ongoing difficulties experienced by Arca’s shareholders in agreeing common strategic objectives to drive Arca’s asset management business forward. A previously considered share increase and integration project by three of Arca’s key shareholders - Banco Popolare Societa Cooperativa, Banca Popolare dell’Emilia Romagna and Banca Popolare di Sondrio - to merge Aletti Gestielle SGR S.p.A, an investment management company of BPSC, into Arca has to date not been realised. Further plans to open the shareholder base to domestic and foreign institutions outside the group remain under review. As a result, Arca’s senior management are constrained in their business options and future investment capacity. The downgrade also takes into account Arca’s deteriorating financial standing. Net profits fell 20% at end-2008 and a further sharp decrease is expected for 2009. This evolution reflects the crisis in Italy’s mutual fund industry which recorded unprecedented outflows exceeding EUR150bn in the 18 months to June 2008. Arca’s AUM shrank by EUR11.0bn to EUR19.1bn over the same period.
