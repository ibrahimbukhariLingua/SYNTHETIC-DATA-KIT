BNP Paribas-Fortis merger: EUR131m in synergies for Investment Solutions


BNP Paribas on Tuesday morning unveiled its industrial plan for the integration of Fortis. In the Investment Solutions unit, which includes the asset mangaement and private banking operations, EUR131m in annual synergies are predicted from 2012, equivalent to 15% of the EUR900m in synergies estimated for the group as a whole. These synergies will primarily come from “synergies in cost and the combination of management expertise,” the group explains. In asset management, the merger will raise BNP Paribas’ assets to EUR511bn, with the integration of Fortis Investments, which manages EUR163bn and operates in 34 countries, into BNP Paribas Investment Partners. This will, of course, also allow the French group to strengthen its presence on the Belgian and Dutch markets, each of which represents about one quarter of total assets at Fortis Investments. It will also give the group a new dimension in Asia, which represents 10% of assets for the firm being acquired, and 9% of the new merged group. In terms of client type, 46% of assets under management by BNP-Fortis are for businesses and institutional investors, while 41% is for individuals, and 13% via third-party distribution. In private banking, the integration of Fortis Wealth Management increases assets at BNP Paribas to EUR237bn. The group adds that it is “planning to reproduce in Belgium the internal joint venture model which has proven successful in France and Italy; BNP is also a leader in Luxembourg, with a 10% market share, and has strengthened its presence in Asian financial centres.”
