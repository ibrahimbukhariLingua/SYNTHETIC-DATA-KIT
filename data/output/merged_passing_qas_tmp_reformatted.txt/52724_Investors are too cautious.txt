Investors are too cautious


The macroeconomic outlooks are not particularly gloomy, but investors have lost their appetite for risk. They are holding piles of cash, with allocations of 5.7% as of the beginning of June, their highest level since November 2001, according to the most recent BofA Merrill Lynch survey, carried out between 3 and 9 June, and covering 213 participants representing cumulative assets under management of USD654bn. Appetite for risk and global equity allocation are at their lowest levels in four years.This aversion to risk would be coherent in a recessionary environment, but global growth and profit outlooks are at their highest levels in six months, as global inflationary outlooks are at their highest levels in one year. In this environment, BofA Merrill Lynch estimates, negative events during the summer (such as a Brexit in the near furutre, for example) represent good opportunities to buy.Invetors are putting the potential for a Brexit at the top of the list of extreme risks, followed by potential failure of the quantitative easing policies of central banks, and China, with the danger of a devaluation and business failures. However, two thirds of investors estimate that a Brexit is unlikely, which explains why 26% of them consider sterling undervalued.Two thirds of investors are not expecting US interest rates to rise this month, while 48% predict that the Bank of Japan will loosen its monetary policy in the same period.
