Two researchers take on Swedish equity funds


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } The performance of funds which invest in Swedish equities is a game of chance, with lower returns than stock markets, according to two Swedish researchers, Harry Flam, professor of international economics, and Roine Vestman, who researches at the national economy institute, both at the University of Stockholm, in an opinion column in Dagens Nyheter, one of the largest Swedish newspapers. Since 2002, Swedish equity funds have earned 1.5 percentage points less than the market, after commissions and other costs. Hundreds of billions of Swedish kroner are invested in these products. The investors therefore recommend that investors select index-based funds, which cost less than actively-managed funds. If they take this advice, investors can save 1.6% of their assets under management per year. That is equivalent to SEK5bn for investors in Swedish equity funds.
