Wells Fargo AM launches a US equity fund in Europe


Wells Fargo Asset Management, the asset management subsidiary of the US banking group Wells Fargo whose assets under management amounted to 496 billion, is launching this Thursday, February 26 in the UK, Italy, Sweden, Finland and Norway, a new compartment in its Luxembourg SICAV dedicated to all-cap US stocks. The fund should be saved eventually in most jurisdictions where Wells Fargo AM fund range is available. It will be available in retail and institutional share with TER of respectively 1.95% and 1.25%.This new compartment, US Select Equity Fund, in a SICAV which weighs some 3.5 billion, will focus on all US cap, but with a preference for small and mid caps displaying a «bias» growth or «value» component.The strategy, developed in the wake of the bear market of the 70s, has not changed in the decades that followed. «The characteristics of our investment style has not changed since the birth of the strategy,» said Richard Weiss, the manager of the fund recently visiting Paris. «The value and growth approaches should not be seen as contradictory strategies, but as interdependent variables in the valuation of securities,» said Richard Weiss.The manager bases its beliefs from an investment process that attempts to determine the PMV (Private Market Value), that is to say, the price a potential buyer is willing to pay to buy the whole of a business. Several valuation methodologies are leveraged to calculate the price, constantly revisited based on changes that may affect the business model of the company.Initially, the investment universe, after a first filtering and account values 200 to 300, and less than a hundred after a more detailed analysis. The portfolio will retain belief in the potential shopping list that thirty to forty values. Values which generally deal in a range of 50% to 80% of the PMV."The VMS allows us to take advantage of valuation inefficiencies and avoid the volatility of short-term market movements guided by low tolerance for risk,» said Richard Weiss.US Select Equity fund, which implements this strategy since 1997 and is now available to European investors, generated an annualized return of 17.8%gross and 16.6% net since its launch, compared to performance annualized over the same period from 8.3% for the Russell 2000 and 7.8%for the S & P 500 (all annualized performance from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2014).
