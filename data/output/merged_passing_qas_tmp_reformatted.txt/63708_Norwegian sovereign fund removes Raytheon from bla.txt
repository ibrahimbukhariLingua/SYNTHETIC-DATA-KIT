Norwegian sovereign fund removes Raytheon from blacklist


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Norwegian public pension fund has withdrawn the American firm Raytheon from its blacklist. The arms manufacturing giant has discontinued production of cluster bombs, the Bank of Norway announced on 25 January. The Norwegian fund, which now has NOK7.428trn (EUR830bn) in assets under management, and which follows very strick ethical policies, decided in 2005 to divest from Raytheon, which was accused of producing weapons which part of the international community was seeking to ban due to their ravages on civilian populations. “The business has ceased to produce cluster bombs, and as a result there is no longer a reason to maintain the exclusion,” the ethical board responsible for issuing decisions on investments states.
