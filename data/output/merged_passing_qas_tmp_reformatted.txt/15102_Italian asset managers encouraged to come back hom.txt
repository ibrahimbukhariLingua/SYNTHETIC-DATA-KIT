Italian asset managers encouraged to come back home


At the opening of the savings conference now being held in Milan, the Italian minister of the economy, Giulio Tremonti, renewed his proposal to offer Italian asset management firms that decide to repatriate to Italy a choice of the most favourable tax regime from among the existing regimes in the European Union, Il Sole – 24 Ore reports. Under the initiative, entitled “tax regime shopping,” a public consultation will be held. Due to disadvantageous tax regimes for Italian-registered funds, many Italian asset management firms have moved abroad. Now the tax handicap has been lifted, but are many managers prepared to return? According to initial responses collected by Il Sole – 24 Ore, many managers say they would be highly cautious about the offer.
