Financière Galilée launches a flexible fund


Financière Galilée is adding to its range of funds with the launch of a global flexible fund of funds. The fund, entitled Galilée Fund Picking Strategy, is managed by Roni Michaly, also designer of the selection model and CEO of Financière Galilée. The mutual fund was launched on 10 July 2017. A statement says that the Galilée Fund Picking Strategy fund may invest in funds of all geographical regions, all cap sizes and all sectors, following the proprietary 6-step selection process of Financière Galilée. The management objective is to outperform the benchmark indicator (35% MSCI World + 35% Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate TR + 30% EONIA Capitalised). “This is a 100% flexible fund of funds, whose allocation strategy seeks optimal diversification of asset management firms, managers, regions and themes,” Michaly explains. The fund is a flexible vehicle, appropriate for all types of investors with a balanced risk profile (DICI risk 4/7) who seek long-term capital growth. The structure of the fund will accept 10 to 15 funds. Financière Galilée, founded in 2000 and based in Strasbourg, is active mainly in selection of funds for multi-management portfolios.
