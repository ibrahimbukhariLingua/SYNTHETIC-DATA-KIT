Pension funds that pay high fees lose money


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In the United States, public sector pension funds which pay the highest investment fees do not necessarily earn the highest returns, a study undertaken by the Maryland Public Policy Institute and the Maryland Tax Education Foundation, cited by the Wall Street Journal, have found. In fact, rather the reverse is true. On average, the ten states which pay the highest management fees have posted lower returns on investment than the ten that paid the lowest fees between 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2012.
