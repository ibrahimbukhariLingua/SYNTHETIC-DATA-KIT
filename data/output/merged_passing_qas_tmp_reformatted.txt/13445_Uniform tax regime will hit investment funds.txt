Uniform tax regime will hit investment funds


Changes to the Italian tax regime will bring the withholding tax on all vehicles to 20%, except for government bonds, which will continue to be taxed at 12.5%.The changes will favour traditional products such as savings accounts, but will work to the disadvantage of futures accounts and directly held securities (equities and corporate bonds), ETFs, and other investment funds, for which the tax rate had previously been 12.5%, Il Sole â€“ 24 Ore reports.In addition, the government is planning to raise the stamp duty on securities accounts to EUR120, from EUR34.20, which could lead savings investors to avoid types of vehicles for which holding a securities account is compulsory.
