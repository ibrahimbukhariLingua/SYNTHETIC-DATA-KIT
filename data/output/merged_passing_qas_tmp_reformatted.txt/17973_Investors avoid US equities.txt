Investors avoid US equities


Going into the Thanksgiving holiday weekend investors continued bailing out of US equity and high yield bond funds as US lawmakers addressed themselves to the so-called fiscal cliff that looms in early 2013, according to EPFR. Although China’s improving story attracted some interest -- and cash -- the week’s biggest inflows were recorded by money market funds, with the cash equivalent vehicles absorbing over USD21 billion.Overall, EPFR global-tracked equity funds posted collective outflows of USD7.74 billion during the week ending Nov. 21 while bond funds took in a net USD4.97 billion. Emerging markets bond and equity funds both took in over USD1 billion.
