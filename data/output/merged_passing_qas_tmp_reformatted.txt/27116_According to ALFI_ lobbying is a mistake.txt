According to ALFI, lobbying is a mistake


The European fund sector can only blame itself for the avalanche of regulations which followed the financial crisis, says Marc Saluzzi, chairman of the Luxembourg investment fund association, in an interview with Financial Times fund management. “If we had invested half of what we invested in lobbying in the past few years into educating investors, and explained that we can be a solution and not a problem, we could have saved a lot of money for the sector,” he says.
