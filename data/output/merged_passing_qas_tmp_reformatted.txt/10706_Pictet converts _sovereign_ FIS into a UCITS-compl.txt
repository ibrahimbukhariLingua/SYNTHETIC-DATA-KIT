Pictet converts “sovereign” FIS into a UCITS-compliant fund


The PTR total return range from Pictet (Corto, Mandarin, Kosmos) has now gained a new product (Sicav part I), entitled Banyan (after the tree of wisdom under which Buddha awakened), focused on Asia ex Japan. The long/short product is managed in London by Nidhi Mahurkar, with the assistance of Anthony Cheung, a specialist in Greater China who has recently joined Gartmore, and Olivier Doleires for the risk management portion.The new UCITS-compliant fund with weekly liquidity was launched on 2 November, and began with assets of USD180m, because it was born out of the transformation of a Luxembourg specialised investment fund (SIF) which was created for a Middle Eastern sovereign fund and which will now be made available to institutional and retail investors (there is not yet a sales license for France).The original FIS fund generated annual returns of 16.8% from its launch un July 2002, compared with 12.8% for the MSCI Emerging Asia. The portfolio may include 50 to 90 positions; it currently includes 60 positions, of which 35 are long and 25 are short, and gross exposure totals 130% to 135%, and a net 40% to 90%. A very strict liquidity overlay allows for 95% of the portfolio to be liquidated in less than one day. On average, turnover comes out to 350%, while the short book’s turnover is larger than the long one’s.Mahurkar says that it is a bottom-up, stock-picking approach focused on large and midcaps, and that managers are careful to avoid leverage, illiquidity and concentration. It looks for good cash flows, high profits, and solid balance sheets.CharacteristicsName: Pictet Total Return-BanyanISIN codes:LU0637929265 (I share class, EUR1m and up)LU0637929778 (P share class)Management commission1.10% (I shares)1.60% (P shares)Administrative and custody fees: 0.40%Performance commission: 20% with high watermarkHurdle rate: Libor USD 3 monthWithdrawal notice: 5 days before publication of net asset value (Friday 5 PM in Luxembourg)Shares hedged for currency risks are available in euros, pounds Sterling and Swiss francs
