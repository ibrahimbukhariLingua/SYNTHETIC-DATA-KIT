Brexit: FCA and ESMA sign a memorandum of understanding


Confirming reports by the FT and Reuters on 1 February, the Financial Conduct Authority, the British financial market regulator, has announced that it has signed a memorandum of agreement with ESMA and the regulators of local financial markets in Europe. The agreement will be applicable only if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a deal at the end of March. The memorandum signed between the FCA and ESMA covers monitoring of credit ratings agencies and central repositories. A separate memorandum signed between the FCA and local regulatory authorities in Europe covers cooperation in monitoring, the application of laws, and information sharing concerning market surveillance, investment services and asset management activities. These memoranda will make it possible to outsource portfolio management to British asset management firms, on behalf of third parties based in the European Economic Area, in case of a no-deal Brexit.
