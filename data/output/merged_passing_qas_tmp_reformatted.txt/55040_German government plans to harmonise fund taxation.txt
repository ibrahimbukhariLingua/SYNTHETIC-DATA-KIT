German government plans to harmonise fund taxation


The German government has unveiled a bill on investment fund taxation which would harmonize taxation of funds domiciled in the country with those applied to funds domiciled abroad. German legislation has previously applied different taxation to the two categories of funds, with funds domiciled in Germany avoiding a 15% tax on capital gains, a practice which could be considered discriminatory by European law.The bill would impose a single tax of 15% for both categories of fund, with retail investors receiving tax exemption of 30% on equities, 155 on multi-asset and 60% to 80% for real estate funds. The bill would also introduce a required holding period of at least 45 days for equities to combat the high turnover which some investors engage in to avoid dividend tax. The German association of asset managers (BVI) estimates that these measures are a move int eh right direction, but that a lot still could be done in the institutional fund (Spezialfonds) sector, whose legal framework does not appear to need modification.
