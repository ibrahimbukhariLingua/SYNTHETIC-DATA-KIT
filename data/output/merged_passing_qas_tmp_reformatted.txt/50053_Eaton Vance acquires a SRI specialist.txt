Eaton Vance acquires a SRI specialist

The operation, neither the price nor the conditions of which have been disclosed, is expected to be completed by 31 December 2016. At the conclusion of the transaction, Calvert will become a wholly-owned affiliate, and will be renamed as Calvert Research and Management. As a part of this change, new investment advising agreements will be signed between the newly-created affiliate and common invesment funds from Calvert (Calvert Funds), Eaton Vance indicates in a statement. The Calvert Investment Management company, founded in 1976, specialised very early in socially responsible investment, with the launch of the Calvert Social Investment Fund in 1982 (now the Calvert Balanced Portfolio), the first mutual fund to oppose all investment in South Africa due to Apartheid. As of the end of September 2016, Calvert Investment Management had about USD12.3bn in assets under management.
