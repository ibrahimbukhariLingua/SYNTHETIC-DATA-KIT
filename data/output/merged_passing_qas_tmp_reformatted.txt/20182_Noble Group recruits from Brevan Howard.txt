Noble Group recruits from Brevan Howard


The commodity specialist Noble Group, based in Hong Kong, is recruiting in the base metals segment (including copper and zinc), with the recruitment of two senior traders, who would allow the firm to develop beyond its native market in Asia, the news agency Reuters reports. Mark Hansen, previously of Brevan Howard, has joined Noble Group to become head of its “global metals” unit, based in London. Paul Wilkes, previously of Macquarie Bank, will be joining the firm next month to head up the proprietary trading desk.
