Swissquote acquires Internaxx


The Swiss online bank Swissquote, known largely for its crypto-currency activities, has announced that it has completed its acquisition of the Luxembourg bank Internaxx. At a release of its 2018 results, the Swiss firm said that it received permission from the European Central Bank and the Luxembourg financial sector surveillance commission (CSSF) on 6 March this year. “The acquisition of Itnernaxx gives Swissquote unlimited access to European markets, and further strengthens its position as a preferred provider of online investments to institutional and private clients. The range of services from Internaxx will be enriched by a wider range of products and access to new investment platforms,” the firm says in a statement.
