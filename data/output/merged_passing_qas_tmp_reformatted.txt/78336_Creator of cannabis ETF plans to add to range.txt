Creator of cannabis ETF plans to add to range


Horizons ETFs Management Canada, the creator of the first marijuana ETF, is seeking to enlarge its product range, Bloomberg reports. The provider of the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF is actively at work on creating an ETF which will contain only producers who are licensed in the United States, according to CEO Steve Hawkins, who explains that the move aims to meet demand on the part of investors. The firm has also submitted a prospectus for a leveraged ETF and an inverse ETF. However, the company no longer plans to launch an inverse leveraged marijuana ETF. HMMJ is the largest Canadian ETF for cannabis, with over CAF750m in assets.
