Conflict of interest suit at Sal. Oppenheim


Manager Magazin reports that a group of partners at Sal. Oppenheim is preparing a lawsuit for conflict of interest against the directors of the bank, who, like them, are members of the owning families. The dispute is over a EUR300m loan issued by the bank four years ago to Madeleine Schickedanz, the largest shareholder in Arcandor. The loan is said to have been guaranteed by, among others, the chairman of the managing partners, Matthias, Count of Krockow, and the chairman of the supervisory board, Georg, Baron von Ullmann. The partners planning to challenge the move suspect the executives of the bank of having subsequently decided to provide massive aid to Arcandor (Sal. Oppenheim became the largest shareholder in the retail group) in order not to be personally obliged to supply funds to cover the guarantee on the loan. With the bankruptcy of Arcandor, the bank made heavy losses and will now be obliged to be acquired by Deutsche Bank.
