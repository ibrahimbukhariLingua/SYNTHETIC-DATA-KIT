EFAMA lays out an ambitious catalogue of priorities


At a presentation by the European asset management association (EFAMA) in Paris, chairman Christian Dargnat, with the assistance of Peter de Proft, deputy CEO, laid out the priority action principles for the coming months. Two of them are familiar: the ambition to speak with a strong and united voice on behalf of all actors in the industry, particularly when confonted with regulator(s) and a need to convince all actors that asset managers represent the interests of their clients and are not acting for their own account. The other two priorities follow from the first. EFAMA hopes to achieve a perception of like asset management firms at last as long-term investors in Europe, which will include the promotion of an appropriate vehicle, ELTIF (European Long Term Investment Fund), which may not necessarily match up with the liquidity requirements of Ucits Funds, and OCERP (Officially Certified European Retirement Product), the cross-border, truly portable pension fund.A fourth point is that EFAMA hopes to demonstrate that asset management firms bring real added value within the European economy: capital is needed in order to feed economic growth, in order to channel savings, and to place them optimally.Dargnat does not conceal the fact that the asset management sector is facing three major threats. Firstly, “to reman politically correct, we are about to reach overregulation,” the EFAMA chairman says.Next, EFAMA is calling for equal treatment for all products, either from asset management firms, banks, or insurers (level playing field), with the PRIPS directive.The third concern is related to the increasing fragmentation of the market in sales.Concerning the financial transaction tax (FTT), Dargnat claims that, if it were applied as it is in only 11 countries of the Union, it would generate a capital and brain drain while bringing little in for the states, as the tax base would contract.
