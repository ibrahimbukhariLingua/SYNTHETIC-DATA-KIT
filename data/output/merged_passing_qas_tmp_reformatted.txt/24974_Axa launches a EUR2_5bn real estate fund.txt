Axa launches a EUR2.5bn real estate fund


Axa has raised a fund which will invest up to EUR2.5bn in the development of offices and shopping centres in continental Europe, in order to profit from a gap left open by the withdrawal of banks and other credit providers from the real estate market, the Financial Times reports. The fund has raised EUR585.5m, largely from pension funds and insurers.
