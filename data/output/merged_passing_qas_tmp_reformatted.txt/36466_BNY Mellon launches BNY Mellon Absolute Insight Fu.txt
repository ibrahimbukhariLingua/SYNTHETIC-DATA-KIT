p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } BNY Mellon Investment Management has announced the launch of the BNY Mellon Absolute Insight Fund, a multi-strategy absolute return fund with daily liquidity in UCITS format, domiciled in Dublin (see Newsmanagers of 1 July 2014) in France. The fund will be managed by Insight Investment. “This new fund comes as an addition to our range of absolute return funds, which has had real success with French investors. We would like to become an irresistible actor in this asset class in France. The strategy of the absolute return fund is very interesting in our context, as managers have more flexibility to generate positive returns. The success of Insight in absolute return strategies, and the extent of its expertise, will allow us to offer French investors a fund which really meets their demand; absolute return approaches will play an increasingly important role in portfolios,” says Anne-Laure Frischlander.
