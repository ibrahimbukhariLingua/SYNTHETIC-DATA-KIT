RDR regulation favours ETFs


A British law forbidding kickback commissions to independent financial advisers planned to come into effect in 2013 with the passage of the Retail Distribution Review (RDR) is now boosting sales of ETFs, according to BlackRock, Investment Europe reports. Assets in iShares funds subscribed over ETF platforms rose 34% in 2011, to a total of GBP746m. Since first quarter 2010, the increase totals 175%. “With the law against commissions to independent financial advisers, ETFs are treated in the same way as other investment products. This development, coupled with the the low cost of ETFs and their easy availability on many markets, is a sign that the use of ETFs by independent financial advisers and discretionary managers will be likely to continue to increase,” the head of iShares UK, Davis Bower, says.
