ETFlab releases Euro Stoxx 50 short ETF


As announced in Newsmanagers a month ago, ETFlab, an affiliate of Deka (German savings banks) has launched its first short ETF. The ETFlab DJ EURO STOXX 50Â® Short provides an inverse replication of the Euro Stoxx 50 index (see Newsmanagers of 16 November). It is a German-registered product (DE000 ETFL334), with fees of 0.4%. the product is aimed at experienced investors. For the first time, ETFlab is using a synthetic form of replication via complementary swaps, rather than a total physical replication.
