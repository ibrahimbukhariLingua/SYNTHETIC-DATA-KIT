Andreas Utermann in favour of prohibiting crypto-currencies


Utermann is concerned that crypto-currencies will swallow the savings of retail clients. “You will have to prohibit them,” Utermann said at a round table in London, speaking to Andrew Bailey, chairman of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the British market regulator. “I am personally surprised that regulators have not done more.” Bailey, sitting next to him, countered that regulations are “rather strict” as they are, but added that crypto-currencies have “no intrinsic value.” “We are monitoring this very closely,” the regulator said, noting that capital raised for initial coin offerings (ICO) were the subject of particularly close oversight.
