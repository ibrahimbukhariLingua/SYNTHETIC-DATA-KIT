RepRisk teams up with AfU IR for sustainable development reporting


The Swiss firm RepRisk on 13 February announced that it has signed a cooperation agreement with the Frankfurt-based AfU Investor Research to launch a “sustainable development” investment fund filtering product.Analysis is based on a methodology which uses the RepRisk methodology for each business in the portfolio, to determine a sustainability rating which reflects the Reputation Risk Indiator (RRI) for the fund concerned. The rating is weighted according to the size of each position in the portfolio of the fund in quesiton.A joint study by RepRisk and AfU IR undertaken in 2012 found that conventional funds have ratings virtually as good as funds which are designed specifically to take environmental, social and governance issues into account.The new joint product, which is aimed at asset managers, private banks, institutional investors and consultants, will provide clients with the average RRI rating for positions in the fund and their long-term evolution, the distribution of positions in the portfolio between various risk classes, an analysis of the peer group, and a comparison with the five best and worst funds in the same risk category.
