The trends are: technologies, demography, globalisation, the environment, and societal evolution.The investment programme targets French and European investors seeking returns in an environment of low interest rates and sources of diversification, the firm says in a statement. Amundi PEF is aiming to raise EUR250m in funds for the new programme. “For several years, ‘mega-trends’ have acted as disruptive and transformative forces in all sectors of the global economy,” the firm observes. “Our team observes that in Europe, despite a listless economy, many SMBs and intermediate-sized enterprises are enjoying strong growth. The common point for these businesses is that they all benefit from at least one of five identified ‘mega-trends.'” The invetsment programme aims to acquire active minority stakes as part of venture capital and capital transmission in businesses with high quality margins, a strong history of profitability, organic or external growth objectives and solid financial fundamentals. The average purchase price for these stakes will range from EUR10m to EUR35m, with an objective of a gross internal rate of return of 20% per operation.
