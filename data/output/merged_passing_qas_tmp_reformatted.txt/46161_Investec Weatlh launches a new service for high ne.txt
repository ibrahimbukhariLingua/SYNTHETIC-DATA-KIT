p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The British firm Investec Wealth & Investment on 21 April announced the launch of Private Office, a new range of integrated services aimed at high net worth individuals (HNWI), entrepreneurs and investors with complex needs, and wealth of under GBP10m. The new offer is the result of a market study, which found that the high net worth client segment is poorly served. The services in the new range include custom portfolio management, structuring, private banking, financial planning, advising, consulting, corporate finance, and institutional brokerage. The new service is directed by Andrew Butler-Cassar, a specialist in high net worth clients, with a team of 19 professionals.
