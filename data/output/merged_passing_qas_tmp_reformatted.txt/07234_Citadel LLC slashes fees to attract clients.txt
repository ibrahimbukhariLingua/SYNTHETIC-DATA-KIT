Citadel LLC slashes fees to attract clients


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Bloomberg reports that Citadel LLC is planning to slash the management fees for its two largest hedge funds – Kensington and Wellington – in order to attract new clients, as inflows are at their worst levels for two decades. Citadel lost 55% of its assets in the stock market declines of 2008, and when investors sought to withdraw USD1.2bn, the firm was obliged to suspend redemptions, which were reopened in late 2009. Even after returns og 62% last year, and gains of 4% in 2010, funds still need to gain 30% for investors to break even.
