In an interview with Fondsnieuws, Bert Bruggink, chief financial officer at Rabobank, has stated that Robeco funds will continue to be available to customers of its former parent company, even after its recent acquisition by Japan’s Orix, as part of open architecture which has been in place for several years. Previously. Robeco had been the exclusive provider for Rabobank.The CFO also states that the sale of Robeco is not directly related to a desire to increase owners’ equity at Rabobank in order to comply with Basel III, as many media sources are reporting, as the group’s regulatory ratios are already high.
