Feri recommends real assets for charities


As returns on bunds are at record low levels, and high-risk investments in equities and private equity remain off limits, Feri Finance is recommending a double strategy for charities to confront an expected rise in inflation: on the one hand, investment in tangible assets such as gold, forests, and commodities, and on the other hand, an active risk management policy, the BÃ¶rsen-Zeitung reports. Although the roughly 17,000 charities in Germany have succeeded in surviving the financial crisis undamaged due to conservative investment policies, they are now confronting difficulties in earning the necessary returns.
