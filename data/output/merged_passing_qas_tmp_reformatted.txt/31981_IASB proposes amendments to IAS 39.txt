IASB proposes amendments to IAS 39


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The designer of international accounting standards IASB on 29 February published a report describing a series of amendments to the IAS39 standard for financial instruments. The amendments will then be integrated into the chapter dedicated to hedge accounting in IFRS 9 on financial instruments (which will replace IAS 39). The objective for the improvements is to introduce an exception to planned discontinuation of hedging in IAS39. More precisely, it is proposed that an exception will be made whenever a derivative presented as a hedging instrument loses its original counterparty in order to become a contract with a central counterparty (CCP). Participants can present their comments during a shortened 30-day period, due to the forthcoming introduction of new regulations on OTC trading in some countries, required by the G20 to improve transparency and to provide better surveillance of this market segment.
