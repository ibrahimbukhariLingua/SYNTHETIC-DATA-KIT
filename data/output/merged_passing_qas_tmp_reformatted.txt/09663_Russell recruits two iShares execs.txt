Russell recruits two iShares execs


James Polisson and Andrew Arenberg, both of whom were involved in the setting up of the iShares operation at Barclays Global Investors (BGI), in mid-January joined Russell Investments (USD176bn in assets), Polisson as managing director of global ETF business, and Arenberg as managing director of global ETF distribution. They will be based in San Francisco. The two men will be responsible for the design of new-generation products and services related to ETFs, says Andrew Doman, president and CEO of Russell, who says the group is already one of the largest providers of indices to ETF management firms.
