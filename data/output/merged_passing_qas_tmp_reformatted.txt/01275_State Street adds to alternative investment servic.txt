State Street adds to alternative investment services


State Street Corporation announced on 1 December that it is expanding its global capacities in services dedicated to alternative investments and fund administration with an agreement to acquire Mourant International Finance Administration (MIFA) through a cash transaction. MIFA, with headquarters on the Channel island of Jersey, nearly USD170bn in assets under administration, and about 650 employees in Dublin, Singapore and New York, is one of the largest providers of fund administration services, particularly for alternative investors such as private equity funds, real estate funds and hedge funds. The acquisition will make State Street the largest provider of alternative investment services in the world, with USD600bn in assets under administration. The conclusion of the transaction, pending approval from the regulatory authorities and other contractual conditions, is slated for first quarter 2010. State Street estimates that the transaction will have a slightly positive effect on its results for 2010, excluding one-time charges.
