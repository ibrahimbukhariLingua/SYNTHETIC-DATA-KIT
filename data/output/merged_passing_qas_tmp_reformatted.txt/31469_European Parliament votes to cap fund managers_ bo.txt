European Parliament votes to cap fund managers’ bonuses


Investment fund managers’ bonuses must be capped, their salaries must be linked to their funds’ performance said Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee MEPs in a draft law voted on Thursday. Individual investors’ money must also be better protected, they added. «The UCITS bonus cap will help strengthen investor protection and reduce risky speculation. It will also complement the recently-adopted EU rules capping bankers’ bonuses, ensuring these rules cannot be circumvented and providing for a level playing field» said lead MEP Sven Giegold. The European Parliament plenary will vote in April on whether to give a mandate for three-party negotiations with EU member states and the European Commission.
