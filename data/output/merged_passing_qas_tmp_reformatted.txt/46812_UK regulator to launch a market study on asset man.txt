UK regulator to launch a market study on asset management


UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has announced it will launch a market study on asset management in 2015/16 as part of its 2015/16 business plan. «We will develop the full scope during 2015/16, but the issues we will examine will include the charges paid by investors, and the factors that drive those charges», it says. The regulator will also conduct a «post authorisation review of funds». «We will review whether new UK authorised investment funds and segregated mandates are operated in line with our rules including all documentation, marketing material, disclosure material or investment mandates. We will also consider compliance with other responsibilities to investors such as adherence to risk management parameters». The business plan 2015/16 of the FCA «sets out to parliament, to consumers and to the firms we regulate how we plan to pursue our objectives, what our priorities are and how we will measure our success. It is, in conjunction with our Annual Report, critical for holding us to account».
