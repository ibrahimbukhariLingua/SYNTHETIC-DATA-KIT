Threadneedle touts stock-picking


At a presentation in Frankfurt, Sarah Arkle, CIO of Threadneedle, claimed that equities are still a good investment after the increases on the markets in 2009, but that investors should now focus on stock-picking, the BÃ¶rsen-Zeitung reports. She also thinks that there is currently more danger of deflation than inflation. Some observers are asking what measures can still be taken if deflation begins to occur. Central banks are now expected to keep their prime rates at their current, extremely low levels, for some time.
