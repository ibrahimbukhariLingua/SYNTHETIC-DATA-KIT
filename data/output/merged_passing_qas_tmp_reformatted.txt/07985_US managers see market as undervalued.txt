US managers see market as undervalued


According to the most recent quarterly survey by Russell Investments, nearly half (47%) of US managers surveyed estimate that the market is undervalued, while only 28% thought so in the March survey. Only 9% see the market as overvalued. “Managers estimate that the market is undervalued, but they would also like to see a very significant increase in profits and some improvement in the job market before taking risks,” says Mark Eibel, director and head of client investment strategies at Russell Investments. 73% of managers cite economic trouble in Europe as a significant risk to the performance of US equities in the next 12 months. A vast majority of managers, showing a high sensitivity to risk, have given more weight to defensive sectors. Interest in money markets rose 10 percentage points to 16%, from the all-time low observed in March of this year. Treasuries gained only 6 points to 12%, while consumer sectors and utilities gained 5 points and 9 points, respectively. The IT sector lost 10 points, but remains the most popular, with 69% positively inclined.
