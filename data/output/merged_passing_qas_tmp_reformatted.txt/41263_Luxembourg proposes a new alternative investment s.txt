Luxembourg proposes a new alternative investment structure


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Luxembourg investment fund association (ALFI) has welcomed the publication of a draft law which would create a new investment structure, the Reserved Alternative Investment Fund (RAIF). The draft legislation, which by definition is liable to be modified in the next few months, would be passed in first quarter 2016. The new structure is an alternative investment fund (AIF), which would have characteristics very similar to those of the specialised investment fund (SIF) or a Luxembourg Sicar (risk capital investment company), but with a big difference: the RAIF would not need approval by the financial sector surveillance commission (CSSF), and would not be supervised by the Commission either. Currently, FIAs, such as SIF or Sicar vehicles, are authorized and supervised by the CSSF.
