Sparinvest SICAV converts to UCITS IV format


An extraordinary general shareholdersâ€™ meeting for Sparinvest SICAV (14 sub-funds), held on 30 September, voted to bring the Sicav fund into compliance with the UCITS IV directive, following the issuance of a license to the asset management firm Sparinvest S.A. by the CSSF in July this year. Shareholders also approved the appointment of a new board of directors, with the aim of internationalising the fund. Sparinvest has announced the appointment of three influential people in the world of finance to the board of directors at Sparinvest SICAV. They are Torben Nielsen, chairman, who is a former governor of the Danish central bank (Danmarks Nationalbank), Benedicte Vibe Christensen, former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and Peter Reedtz, director and owner of the Danish asset allocation institute.
