State Street develops partnership with Mitsui Fudosan


The financial services provider State Street Corporation on 29 June announced that it is extending its partnership with Mitsui Fudosan, a Japanese real estate firm, to offer administration and trustee services for two new real estate funds, Moorgate Property Unit Trust and Mark Lane Property Unit Trust. State Street had originally been retained by Mitsui Fudosan, one of the largest Japanese real estate asset management firms, in 2008, to assist it in its development on the real estate market in the United Kingdom, providing administration services for the 5 Hanover Square Unit Trust. The decision by Mitsui Fudosan to extend its range of Jersey Property Unit Trusts (JPUTS) reflects a rising interest on the part of investors in the real estate market in the United Kingdom.
