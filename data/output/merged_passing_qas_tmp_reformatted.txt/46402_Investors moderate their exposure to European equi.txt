Investors moderate their exposure to European equity funds


Data for the week ending April 8 show Europe equity funds on track to post their 13th consecutive weekly inflows. The flows into these funds, while still healthy, are running below the levels seen from mid-February to late March. Mutual fund flows during the first week of April followed the pattern in place for much of the year-to-date, with investors pulling money out of US and China equity funds and steering money into balanced funds, US bond funds and Europe, global ex-US and Japan equity funds. Overall, bond funds have taken in over USD6 billion and money market funds around USD14 billion while net flows for all equity funds have been essentially neutral, according to EPFR Global. EPFR Global notes that institutional investors continue to drive the redemptions from China equity funds, which now exceed USD9 billion, as they sell into a rally driven by domestic retail investors. That rally has driven Shanghaiâ€™s benchmark index to a seven year high but raised fears of a sharp correction when speculative momentum fades.
