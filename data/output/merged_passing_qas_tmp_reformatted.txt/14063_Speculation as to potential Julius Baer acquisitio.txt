Speculation as to potential Julius Baer acquisition of Sarasin not convincing


Agefi Switzerland reports that some are predicting that CHF100bn in assets under management are no longer enough to make a firm competitive internationally, and particularly not enough for a bank like Sarasin, which has a cost/earnings ratio of more than 70%. This fact makes a potential acquisition of the structure by Julius Baer Group appear all the more likely. Such an operation would give rise to a bank with over CHF270bn in assets under management. The obstacles to such a move are, however, considerable: rivalry between the business cultures of Zurich and Basel, and how to assign management positions in the new group are not least among them. Independance for Sarasin would rather go through a vote to approve a merger of its management with those of external investors. Rabobank, which controls 68.6% of voting rights and 46.1% of capital in Sarasin, says that it is not planning to divest anytime soon, even though private management is not a core profession for it.
