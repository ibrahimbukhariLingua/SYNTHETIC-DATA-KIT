Galleon to liquidate all its hedge funds


Galleon Group is liquidating all its hedge funds just days after insider trading allegations against Raj Rajaratnam, its founder and president, sparked a wave of investor withdrawals, says the Financial Times. Mr Rajaratnam told clients in a letter that it was in their interest to conduct an ”orderly wind down” of Galleon’s funds while exploring various options for the business. Potential buyers have approached the group, according to a source familiar with the situation.
