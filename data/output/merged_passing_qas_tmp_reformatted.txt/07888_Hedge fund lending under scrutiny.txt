Hedge fund lending under scrutiny


According to a study by four university professors (Debarshi Nandy, Nadia Massoud and Keke Song of the Schulich School of Business, Toronto, and Anthony Saunders of the Stern School of Business at New York University), at 105 US firms which borrowed money from hedge funds between January 2005 and July 2007 (before the US regulatory authorities required more information on short positions), there was an average increase of 74.8% in short-selling of shares in those companies in the five days preceding the announcement of the loan. In contrast, The Wall Street Journal reports, there was no observed increase in short positions on shares in firms which borrowed money from banks in the same period. Short positions increased by 28.4% preceding the announcement that loans from hedge funds had been renegotiated, compared with a decline of 17.8% before the same announcements about bank loans. But it is not certain that the lending hedge funds themselves were the ones assuming these short positions.
