Schroders replies to Bestinvest “spot the dog” rankings


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In a note distributed to some British media outlets, Schroders claims that it is disapopinted in the “Spot the Dog” rankings of the worst investment funds recently published by Bestinvest (see Newsmangers of 22 July). The manager objects that Bestinvest has included the Shroder QEP Global Active Value fund in its rankings without taking into consideration that the fund is primarily institutional, and that only GBP20m of its GBP3.2bn in assets are held by retail investors.In a response to Schroders from a spokesperson for Money Marketing, Bestinvest remarks that the fund in question is available on several retail platforms such as Cofunds and Fundsnetwork, and clearly has a retail share class. It is thus eligible for inclusion in the rankings.
