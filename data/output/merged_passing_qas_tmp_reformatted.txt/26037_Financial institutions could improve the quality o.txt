Financial institutions could improve the quality of their information


The European securities markets authority (ESMA) on 18 November published its conclusions on the comparability and quality of financial information published by publicly-traded financial establishments.ESMA, which has studied a sample of 30 major financial institutions for most banks included in the most recent evaluation period of the European banking authority, has laid out a series of recommendations which are expected to improve the transparency of financial information in some key areas, including credit risk, financing and liquidity risks, and the fair valuation of financial instruments. ESMA observed that it was difficult to compare the information published by banks due to disparities in the structure of financial reports, or because the use of derivative financial instruments is not sufficiently documented in financial reports. In light of its conclusions and recommendations, ESMA claims that from 2013, the financial sector will need to offer improved information on exposure to credit risks, means to limit thi exposure (collateral, guarantees or credit default swaps, or CDS), as well as analysis of specific concentrations of credit risk and depreciation strategies in order to allow investors to evaluate overall credit risk. ESMA has also published the final version of its technical standards concerning derivative trades carried out by counterparties not belonging to the European Union.
