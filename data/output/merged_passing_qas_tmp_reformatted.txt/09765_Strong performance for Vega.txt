Strong performance for Vega


The hedge fund management firm Vega, whose assets have fallen to USD500m, after peaking at USD12bn in 2004, has posted performance in 2009 of 93.85% for the Vega Select Opportunities fund (but 70.6% for subscribers who pay commissions), and 62.34% for the Vega Global fund, Cotizalia reports. The good results for Vega Global are largely attributable to positions taken by the manager, Ravi Mehra, on currencies.
