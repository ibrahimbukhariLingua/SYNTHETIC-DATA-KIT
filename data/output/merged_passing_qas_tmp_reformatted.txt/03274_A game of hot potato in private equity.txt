A game of hot potato in private equity


The L’Agefi daily edition reports that the private equity unit of Société Générale is being transferred to Crédit Agricole. SGAM AI Private Equity will initially move to CAAM, and will then subsequently become a part of CAPE (Crédit Agricole Private Equity). According to one source close to the firm, cited by the newspaper, “CAAM doesn’t know what to do with SGAM AI PE, which has a lot of people and doesn’t generate much money.”
