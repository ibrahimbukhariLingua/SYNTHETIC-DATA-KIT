Germans not doing much to diversify their fund portfolios


Only 13% of Germans who have invested in shares in funds or equities, and among those who invest in funds, 32% have shares in only one product, and 49% hold shares in only two or three funds, according to a survey by GfK on behalf of Gothaer Asset Management (GoAM), undertaken in January 2012.The study finds that Germans prefer safety (60.9% compared with 45% in 2010), and their favourite vehicle is the savings account (47%, compared with 31%), while 24% prefer sight deposits. But 29% say that they are not in a position to save.Also of note is the fact that among motives for savings, the macroeconomic picture, investment in the countryâ€™s means of production, plays virtually no role.
