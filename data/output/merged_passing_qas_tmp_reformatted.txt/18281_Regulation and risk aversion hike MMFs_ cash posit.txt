Regulation and risk aversion hike MMFs’ cash positions


Since the financial crisis, modifications to US regulations and continuing aversion to risk have led US money market funds to increase liquidity levels in their portfolios significantly, according to a new study by the financial ratings agency Fitch Ratings, published on 14 November.As of the end of September 2012, liquid asset represented a total of 45% of assets, compared with about 20% as of the end of 2006. The study finds that money market funds have increased their liquidity on three occasions in the past few years: firstly, at the outbreak of the financial crisis, particularly following the tensions of August 2007, which affected dedicated vehicles (SIV) and the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market, then following modifications to regulations initiated by the SEC in 2010, and lastly in mid-2011, when volatility in the euro zone began to increase.The market authorities are highly attentive to the capacity for money market funds to bear market shocks, and to “strong and considerable liquidity to meet redemption demand and maintain confidence during periods of volatility,” says Roger Merritt, managing director and head of the Fund and Asset Manager evaluation group at Fitch. The agency adds that it is unlikely that money market funds will maintain such high liquidity cushions for very long, since they eat into returns. As soon as market volatility declines, money market funds will be likely to look for more lucrative investment opportunities.
