UCITS IV could cost jobs at British management firms


Toby Hogbin, head of product development at Martin Currie, says that asset management firms which do not consider the British market their top priority will take the introduction of the UCITS IV directive on 1 July 2011 as an occasion to merge their British and continental product ranges, using a Luxembourg master fund and British feeder funds, Money Marketing reports. This will result in staff reductions in back-office and compliance in the UK.
