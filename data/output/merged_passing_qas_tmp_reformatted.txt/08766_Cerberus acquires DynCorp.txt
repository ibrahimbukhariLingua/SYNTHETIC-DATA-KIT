Cerberus acquires DynCorp


The board of directors at DynCorp International on Monday accepted an acquisition offer from a fund of the private equity investor Cerberus Capital Management, for about USD1.5bn, including debt. Shareholders will receive USD17.55 per share, which represents a premium of about 49% above the closing share price of USD11.75 on 9 April, and slightly over 50% higher than the average closing price over the past 90 days. The acquisition of the defence group will be partly self-financed by Cerberus, which will also contract loans from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup Global Markets, Barclays Bank and Deutsche Bank Securities. The transaction will be completed in third or fourth quarter, but DynCorp will retain the ability to entertain other acquisition offers from third parties for a period of 28 days, with a USD30m charge to cancel the Cerberus deal.
