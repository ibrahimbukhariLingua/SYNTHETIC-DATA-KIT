Hedge funds use satellite images


Hedge fund managers are turning to satellite technology, particularly satellite images, to gain a competitive edge, Financial Times fund management reports. They are using it to monitor exposure to risk in the areas surrounding mines, ports, plantations and farmlands. For example, satellite images can show which of two neighbouring mines produce more coal. Hedge funds also use images to monitor occupancy of parking lots surrounding major shopping centres.
