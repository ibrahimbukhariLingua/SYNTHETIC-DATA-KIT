p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } According to a survey by Accenture and RBC Dexia, outsourcing, particularly of back-office and middle-office, is perceived by asset management players as a structural solution to improve the profitability of proprietary capital in the industry. La Tribune reports that the survey of over 80 fund managers worldwide, entitled “Outsourcing: opportunities and strategies,” finds that 59% of respondents are now predicting an ROE of lower than or equal to 15%, compared with 20% previously. The major cause motivating asset management firms to outsource some of their activities is cost savings, for 95% of respondents, while 77% find that outsourcing is now a trend among funds. In terms of the providers selected, the market leaders, State Street and BNY Mellon, are the most often cited.
