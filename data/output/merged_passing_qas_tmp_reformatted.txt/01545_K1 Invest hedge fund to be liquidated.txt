K1 Invest hedge fund to be liquidated


The director of the K1 hedge fund has assigned Grant Thornton to undertake the liquidation of the K1 Invet hedge fund, which has defaulted, Das Investment reports. The administrator of K1 in Switzerland says that the fund had about EUR348m in assets as of the end of July, but it is not known what proportion of those assets correspond to debt owed to banks. K1 was founded by Michael Kiener, who has been jailed since the end of October, awaiting trial on charges of fraud against Barclays and BNP Paribas amounting to EUR280m.
