BNY Mellon vigorously rejects NY Attorney General’s allegations


In a press release on October, 4th, BNY dismissed the charges in the civil lawsuit filed by the Office of the New York Attorney General according to which the bank would have overcharged its foreign exchange (FX) services to various customers, especially pension funds (see Newsmanagers of October, 5th). It stresses that these claims are «flat out wrong, both on the law and on the facts». It recognizes that capitulating to the Office’s demands might avoid some nasty headlines, but refuses «to be coerced into admitting to and paying for wrongdoing that does not exist».The statement stresses that BNY Mellon executed transactions within fully disclosed, daily guaranteed pricing ranges and that, anyway, the decision to use the company’s FX services rested solely with institutional clients and their investment managers who could opt out on daily basisBNY Mellon also insists ont the fact that these services offer institutional clients and investment managers attractive «cholesale» prices which otherwise would not be available for «retail» size trades. And, finally, the bank says that the lawsuit reflects «inappropriate overreaching into commercial relationships».
