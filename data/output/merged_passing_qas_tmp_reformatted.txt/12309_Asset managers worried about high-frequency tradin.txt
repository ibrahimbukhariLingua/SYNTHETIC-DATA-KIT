Asset managers worried about high-frequency trading


More than two thirds of traders at the world’s largest asset management firms say they are worried about the impact of high-frequency trading (HFT) on the equity markets, according to a survey by Liquidnet.Most long-only traders estimate that high-frequency trading is a negative factor for institutional investors making large trades. According to the founder and chief executive of Liquidnet, Seth Merrin, many investors estimate that a long-term investment strategy contradicts the speculative approach associated with high-frequency trading.“Institutional investors who manage billions of dollars for traditional investors needs to be in a position to take up or liquidate positions in a secure and efficient manner, safe from the retail markets and drivers of internalisation where high-frequency trading prospers, especially in the volatile markets we have observed recently,” Merrin says in a statement.At the five largest institutions in the world, 73% of traders estimate that high-frequency trading represents a structural problem for the markets that urgently needs to be addressed. Two thirds of North American traders say they are concerned about high-frequency trading, compared with 60% of European traders, and slightly over half of traders in the Asia-Pacific region. According to studies by Aite group and Tabb Group, nearly 75% of daily equity trading may be attributed to high-frequency trading.
