BlackRock suffers due to competition from Vanguard


A ferocious price war led by Vanguard has allowed its ETFs to attract net inflows of USD37.8bn in the first 8 months of this year worldwide, and to overtake BlackRock (USD35.3bn), Financial Times Fund Management observes, citing statistics from EFFGI. For ETFs where BlackRock and Vanguard are in competition, Vanguard has captured 71% of new business between July 2009 and July 2012, compared with only 21% for BlackRock, Bernstein says. “BlackRock lost market share for all products for which Vanguard has a similar substitute», says Luke Montgomery, an analyst at Bernstein.
