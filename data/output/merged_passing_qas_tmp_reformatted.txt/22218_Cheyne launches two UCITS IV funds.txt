Cheyne launches two UCITS IV funds


Cheyne Capital Management has announced the launch of two UCITS IV compliant funds: the Cheyne Global Credit Fund and the Cheyne European Real Estate Bond Fund. Their investment portfolios are based on those of two existing flagship Cheyne strategies.The Cheyne Global Credit Fund is an actively managed, directional UCITS IV compliant fund offering weekly liquidity. It positions investment grade and crossover credit, primarily in North America and Europe, where the team believes credit spreads are currently pricing in too much downside given the very robust fundamentals of most corporate balance sheets. Cheyne’s corporate credit team manages net assets of USD1.3 billion. The Cheyne Real Estate Bond Fund is a UCITS IV compliant fund focusing on high quality real estate-backed bonds offering weekly liquidity. Cheyne’s real estate debt team has also net assets under management of USD1.3 billion. The team has identified a compelling investment opportunity arising from the structural dislocation in Europe’s EUR1.4 trillion real estate debt market, offering attractive yields with strong downside protection.
