US ETF market reaches saturation


79% of the 109 ETF funds launched in the United States in the first six months of the year attracted less than USD30m in assets, a profitability threshold for the sector, according to statistics from XTF prepared for the Financial Times. In 2010, the percentage was 62%, and in 2009, it was under 50%. Professionals say the decline in popularity is due to increasing saturation of the market, the FT remarks.
