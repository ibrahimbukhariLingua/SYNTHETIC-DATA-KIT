CalSTRS calls on firms to have responsible policies on management compensation


The California State Teacherâ€™s Retirement System (CalSTRS, USD111.6bn in assets) has called on the 300 largest companies in which it is invested to put in place responsible policies on management compensation, and to allow shareholders to hold advisory votes on these policies. The goal is to reward long-term thinking and improve pay-for-performance practices while deterring excessive risk taking.
