Change in managers for a Scottish Widows small caps fund


Scottish Widows has decided to entrust the management of the Scottish Widows HIFML UK Smaller Companies Alpha fund to an in-house team. As a result, the fund, which had previously been managed by Harry Nimmo, the small caps specialist at Standard Life Investments, will now be managed by two members of the SWIP equities team, Gregor Macdonald and Andrew Paisley. They are also responsible for the management of the SWIP UK Smaller Companies fund and the SW UK Smaller Companies fund. At Standard Life Investments, Nimmo manages the SLI UK Smaller Companies fund, whose assets under management total GBP1bn, the Standard Life UK Smaller Companies trust (GBP140m), and the SLI Global Smaller Companies fund, which has recently been created.
