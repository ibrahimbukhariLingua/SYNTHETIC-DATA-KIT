The great rotation remains elusive


It is certain: since the beginning of the year, the great turnover to equities has not yet taken place, and bonds remain the preferred asset class for investors. In the week to 8 February, the rebounding inflationary scenario does remain advantageous for equity funds, but a rebound in bond returns has incited investors to prefer exposure to the bond asset class, both to traditional and to more high-riak assets such as high yield and emerging market debt.Bond funds attracted USD13.3bn in the past week, for their seventh consecutive week of net inflows, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch weekly survey, based on data from the global flow evolution monitoring specialist EPFR Global. All of the major categories of bonds saw positive inflows. High yield strategies took in USD1.9bn, while emerging market debt funds posted net inflows of USD2.5bn. With net inflows of USD1.2bn, loan funds have seen 13 consecutive weeks of positive net inflows. Inflation-linked bond funds, for their part, have seen nine weeks of net inflows, totalling USD1bn. Last but not least, investment grade bond funds have seen net inflows of USD7.6bn.For equities, the subs are less spectacular, but the trend remains positive over six weeks, with net inflows in the last period of USD6.3bn. Inflows to European equity funds remain very timid, at USD0.1bn. However, emerging market equity funds and Japanese equity funds have seen net inflows of USD1bn and USD3.4bn, respectively. However, defiance of US equities remains strong, as funds dedicated to US equities have seen net outflows of USD1.6bn.
