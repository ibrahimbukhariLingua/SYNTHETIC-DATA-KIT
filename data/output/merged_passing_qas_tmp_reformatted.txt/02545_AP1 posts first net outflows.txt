AP1 posts first net outflows


As of the end of June, assets in the pension fund Första AP-fonden (AP1) totalled SEK181.4bn, which represents an increase of SEK9.8bn compared with 31 December, though net investment income totalled SEK11.5bn, a net performance of 6.7%, compared with losses of 8%. This difference is due to the fact that AP1 has seen net outflows for the first time, of SEK1.7bn, largely due to the retirement of employees of the “baby boom” generation.AP1 says in its half-yearly report that it has altered its asset management model, and now prefers an absolute returns formula to an active management policy. Before fees, performance of listed assets totalled 7.5%, while the alternative allocation lost 4.4% (or SEK400m), largely due to a depreciation of 6% in the value of real estate assets.
