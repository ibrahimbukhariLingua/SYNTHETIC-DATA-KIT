Axa IM freezes subscriptions as well for Immoselect fund


The German management firm Axa Investment Managers Deutschland on 27 April announced that it is actively preparing to reopen its open-ended real estate fund Axa Immoselect (DE0009846451, EUR2.61586bn in assets), for which redemptions have been frozen since 17 November 2009. The objective is to first reach 30% liquidity before reopening redemptions, says Achim Gr√¢fen, CEO of Axa IM Deutschland.In order to achieve that, the fund will continue to sell off assets, which appears to be easier now that sale prices are more attractive in several markets where the Immoselect fund is invested. The fund manager says it has also suspended subscriptions, effective from 27 April at 11:30 AM.
