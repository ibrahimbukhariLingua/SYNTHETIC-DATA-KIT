ING IM France aims for EUR5bn in assets under management


It has been a very good year for ING IM France. Net inflows at the firm, which nearly a year ago became the French arm of ING IM Europe, in the first 11 months of the year totalled about EUR350m, the director of ING IM France, Thierry Rigoulet, told Newsmanagers on 7 December. Assets under management, which as of the end of 2008 had fallen to EUR1bn, now total EUR2.7bn.The current environment is not the most promising ever, says Rigoulet. “We are in an arbitrage and replacement market, rather than an equipment market,” he says. However, the flagship funds from ING IM have still managed to make a large contribution to performance.The high dividend US equities strategy has attracted net inflows of EUR110m in France, out of total net inflows of EUR200m. With the help of positive market effects, assets in the fund have increased from EUR250m at the end of 2009 to EUR500m as of the end of November.A similar trend may be observed for emerging markets fixed income, for funds in local currencies (about EUR1bn) and hard currency (also about EUR1bn). Net inflows in France totalled over EUR200m, of which EUR150m went to funds in local currencies, and EUR70m to other funds.Rigoulet is not planning to let up when things are going so well. The objective is to increase total assets under management to EUR5bn in the next three years. With this in mind, several mandates are in the gestation phase, particularly for high yield strategies. “There are also a lot of businesses which are planning to outsource the managemement of their social liabilities,” says Rigoulet, who with the extension of the range and calls for proposals, foresees sustained activity in the early months of 2011.
