Manulife plans to develop in Hong Kong


The Canadian firm Manulife is seeking to sell its products on Hong Kong banking platforms, Asian Investor reports. Manulife has already signed distribution agreements with banks in the territory, including Bank of China and Bank of East Asia, but would also like to be featured on the platforms of other major actors in the region, such as Citi, HSBC and Standard Chartered. The firm has also announced that Myles Morin, vice president and head of investment funds at Manulife Hong Kong, will be leaving the territory in mid-July to deploy a similar development strategy for distribution channels in Canada.
