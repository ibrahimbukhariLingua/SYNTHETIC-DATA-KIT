Entheca Finance launches a fund dedicated to European equities


Entheca Finance on 10 May announced the launch of the FCP Entheca Top European Manager, whose creation was reported by Newsmanagers earlier this year (12 January 2011). The new fund, which is eligible for PEA tax status, is exposed to European equities via investment in OPCVM mutual fund shares (up to 100% of net assets). The fund uses an original approach, which involves selecting exclusively mutual funds from entrepreneurial and independent management firms, meaning those firms which are not majority owned affiliates of institutional financial groups. The investment strategy is the result of two observations: on equities markets, the past decade was a “lost decade” for investors in index-based management. However, it was a partticularly strong period for investors in active and diversified management, due to the contribution of small and midcaps. The Entheca Top European Manager fund will select conviction-based managers, whose stock-picking on the basis of capitalisation size (small, medium and large caps) and management style (growth, value, returns) allows them to outperform the major indices over a complete market cycle. The fund aims for higher returns than the MSCI Europe index, over a minimal investment duration of 7 years.
