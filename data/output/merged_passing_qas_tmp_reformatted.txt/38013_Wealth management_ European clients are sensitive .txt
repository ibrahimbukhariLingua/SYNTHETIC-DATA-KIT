According to a recent study published by SEI, Scorpiopartnership and NPG Wealth Management of more than 3,000 ultra-high net worth clients, with an average of USD2.9m, performance is a determining criterion in this loyalty. It is the criterion cite by 17% of respondents worldwide. This is particularly true in the Americas (24%), but less so in Asia (13%) and Europe (14%). Asian clients are more sensitive to investment services and solutions which are adapted to their needs. In Europe, the main criterion which determines the fidelity of private clients is satisfaction with the advising obtained from the adviser, for 17%. The study finds that the higher a clientâ€™s net worth is, the less performance becomes a predominant criterion, Clients with over USD4m in assets to invest are more sensitive to personalised investment services and solutions than financial performance, which is the top criterion for clients with EUR500,000 to invest.
