Carmignac posts outflows of EUR650m in third quarter


High exposure to emerging markets at Carmignac naturally had its cost this summer. The asset management firm yesterday explained its investment strategy, and announced that in third quarter, it had posted outflows of EUR650m, representing 1.1% of its overall assets, for a total of EUR52.3bn as of the end of September. Didier Saint Georges, a member of the investment board and managing directors, put the setback in perspective with the observation that since the beginning of the year, inflows to the firm remain positive to the tune of EUR2.2bn. However, “despite difficulties in the investment region, emerging markte equity funds of the range show positive returns since the beginning of the year.”The head confirms that the firm’s “attachment” th emerging markets is a part of a planned rise of a new equity fund investing in China as pat of its range. The fund, creaated by the lab in October 2014, is the “youngest child” of the Carmignac range of funds, and is currently only registered in Luxembourg. But other registrations are already planned in other countries. “And the fund, which has exposure to the A class equity markte via a RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quota received by the company, is performing well,” Saint Georges added.
