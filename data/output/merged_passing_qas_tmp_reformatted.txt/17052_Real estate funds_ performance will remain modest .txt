Real estate funds: performance will remain modest in 2011


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } According to a Handelsblatt survey of Commerz Real, Deka Immobilien, RREEF (Deutsche Bank) and Union Investment Real Estate (UIRE), with a total of EUR52bn in assets for their real estate open-ended funds, a major increase in performance compared with 2010 is not to be expected in 2011. Gains as of the end of November varied from 1.3% for Westinvest (Deka) to 3.3% for the hausInvest fund from Commerz Real, well below the usual 4% to 5%. This is due to high levels of liquidity, at 20% to 34% for UIRE, and 20% for funds from RREEF and Deka, which reduces performance. The hausInvest fund has only 15% cash, which boosted returns.Some real estate funds are seeking to reduce their liquidity by investing, but the competition drives up the prices of good quality commercial properties. UIRE was therefore not able to spend all of its investment budget of EUR1.2bn for 2010, and RREEF is expecting only EUR500m in investments this year, compared with EUR800m last year.Net subscriptions in 2010 are estimated to have totalled over EUR1bn at RREEF and Deka, and EUR1.5bn at UIRE, but hausInvest saw net outflows of EUR1.4bn in January-November.
