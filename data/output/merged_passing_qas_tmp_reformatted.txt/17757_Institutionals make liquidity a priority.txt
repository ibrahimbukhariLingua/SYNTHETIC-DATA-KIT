Institutionals make liquidity a priority


Institutional asset owners are reconsidering their asset allocation strategies, in the wake of ongoing volatility on international financial markets, which has highlighted deficiencies in investment portfolios. “In their allocation decisions, many asset holders are now targeting liquidity as a priority, and they are reconsidering their management approach from this perspective,” says Dan Farley, senior managing director at SSgA and global director of the investment solutions division at the asset management firm, at a presentation of a Vision report. The report, entitled “The Asset Owners’ Perspective: Evolving Investment and Operational Models,” attached, explains that investors are relying on new liquidity management approaches ot modify the composition of their portfolios, to reconcile the two imperatives of liquidity and returns. Among the foremost measures taken by asset owners in order to offset the liquidity crisis are tougher stress tests. In terms of allocation, 39% of corporate retirement plans which participated in the SSgA study are planning to increase their allocation to investment grade corporate credit, and 30% of public retirement regimes are planning to include emerging markets in their allocation next year. 45% of asset owners also note that low returns on traditional assets have generated increased interest at their organisation in alternative products.
