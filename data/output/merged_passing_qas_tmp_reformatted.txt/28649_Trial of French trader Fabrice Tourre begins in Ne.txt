Trial of French trader Fabrice Tourre begins in New York


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The trial of French trader Fabricee Tourre, a former employee of Goldman Sachs, begins today in New York, Les Echos reports. The financier in 2007 created Abacus, a complex product, largely consisting of real estate securities. He crisscrossed Europe to sell the product to clients, and meanwhile teamed up with billionaire John Paulson to play the same product for a loss. The stratagem brought in USD1bn in capital gains for Paulson, and USD2bn in bonuses for Tourre. Investors, for their part, lost USD1bn. Tourre, who has left Goldman Sachs, unlike the bank, has refused all out-of-court settlements with the market authority. This would have involved a lifetime ban on practising in finance.
