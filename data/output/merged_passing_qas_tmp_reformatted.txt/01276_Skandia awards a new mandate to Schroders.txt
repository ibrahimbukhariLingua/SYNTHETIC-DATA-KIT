Skandia awards a new mandate to Schroders


Skandia Investment Group (SIG) has awarded a GBP150m mandate to Richard Buxton, head of the British equities team at Schroders, following the groupâ€™s decision to withdraw the mandate previously entrusted to Origin Asset Management. The mandate covers a portion of the UK equities in the UK Equity Blend Fund, the GBP280m Skandia Diversified Fund, and six Spectrum funds which have grown to asset volumes totalling GBP350m since their launch in April 2008. The UK equities team at Schroders already has three mandates on SIG funds: Skandia Global Best Ideas Fund, Skandia UK Best Ideas Fund, and Skandia Global Dynamic Equity Fund.
