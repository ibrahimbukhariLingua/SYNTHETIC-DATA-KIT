Asset managers facing pressure on commissions more than ever


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Among the challenges which asset managers worldwide are going to need to face is downward pressure on commissions, Cerulli Associates points out in the latest edition of its publication “Cerulli Edge – Global Edition.” “In Europe, like in the rest of the world, downward pressure on commissions, driven by passive management comparisons which platforms make possible, and regulators, will not be reduced in 2016. Managers are responding, for example, with decisions by partisans of active management to move into ETFs. Other examples include diversification and the acquisition/creation of platforms and capacities in financial technologies (“fintech”)”, Barbara Wall, managing director of the European office of Cerulli Associates, explains. Europe only represents 18% of the global ETF market, compared with 70% for the United States, but Barbara Wall estimates that things are changing. European clients increasingly know ETF vehicles well, particularly in the mass affluent segment. Platforms from major asset management groups such as Fideity offer ETFs from top players such as Vanguard, HSBC and iShares. Some players, such as the online wealth management firm Nutmeg, also contribute to recognition of ETFs among retail clients. However, European asset management firms have at least one reason to be glad, to the extent that the migration of insurance companies to unit-linked products represents a real opportunity. Cerulli estimates that growing demand for multi-asset class funds should be exploited. Institutional investors have a tendency to group together to implement their investment policies, which allows them to reduce costs, since they use fewer external managers or engage their services entirely.
