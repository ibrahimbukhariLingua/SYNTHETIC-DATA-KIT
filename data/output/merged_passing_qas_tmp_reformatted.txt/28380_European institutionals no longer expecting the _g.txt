European institutionals no longer expecting the “great rotation”


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } A survey undertaken in June of 165 European institutional investors by Aquila Capital has found that 54% of professionals surveyed think that the famous “great rotation,” the massive migration from investments from bonds to equities, will not take place. One third of institutional investors are planning to maintain their current allocation to bonds, and 29% are planning to increase it.According to Oldrik Verloop, director of Aquila Capital, institutional investors are planning to maintain their exposure to bonds, even in a difficult environment. Two thirds of respondents consider the current context challenging to very challenging, while three fifths estimate that it is difficult to very difficult to generate positive results at this stage in the interest rate cycle. The primary challenges cited are the potential for an increase in interest rates, the low interest rate environment, and the means to obtain adequate diversification as well as solvency risks and the danger of inflation. Nearly three quarters of respondents estimate that it would be difficult or very difficult to make predictions about the evolution of interest rates over the next three years. This clearly incites a search for replacement solutions, and 44% of institutionals surveyed say they are planning to adopt risk parity strategies for their bond allocations.
