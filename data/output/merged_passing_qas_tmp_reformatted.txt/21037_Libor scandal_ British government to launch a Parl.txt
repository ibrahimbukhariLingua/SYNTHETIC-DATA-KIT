Libor scandal: British government to launch a Parliamentary enquiry


Following the resignation of the chairman of the board at Barclays, Marcus Agiu, the British government has announced a series of investigations and legal changes in the wake of manipulations of the Libor inter-bank interest rate by the bank and several others, Les Echos reports. The British prime minister, David Cameron, has announced a Parliamentary investigation into banking practices, which will be led by the head of the Treasury commission, Andrew Tyrie. The United Kingdom should have “tougher and more transparent regulations of all the major financial sectors,” Cameron says. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, has also announced an enquiry into the functioning of the Libor.
