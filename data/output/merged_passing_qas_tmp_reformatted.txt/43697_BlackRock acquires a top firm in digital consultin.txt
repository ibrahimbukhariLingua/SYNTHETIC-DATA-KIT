p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } BlackRock Inc on 26 August announced that it has signed a final agreement to acquire the financial technologies firm FutureAdvisor, based in San Francisco, a specialist in digital consulting and management in the wealth management sector. FutureAdvisor will be integrated as a complete activity into the BlackRock Solutions (BRS) management platform, which will thus be better able to assist financial institutions (banks, insurers, broker-dealers) seeking a digital consulting platform which may be disposed to make client loyalty and growth in assets under management more likely. According to a statement, the move aims to meet strong demand from generation Y, children of the millennium, a segment which represents about 30% of investable assets in the United States. FutureAdvisor presents itself as a specialist in digital wealth management, which, through new technologies, has developed a complete range of services, such as personalised advising, which gives an overview of all components of a client portfolio, efficient portfolio management from a fiscal perspective, internet or mobile applications, and multi-customdian assistance. From its site, BlackRock will contribute multi-asset class reference portfolios, sophisticated investment products, and solutions developed by BlackRock Solutions. The transaction is expected to be completed during fourth quarter 2015.
