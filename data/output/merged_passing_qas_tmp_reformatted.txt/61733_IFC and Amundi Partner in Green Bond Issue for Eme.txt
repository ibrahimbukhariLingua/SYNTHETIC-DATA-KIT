IFC and Amundi Partner in Green Bond Issue for Emerging Markets


On the sidelines of the Spring Meetings of the World Bank, which were held in Washington from 21 to 23 April, Amundi formed a strategic partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a leading global institution for development assistance, whose activities focus solely on the private sector in developing countries. This partnership, concluded at the end of a competitive process between 16 global asset managers, will take the form of a new joint venture owned 80% by Amundi. The newly-formed entity will successively launch several bond funds in emerging countries.
