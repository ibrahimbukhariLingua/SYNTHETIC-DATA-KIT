Philippe Marchessaux (BNP Paribas IP) does not rule out further acquisitions


“Fortis is a great opportunity because it is complementary to our business», said Philippe Marchessaux, newly installed head of BNP Paribas Investment Partners and chief executive of BNP Paribas Asset Management in an interview with Financial Times Fund Management. He does not rule out further acquisitions if the right business comes up for sale although it would be smaller than the Fortis deal.
