High yield fund in difficulty in China


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In the province of Shanxi, 500â€¯km south-west of Beijing, Chinese savings investors yesterday demonstrated in front of a branch of China Construction Bank (CCB), seeking a reimbursement of their investments in a high yield vehicle sold by the bank. The product, entitled Songhuajiang River No. 77, with assets totalling USD156m (about CNY1bn) has excited the defiance of subscribers, who did not receive the level of returns expected, and, still more worrying, who did not get their initial money back. The troubles revives concerns which are currently playing on the Chinese trust industry, which has a total weight of USD1.75trn. In January this year, a product sold by Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd to raise funds to help a troubled mining firm had to be bailed out in order to prevent it from becoming what would then have been the first default of a Chinese trust in over 10 years.
