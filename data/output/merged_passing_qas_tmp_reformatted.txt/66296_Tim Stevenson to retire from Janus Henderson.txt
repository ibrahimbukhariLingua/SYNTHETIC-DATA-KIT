Tim Stevenson to retire from Janus Henderson


It is the end of an era: after 32 years at Janus Henderson Investors, Tim Stevenson, director of pan-European equities, has decided to retire at the end of first quarter 2019, the asset management firm has announced. Stevenson will remain as part of the team to ensure a smooth transition. Stevenson is a veteran at Henderson, which he joined in 1986. As a result of his decision, Janus Henderson Investors has appointed James Ross as the sole manager of the Janus Henderson Horizon Pan European Equity fund. Ross had previously been co-manager, and has been working closely with Stevenson to manage pan-European equity portfolios since August 2016. Ross has been a member of the European equity team for several years, after serving as a British equity fund manager. He has 11 years of experience in the asset management sector. p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; }
