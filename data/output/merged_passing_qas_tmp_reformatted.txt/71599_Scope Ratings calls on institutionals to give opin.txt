Scope Ratings calls on institutionals to give opinions on ratings


The ratings agency Scope Ratings on 22 February announced an original initiative. In the interests of improving transparency and interactivity in the evaluation process, the young ratings agency is inviting institutional investors to offer their analytical points of view with respect to the rated issuers. The initiative, entitled Investor Analytical Feedback (IAF), represents a major first step toward “breaking the mould” of the modus operandi of the major ratings agencies, says Scope.IAF mainly represents a special analytical survey of issuers, seeking simple and direct answers from investors. According to Scope, this periodical call for analysis of ratings may potentially reduce concerns on the part of investors about the pricing model at agencies (“the issuer pays”), by adding the contrasting perspective of the investor.
