AIFM: Deutsche Bank calls for an integrated model


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } One of the key points at the introduction of the European hedge fund directive (AIFMD) will be the importance which devolves upon the depository in the decision-making process for fund managers. The text aims to provide a solution which protects investors, and, in a study, Deutsche Bank claims that an integrated model would better serve those ends and be less costly for the manager, as Mike Hughes, global head, fund services in the global transaction banking unit at Deutshe Bank, points out.The author says that in his opinion the service provided to hedge fund managers will be of a higher quality when they work with depository teams which are able to work with all their prime brokers, and that can also act as fund administrators, cash managers, transfer agents, and sub-custodians within a framework of appropriate “Chinese walls” and segregation of duties.”Deutsche Bank has also announced that it is holding an event dedicated to AIFMD in Dublin on 22 July, the day that the directive comes into force.
