DWS Invest bullish on natural gas


Pierre Martin is the manager of the DWS Invest Commodity Plus fund, which invests directly in commodities via futures. He is optimistic about the mid-term outlooks for the commodities sector, L’Echo reports. “Although he thinks that reserves of some commodities are too high (such as oil, for example), a drastic reduction in supply (mines, OPEC) will stabilise the commodities markets, or send them rising again in the next few quarters,” the newspaper adds. The manager’s favourite market is currently North American natural gas.
