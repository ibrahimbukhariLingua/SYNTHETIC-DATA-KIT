Tobias Schmidt (Feri EuroRating): “We want to develop our activities in France”


In an interview with La Tribune, Tobias Schmidt, president of Feri EuroRating, describes the structure of his firm and lays out its ambitions in Europe. The wholly-owned subsidiary of Feri AG does not sell investment products, and in relation to ratings for sovereign debt issuers, “our economic model is based solely on remuneration from investors for our services,” he says. The structure has offices in London, Paris and New York. “Our ambition is to develop our presence abroad, particularly in France. Currently, our activities in Paris are largely focused on database activities, but we are planning to develop ratings there. Eventually recruitments are conceivable,” says Schmidt.
