Head of Metacapital predicts more hedge fund closures this year


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The horizon is darkening for the hedge fund industry. Deepak Narula, the founder of the hedge fund Metacapital Management, expects to see more closures of hedge funds this year, stating that there is too much money under management and not enough good ideas, the news agency Bloomberg reports. “When you look at the growth that the hedge fund industry has undergone and the volume of money managed by managers, it is difficult to have ideas that generate alpha,” he tells Bloomberg. In fact, since the beginning of the year, hedge funds with over USD16bn in assets under management have already announced closures of funds, such as the liquidation of macro funds from Fortress Investment and Bain Capital. These closures come at a time when the industry, which has USD2.9trn in assets under management worldwide, earned average returns of 0.7% in the first nine months of 2015, according to statistics compiled by Bloomberg.
