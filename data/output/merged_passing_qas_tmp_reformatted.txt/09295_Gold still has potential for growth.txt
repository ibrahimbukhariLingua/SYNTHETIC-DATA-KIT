Gold still has potential for growth


In an interview with Les Echos, the president and CEO of Barrick Gold, Aaron Regent, says that teh price of gold still has potential to rise, as the exposure of central banks to the US dollar is considered excessive and in need of rebalancing. “The sovereign debt crisis is an added incitement to diversify assets, and in so doing to invest sustainably in gold,” says Regent.
