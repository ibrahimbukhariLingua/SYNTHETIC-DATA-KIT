Basel III not in doubt


The failure of the European Union and the United States to respect the deadline of 1 January 2013 to apply new banking solvency rules does not raise doubts about the Basel III agreement, regulators have announced.The Basel commission on 14 December announced, following a two-day meeting, that 11 countries are prepared to begin applying the new rules. “We are expecting regulations to be finalised in other jurisdictions during 2013, and they will join all other interim deadlines, under the initial agreement,” the chairman of the commission, Stefan Ingves, said in a statement. He says that this will be the case even if the parties concerned are not able to implement the rules in early 2013 as planned.“As a result, by the end of 2013, nearly all jurisdictions of the Basel commission will apply Basel III, in line with the calendar defined,” Ingves, who is also governor of the Swedish central bank, adds. “This is an absolutely crucial move to strengthen the global banking system.”
