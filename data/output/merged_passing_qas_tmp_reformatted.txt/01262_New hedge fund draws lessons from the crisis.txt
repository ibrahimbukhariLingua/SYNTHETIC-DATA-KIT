New hedge fund draws lessons from the crisis


Les Echos reports that Northlight, a hedge fund launched this week by three former Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and GLG Partners managers, will seek to bring the interests of incoming and outgoing investors into line, to avoid panic when the markets are nervous. Its commissions are lower than the industry average. The fund will be invested in European high yield credit markets, and will start out with USD50m in assets. It will aim for USD300m-USD500m when it reaches full size. The test will come when the structure confronts market turbulence.
