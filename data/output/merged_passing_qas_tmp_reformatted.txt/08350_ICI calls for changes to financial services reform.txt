ICI calls for changes to financial services reform bill


On Friday, the Investment Company Institute (ICI) published a position paper welcoming the passage by the US Senate of the financial services reform bill. However, the management firm association claims that the text still needs to be improved in order to avoid disadvantaging mutual funds (which manage USD12trn on behalf of 90 million subscribers). The association claims passages which subject mutual funds to impractical banking regulations should be removed, and that changes should be introduced to dissipate fears that mutual funds which hold debts issued by non-banking financial sector firms that undergo a liquidation ordered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) would be treated differently than other shareholders with the same status, and that financial contracts such as repos would not be immediately executable.
