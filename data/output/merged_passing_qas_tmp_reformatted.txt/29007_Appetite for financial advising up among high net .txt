Appetite for financial advising up among high net worth clients


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Seven high net worth investors out of ten estimate that financial markets are currently too complicated not to rely on the assistance of an advisor, according to a survey by Charles Schwab. One third of respondents to the survey say that their demand for financial advising increased in the past twelve months, and three quarters say that they are much more confident when they take an investment decision with the help of a professional. Trust and transparency are at the heart of relationships between high net worth clients and advisers. But the survey finds that 72% of respondents trust individual finance specialists, while only 42% put their trust in financial services companies.
