Gender inequality persists in asset management


Les Echos reports that funds managed by women are smaller in average size than those managed by men, with a 1 to 2 ratio. This inequality has no justification (ability, experience), and can be observed in four countries (United States, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy), according to a study by Olaf HÃ¼bler and Lukas Menkhoff, researchers at Leibniz university in Hanover. The inequality is only observed at major management firms, and particularly in their ranges of smaller funds. Once a fund has a certain volume in assets under management, the inequality attenuates. Small management firms and boutiques, for their part, do not appear to be inclined to discriminate on the basis of sex.
