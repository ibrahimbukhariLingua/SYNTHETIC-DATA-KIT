Vanguard reopens an Oaktree Capital fund to new subscribers


The Vanguard Convertible Securities Fund (VCVSX), with assets of USD1.8bn as of 30 April, has been reopened to subscriptions from new retail investors, with immediate effect. The US-based asset management firm says that a previous limit of USD25,000 per year in subscriptions has also been repealed. The limitations which have been lifted from the fund were put in place in June 2009, as the Los Angeles management firm Oaktree Capital, the firm which has advised the fund since 1996, was concerned that a large volume of subscriptions would prevent effective management of the fund. Inflows to the fund have since declined. Vanguard states that six of its funds remain closed to new investors: Vanguard PRIMECAP Fund, PRIMECAP Core Fund, Capital Opportunity Fund, Capital Value Fund, Admiralâ„¢ Treasury Money Market Fund and Federal Money Market Fund.
