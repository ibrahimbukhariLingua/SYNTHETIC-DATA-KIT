Suitors line up for Robeco


The asset management affiliate of Rabobank, Robeco, appears to be generating some strong interest, Agefi reports. Since April, offers to acquire the firm have been flooding in. According to the Netherlands newspaper Het Financieele Tagblad, several dozen potential acquirers have expressed interest. Among these are private equity funds from outside the euro zone, including the British (widely international) funds CVC Capital Partners and Apax Partners, and the US firm Hellman & Friedman. Buyers in continental Europe are less interested, Agefi reports.
