Robeco in Asian push


The Netherlands-based Robeco group is launching a new offensive in Asia, where it has signed several distribution agreements, institutional mandates, and advising partnerships in recent months. Asian Investor reports that the Robeco Teda Sustainable Private Equity Fund was granted a sales license in December, and the firm has also been granted a license by the National Development and Reform Commission (NSRC), which makes the fund eligible to be selected by insurers, pension funds and Chinese government funds. The Robeco fund is the only product dedicated to clean technologies and sustainable development to have been approved by the commission. Robeco has also made inroads in Taiwan, where it is expecting final agreement from the authorities to distribute its funds.
