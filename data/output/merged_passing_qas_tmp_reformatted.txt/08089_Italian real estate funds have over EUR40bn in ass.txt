Italian real estate funds have over EUR40bn in assets


At the end of 2009, there were 270 real estate funds in Italy, compared with 29 in 2004, with assets of EUR40.6bn, Il Sole – 24 Ore reports, citing a study by Scenari Immobiliari (“I fondi immobiliari in Italia e all’estero”). This makes the industry in Italy the third-largest in Europe, after Germany and the Netherlands. Scenari Immobiliari estimates that in 10 years, the Italian real estate fund industry will be the largest in Europe by volume, but that it will have different characteristics. Consolidation is expected in this sector.
