Novethic issues its SRI labels for French funds


In 2011, 156 funds out of 184 applicants obtained the Novethic SRI label, which aims to provide a benchmark for individual investors. Last year, 142 funds out of 182 received the distinction, and in 2009, in the first year of the label, 92 out of 121 were granted it. “The label now has reached critical size,” says Dominic Blanc, head of research at Novethic. It now covers half of the market, as the number of SRI funds in France as of the end of June 2011 was 307, with assets of EUR47bn. Seven asset management firms and 20% of funds were candidates for the label for the first time in 2011, including products from Sycomore Asset Management and La Financière de l’Echiquier. And among those which were granted the label, 65 funds have had it for three years. However, 15 funds, whose names have not been disclosed, lost their labels in 2011. “These are often from firms which had a stagnant SRI range,” says Blanc. Although asset management firms appear to have widely adopted the label, what do the retail investors for whom the label was created think of it? According to Novethic, inflows to funds with an SRI label (in 2010) remained positive in the first half of 2011, at EUR587m, though this was largely due to the weight of money market funds in this category. Equity funds bearing the SRI label saw net redemptions of EUR253m, But Anne-Catherine Husson-Traore, CEO of Novethic, points out that the label is developing in a difficult overall context for financial management. She also notes that there is an increasing and encouraging presence of the SRI label on the funds on the websites of retail networks of banks.
