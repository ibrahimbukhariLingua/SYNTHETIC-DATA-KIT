France - Patrick Savadoux joins Mandarine Gestion


Patrick Savadoux has joined Mandarine Gestion, the asset management company launched nearly a year ago by Marc Renaud, as a shareholder and equities manager. He will develop the firm’s product range in SRI (socially responsible investment), his area of expertise. Savadoux spent 15 years at Natixis Asset Management as a senior European equities portfolio manager and head of the SRI unit. In November 2007, he left the firm along with Stéphane Prévost to create La Financière Responsable, an asset management company specialised in SRI and partly owned by La Française des Placements. He left that firm one year later to pursue a project outside of finance, which was not ultimately successful.Savadoux’s first fund at Mandarine Gestion will be launched in January. It will invest in Euro zone equities following an SRI approach developed by the manager over the course of his career. The manager will rely on Vigeo, and is hoping to subsequently establish internal SRI research resources. Other products may follow, including thematic or solidaristic SRI funds.With the new addition, Mandarine increases its team of specialised managers and its product offerings, which already include value management, convertible bond management, and French equities management. The firm manages assets of EUR300m.
