The assets currently in the portfolio are valued at over USD2bn. However, Santander, PSP Investments and OTPP have announced plans to invest a significant additional amount of new money into the new company thus created over the next five years. The Santander portfolio includes infrastructure assets related to the wind, solar and water sector, located in seven countries. It is and will be managed by a team led by Marcos Sebares. The transaction, whose conditions and price have not been disclosed, is expected to be completed during the first half of 2015, subject to approval from the regulatory authorities.
