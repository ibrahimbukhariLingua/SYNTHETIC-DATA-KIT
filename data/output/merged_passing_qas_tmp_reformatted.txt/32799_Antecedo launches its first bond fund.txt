Kay-Peter Jones, founder of Antecedo Asset Management (EUR500m), is the manager of the first bond fund from the firm, the Antecedo Euro Yield, launched on 20 December. The product invests most of its portfolio in securities from the best issuer with the same residual duration as the benchmark index, the iBoxx Averall AAA-AA TR (government bonds, Pfandbriefe, and corporate bonds).Outperformance is expected to originate from an options trading strategy which involves purchasing long call and put options and simultaneous sales of short-term call and put options on highly liquid publicly-traded securities (futures on Bunds, Bobl and US Treasurys).The objective is to systematically generate outperformance of the benchmark index of 2 percentage points per year.CharacteristicsName: Antecedo Euro YoeldISIN code: DE000A1J6B01Initial price of shares: EUR100Management commission: 0.47%Performance commission: 15% of performance exceeding the iBoxx â‚¬ AAA-AA TR with high watermark.
