Aviva Investors campaigns for more radical SRI


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } “Our team of 17 people, including 7 analysts and 7 fund managers, in addition to 6 corporate governance specialists, manages funds and mandates worth about GBP4bn. This could give you an inaccurate idea of the weight that we might pull at Aviva Investors, which has GBP250bn in assets overall.” Steve Waygood, head of sustainable development and engagement, tells Newsmanagers that the influence of the SRI team is proportionately far higher than its assets under management: “for example, when we decide to vote against a resolution at a general shareholders’ meeting, I vote for all of Aviva Investors. But, of course, this never happens at the companies where our SRI funds invest, since those companies [where we have to vote against resolutions] are a priori excluded from our portfolios.”Aviva Investors, which publishes details of its votes at general shareholders’ meetings, but not the motivations for those votes, on 30 September adopted the Stewardship Code, which is the equivalent for British institutional investors of the governance code for publicly-traded businesses. The text, a “comply or explain” type document from the self-regulating body Financial Reporting Council (FRC), comes into force in 2011, and is on a strictly voluntary basis, with no legal obligation. “It is a very good initiative, whether or not we achieve the necessary critical mass among institutional investors and their management firms. But it has two major deficiencies, which are related. On the one hand, it has no single document which would allow comparisons, and on the other, it does not allow for formal feedback on the part of clients, who are confronted with a multitude of disparate documents at various operators.”
