Patrizia Immobilien acquires British firm Rockspring Property IM


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Patrizia Immobilien is continuing to undertake external growth. One month after acquiring Triuva and SPI in October, the German real estate management specialist on 19 December announced that it is acquiring the British firm Rockspring Property Investment Managers. The operation will give the firm a management centre based in London, with a focus on discretionary capital on behalf of international clients. “This acquisition will further strengthen the base of international investors at Patrizia, and develop the pan-European network of offices, resources and capacities at the group,” a statement says. With the acquisition of Triuva, the German group increased its assets under management from EUR21bn to ERUR30bn. The new operation will increase assets to about EUR40bn. Rockspring has 110 employees in seven offices in Europe. 35% of assets under management are based in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with 34% in Germany, 13% in France, and the remaining 19% in the rest of Europe. Among institutional investors (80% of them pension funds), Rockspring counts 31% originating from the United Kingdom, 27% from the Asia-Pacific region, 5% from North America, and 37% from Continental Europe. This means that Rockspring represents a meaningful addition in terms of clients, as the majority of clients at Patrizia are based in Germany. The financial terms of the operation, and its impact on accounts, will be detailed in first quarter 2018, at a presentation of annual results for the group. The transaction is expected to be completed at the end of first quarter 2018.
