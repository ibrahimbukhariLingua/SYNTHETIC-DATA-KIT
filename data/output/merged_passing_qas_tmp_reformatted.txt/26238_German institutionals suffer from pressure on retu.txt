German institutionals suffer from pressure on returns


According to an annual survey by Union Investment of 104 German institutional investors, more than two thirds of heads surveyed feel that it is important not to have returns below a given level, 8 points higher than in 2012. Meanwhile, 89% of respondents feel that regulatory obstacles reduce their room to manoeuvre and their capacity to outperform, 5 points more than in 2012, and 15 more than in 2011.Currently, German institutionals are 61% invested in bonds and 11% in money markets (compared with 23% in 2012), while their exposure to equities is limited to 5%. Allocation to alternative investments, for its part, has increased to 18%, from 10% last year.The priorities also have changed: avoiding losses is “extremely important” or “very important” for 82% of respondents, compared with 92% in 2012, but care to achieve a given minimal return has become “particularly important” for 64% of respondents, compared with 55% last year, which shows that pressure on returns has increased. Only 18% of investors, however, now feel that it is “important” to avoid underperformance compared with an index, down from 32% in 2012.
