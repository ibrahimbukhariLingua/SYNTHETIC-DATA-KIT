Regulations threaten growth


The head of the China Investment Corporation (CIC), Jin Liquin, is not mincing his words. The new regulations imposed by the United States and Europe are the largest threat to global growth, according to claims reported by Asian Investor. “Over-regulation and inappropriate interventions are the largest risks to the global recovery, which threaten the effective functioning of the financial system,” he said at an international conference held in Mumbai. “In the United States and Europe, over-regulation is widespread. In every sector, excessive regulation is an obstacle to economic development, in the same way that excessive taxation is destructive.” This increase in regulation will discourage investment, the CIC head says. The fund has assets under management of about USD410bn.
