Baring MENA Fund will contain at most 25% Turkish shares


Ghadir Abu Leil-Cooper, head of EMEA and manager of the Baring MENA fund, launched this Monday, says the Irish OEIC fund focused on the Middle East and North Africa (see Newsmanagers of 4 and 17 March) will have a concentrated portfolio of 20 to 50 positions, and that it is naturally a higher-risk product, as it will invest in equities from “frontier” markets, where there are both market, conjuncture, and political risks. Despite the considerable preference of the emerging markets team for Turkey, where Barings is largely overweight in the banking sector and estimates that with low interest rates the popularion may even be liable to take out mortgages, exposure to Turkey for the MENA fund is limited to 25%, “to avoid making another Turkey fund,” says the manager. There will also never be any Israeli shares in the portfolio, since Israel will be leaving emerging markets indices in one month’s time. In general, Abu Leil-Cooper says that some advantages of the countries of the MENA region are that they are rich in natural resources and have a young, growing population (which is expected to grow by the equivalent of twice the population of Egypt in the next 20 years), and that they are under-leveraged.
