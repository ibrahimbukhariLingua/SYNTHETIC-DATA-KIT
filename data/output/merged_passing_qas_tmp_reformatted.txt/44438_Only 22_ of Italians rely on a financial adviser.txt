Only 22% of Italians rely on a financial adviser


Only 22% of Italian investors rely on an expert or delegate the management of their investments, a study by the Italian financial markte authority (Consob) finds. This percentage is primarily women, self-employed persons, those aged between 45 and 64, and high net worth families. At the same time, 15% of Italians decide to invest independently. These are primarily individuals aged over 65 and less wealthy. Those who decide to invest alone also stand out for their low level of financial knowledge and aversion to loss. As of the end of 2014, the percentage of Italian families who received personalised advice (IFA advising) stood at about 9%.
