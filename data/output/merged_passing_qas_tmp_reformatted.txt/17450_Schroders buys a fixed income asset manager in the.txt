Schroders buys a fixed income asset manager in the US


Schroders has announced the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of STW Fixed Income Management LLC (STW), a value-orientated, US investment-grade fixed income manager, with about USD11.9bn in assets under management as at 30 September. The deal will be undertaken via its US subsidiary, Schroder U.S. Holdings Inc. “This acquisition increases our assets under management in US fixed income by 50 per cent. to USD35 billion,” says Michael Dobson, chief executive of Schroders, in a statement. This will also extends the institutional base of the UK asset management firm in the United States, where STW has more than 100 institutional clients. The transaction, which will be completed in the first quarter of 2013, is part of Schroders development plans in the United States announced by Massimo Tosato, executive vice-chairman of Schroders, in a recent interview with Newsmanagers. “We are attracted by the size of this [US] market, with USD25trn in disposable assets, and by its longevity. We are targeting a few post- and pre-retirement segments, with a range of international and complementary products,” he said at the end of November. “Now, 12% of our earnings come from there. North America represents 48% worldwide. We are not a US firm, and we are not expecting to get an equivalent market share, but between 12% and 48%, there’s room for progress!”
