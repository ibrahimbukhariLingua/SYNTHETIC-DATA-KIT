As a specialist in bottom-up active management and alternative investment, the team at RAM Systematic seeks to offer clients regular generation of alpha over the long term across economic cycles. The strategies offered apply fundamental analyses by the asset mangaement firm “while making an effort to take advantage of market fragmentation to pursue a wide range of investment opportunities presented by inefficiencies induced by the behavour of investors,” the boutique says. For its part, the team at RAM Tactical aims to “assist out clients to navigate in environments of unprecedented interest rates and the most volatile market conditions,” the asset management firm says. To do this, the team “applies discretionary discipline to unconventional approaches,” RAM continues. The objective of this management is to generate risk-adjusted returns referred to as “attractive” by the Swiss asset management firm. It offers “niche investment strategies over the full range of bond investments,” RAM concludes.
