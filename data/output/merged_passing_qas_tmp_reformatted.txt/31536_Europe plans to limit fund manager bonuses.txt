Europe plans to limit fund manager bonuses


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } Asset management firms are up in arms against European plans to enforce a maximum 1:1 ratio of bonus to salary for fund managers, the Financial Times reports. The plans, which would also require up to 60 per cent of the variable pay element to be deferred and largely paid in units of the funds the asset manager runs, focus on Ucits. Some executives of asset management firms are concerned that it will lead to job losses. The parliamentâ€™s main parties support inserting the curbs into a year-old reform proposal for Ucits funds, the Financial Times reports. All political blocs are expected to support the limit in a formal vote on Thursday.
