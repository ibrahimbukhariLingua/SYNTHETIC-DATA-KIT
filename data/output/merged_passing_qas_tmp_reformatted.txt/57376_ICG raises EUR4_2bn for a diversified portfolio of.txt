ICG raises EUR4.2bn for a diversified portfolio of loans


Intermediate Capital Group (ICG) , the specialist asset manager, today announces that following the fundraise for the third vintage of its Senior Debt Partners strategy , it has EUR 5.2bn of available ‘dry powder’ for deployment. The 2017 fundraising of the third vintage took place over just five months and includes EUR4.2bn of new commitments. ICG’s second vintage fund for the Senior Debt Partners strategy (EUR3bn) was raised in July 2015 and is already over 95% invested across c.40 deals, hence the latest fund raise. The latest commitments that have been raised will largely follow the same investment strategy as the previous vintage s and will invest primarily in directly originated senior secured loans to European mid - market corporate borrowers. They will focus on a diversified portfolio of loans to established corporate borrowers led by strong management teams principally in the UK and Europe. The 2017 fund raise was significantly oversubscribed and received strong support from both new and existing investors, with particularly high levels of interest from European and UK pension funds. The increased level of commitment for the strategy will allow the firm to access larger deal s which are not currently served by other players.
