IFAs turn their backs on funds


Mutual Fund Wire reports that independent financial advisers in 3009 sold fewer shares in mutual funds than in the past, according to a survey by the Financial Research Company of 958 advisers in the United States. 17% of respondents say they have less confidence in fund managers in a difficult economic environment. Most of those surveyed preferred to invest in alternative investments or ETFs. Only 35% increased their exposure to bonds.
