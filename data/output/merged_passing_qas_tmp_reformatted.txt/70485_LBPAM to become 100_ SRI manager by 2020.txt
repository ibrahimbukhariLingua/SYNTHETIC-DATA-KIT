LBPAM to become 100% SRI manager by 2020


La Banque Postale Asset Management is announcing an ambition to become the first generalist asset management firm to go 100% SRI by 2020. By this date, the firm hopes to have “moved all of our assets managed over to SRI management,” it announces. “Socially responsible investment (SRI) is not a trend, but rather the one relevant way to manage assets in years to come,” says Daniel Roy, chairman of the board at LBPAM, in a statement. “The objective of moving over all of the assets we manage to SRI by 2020 is ambitious, but responds to a conviction which is entirely shared by the teams at the group. We will mobilise all of our resources to gradually get all clients to join this movement.”All open products managed for retail and professional clients will converge into socially responsible management by 2020, the firm says. Meanwhile, LBPAM will conduct a campaign to raise awareness of institutional clients whose assets are not yet subject to extra-financial filters (thus mandates especially). “For open fund ranges, the eligibility criteria for the French SRI label will be used,” LBPAM adds.Additionally, LBPAM announces the launch of a product range in June 2018, to be entitled “Conviction ISR,” which will include four conviction-based SRI funds, and two solidaristic funds. The range will cover the major asset classes (equities, bonds, green bonds, money markets), different risk levels and management styles. “The launch of ‘Conviction ISR’ will be an occasion to announce the launch of a new fund, LBPAM ISR Diversifié, at the heart of this new range,” the asset management firm says.Currently, LBPAM has over 50% of its assets in SRI management, for about EUR109bn. The asset management firm has 26 funds with SRI, TEEC, Finansol or CIES labels.
