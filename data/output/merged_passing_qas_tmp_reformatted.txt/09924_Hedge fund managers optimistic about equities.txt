Hedge fund managers optimistic about equities


Hedge funds are looking optimstic about equities once again. According to a monthly survey for December by TrimTabs/BarclayHedge, 42% of respondents are optimistic about the future direction of the S&P 500, while only 30% are pessimistic, compared with 36% in November. This is the third time this year, after January and July, that managers have been this optimstic. This optimistic mood is also confirmed by flows into futures, TrimTabs reports, stating that there have been only seven weeks in 2011 during which hedge fund managers have been net buyers of futures on equities. Managers are also divided over the likelihood of a phase of quantitative easing in 2012, with negative opinions (39%) slightly edging out those who predict that there will be quantitative easing (37%). More than 50% of hedge fund managers are neutral on long-term Treasury bonds. The percentage of respondents with a negative outlook on the evolution of ten-year notes fell to 28% in December from 34.7% in November, while 15% are optimistic.
