European Parliament wants to facilitate prohibition of dangerous financial products


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Starting today, web surfers can vote at dangerous-finance.eu for the “most dangerous financial product,” Les Echos reports. The initiative is at the impetus of German MP Sven Giegold, of the Green party, who is highly critical of financial regulatory issues, alongside the Belgian Pierre Lamberts (the originator of bonus ceilings) and the French Pascl Canfin, before he left the European parliament to join the French government. “In many areas of economic life, it is possible to forbid dangerous products. This idea needs to be applied in the financial sphere as well,” he explains to Les Echos.
