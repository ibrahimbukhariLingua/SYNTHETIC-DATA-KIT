Blockchain could save asset management firms GBP1.9bn


The future of asset management firms may lie in blockchain. According to a study carried out by Calastone, a British company specialised in services to funds, migration to blockchain may generate over GBP1.9bn in savings for the global mutual fund market. The study follows a recent report by the agency Forrester, which found that Calastone had already made over GBP458m in savings for funds in the past six years, by automating the main fund markets. “The savings expected demonstrate the scale of the financial impact that automation and increased interconnectivity may have on the fund market,” Calastone finds. The estimates by Calastone are based on daily trading volumes for funds on the major markets: the United Kingdom, Ireland, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Australia.Figures released by Calastone represent the tangible financial value which distributed market infrastructure based on blockchain can contribute, by eliminating some inefficiencies which systems currently have, which increase cost, risk, and operational and regulatory pressure. Calastone has calculated the potential cost savings related to the transition to a distributed and mutualised market infrastructure using data from a study that Deloitte carried out in 2016 (“Costs for European funds at a turning point: advantages of mutualisation of distribution costs.”)
