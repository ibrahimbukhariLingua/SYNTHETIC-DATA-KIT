After market turbulence, investors readjust their portfolios


There are some concerns, in light of the market turbulence, that too many investors have purchased protection against falling equity markets in the next three months, BofA Merrill Lynch finds in its most recent Fund Manager Survey, conducted between 2 and 8 February, and covering a sample of 196 participants, with total asstes of USD575bn. Mangers have also reduced their equity exposure, and inflated their cash allocation to 4.7%, compared with 4.4% in January.“At a time when the survey for the month reveals that investors are holding more cash and reducing their equity allocations, neither of these two elements tips the balance to buy the fall,” says Michael Hartnett, head strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch. However, “allocation to European equities is at its lowest level in nearly one year,” says Manish Kabra, head of quantitative strategy for European equities. “Despite stronger confidence in European corporate profits, US and emerging market profit cycles currently appear more favourable to investors,” he adds.Exposure to equities has fallen to a net 43%, compared with an overweight of 55% previously, the steepest fall in one month in the past two years. Bond allocation is at a low, with an underweight of 69%. For 45% of investors, the top extreme risk is a bond crash triggered by inflation, followed by errors on the part of the Fed or the European Central Bank in management of monetary poicy (18%). The majority of investors (70%) feel that the global economy is now at the end of a cycle. This is the highest level since 2008.
