Danish pension fund FSP joins forces with local heavyweight AP Pension


Two of the largest pension funds in Denmark, AP Pension and FSP, have decided to join forces to form a new entity with assets under management totalling DKK77bn, or about EUR10.4bn. The new structure will be known as AP Pension. FSP, the pensoin fund for the financial sector, with DKK22bn in assets under management, has announced that it has decided to merge with AP Pension due to increased competition in the sector and regulations which require increased owners’ equity levels. FSP has been in the spotlight before due to its high cost levels. FSP charges a commission of DKK2,822 per year, compared with only DKK1,355 for AP Pension. The new fund will charge a total annual commission of between DKK1,350 and DKK1,500, with a reduction of up to 10% in the next few years. The merger is expected to be approved at the next combined general shareholders’ meeting of FSP, scheduled for 19 April.
