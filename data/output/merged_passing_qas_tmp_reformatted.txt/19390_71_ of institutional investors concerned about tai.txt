71% of institutional investors concerned about tail risk events, SSgA reports


A survey of 310 institutional investors in Western Europe and the US commissioned to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) by State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) reveals that 71 percent of institutional investors believe it is “highly likely” or “likely” that significant tail risk event will occur in the next 12 months. The research shows that the crisis in the Eurozone, the prospect of global or European recession and the slow-down in China among the concerns. Only 20 percent of respondents are “very confident” that they have some form of downside protection in place for the next significant event, with a further 61 percent “somewhat confident” of this. However, 73 percent of institutional investors believe that due to changes in their strategic asset allocation, they are better prepared for the next major tail risk event than they were before the start of the financial crisis, a press release explains. The data showed shifts in allocation – although interestingly, despite elevated concerns, the pace of change has been slower than expected. The widespread impact of tail risk events has resulted in a large proportion of investors reconsidering the products available to mitigate the impact of these events, beyond traditional diversification techniques. The survey showed gains in allocation to other alternatives, such as commodities and infrastructure, and managed futures/commodity trading advisor (CTA) strategies. The allocation to fund-of-hedge-funds declined significantly, with a 9 percentage point drop from pre-2008 figures.
