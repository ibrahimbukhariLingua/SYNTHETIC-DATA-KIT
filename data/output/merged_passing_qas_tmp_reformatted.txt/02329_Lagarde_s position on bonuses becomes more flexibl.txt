Lagarde’s position on bonuses becomes more flexible


France wants next week’s G20 to come up with concrete and detailed restrictions on financial-sector bonuses, but it won’t push for absolute caps, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. «We’re not so narrow-minded to the point that we want a number,» Ms. Lagarde said. «But we want (...) something that effectively limits and frames compensation.»
