Good outlooks for bond funds


A rise in interest in bond funds which began last year is expected to continue this year, but with a more moderate pace of inflows, Moody’s predicts in a report on the sector. Spreads have contracted after reaching all-time highs. Corporate debt issues are expected to decrease in this environment, and selection will be the key to performance, Moody’s estimates. The credit profiles of bond funds will stabilise due to an expected decline in defaults and a return to normal trading conditions. For bets on duration, Moody’s expects little movement in first half, but adds that second half may offer more custom trading opportunities as central banks call off their expansionist monetary policies. In the first nine months of 2009, bond funds attracted about EUR190bn in the United States and EUR50bn in Europe. The trend is expected to continue for most bond segments, and will be more pronounced for short-duration funds, absolute return funds and ETFs.
