Credit Suisse publishes revised results adapted to the new architecture of the group


Credit Suisse bank on 1 February published revised results, adapted to the new structure of the group. In the Private Banking & Wealth Management (BP&WM) division, asset management profits are now declared as a separate unit, as are resuls for Wealth Management Clients and Corporate & Institutional Clients. Securities trading in Switzerland has been largely transferred from the business bank to the PB&WM division, Credit Suisse says in a statement. These changes will have an effect on results for the three units of the PB&WM division, and on the business bank. The changes, and the transfer of securities trading, will have no effect on consolidated profits or net profits for Credit Suisse, however, which will adapt its figures retroactively to 2008. Credit Suisse in November 2012 announced a reorganisation of its organisation and its management, and plans to transfer private banking and asset management units to the PB&WM division.
