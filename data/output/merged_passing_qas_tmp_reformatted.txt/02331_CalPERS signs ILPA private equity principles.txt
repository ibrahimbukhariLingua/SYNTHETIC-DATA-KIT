CalPERS signs ILPA private equity principles


The California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) has announced that it is signing up to the new principles to align the interests of investors and managers in private equity, which were unveiled on 8 September by the Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA), which has 215 members with about USD1trn in assets under management in private equity. The three main principles are the alignment of interests with commissions that “reasonably” cover costs, a substantial investment on the part of general partners, and a balanced distribution of profits. The principles also extend to governance, with higher powers for limited partners when a fund is dissolved or suspended, and the independence of the auditor. Lastly, in terms of transparency, general partners are responsible for providing more details to investors on revenues from commissions and the performance of firms whose shares are in the portfolio. The ILPA principles are available on the website http://www.ilpa.orgAs of 31 July, private equity assets at CalPERS totalled USD20.6bn; the fund also had unfunded commitments for a further USD21.9bn in private equity.
