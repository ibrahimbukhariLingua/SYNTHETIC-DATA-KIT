DLPK plans to acquire APREP


The DLPK group, which includes the Nortia, Nortia Invest and Haas Gestion companies, is currently in talks to acquire APREP, the website H24 Finance reports. The news has been confirmed to editors at NewsManagers by the directors of DLPK. “This acquisition project confirms the strong ambitions of the group in terms of development and diversification; the entry into our capital of an investor like Blackfin in February this year has allowed us to seize external growth opportunities,” explains Vincent Dubois, chairman of the DLPK group.Following the acquisition of Sélection 1818 in April this year, the planned acquisition of APREP comes as an addition to the diversification strategy of the group for its activities, by adding wealth planning. The group may offer a full range of services to its IFA clients, and build a presence in remote services with the Groupe Expert & Finance, which is currently in negotiations to acquire the platform Finaveo.The APREP platform, which has EUR2bn in assets under management, is controlled by the La Mondiale group, which did not wish to comment at this stage in the talks.If the acquisition is confirmed, assets under management by the DLPK group for the savings branch (life insurance and securities accounts) would total EUR12bn. Additionally, all employees at APREP would be integrated into the group, which also plans to increase its teams at its two locations (Paris and Roubaix), to ensure the consistency and quality of its service. In total, personnel at the group may reach 200 by 2019.
