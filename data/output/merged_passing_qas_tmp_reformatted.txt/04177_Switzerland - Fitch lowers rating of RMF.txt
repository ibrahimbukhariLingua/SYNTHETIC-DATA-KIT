Switzerland - Fitch lowers rating of RMF


On Tuesday, Fitch Ratings announced that it is lowering its rating of the fund of hedge fund manager RMF Investment Management, an affiliate of Man Group, from FoHF M1 to FoHF M2+. The downgrade is due to a fall in assets since second quarter 2008 due to redemptions and market effects, and a loss of USD360m on an indirect exposure to the Madoff fraud, and a deterioration in performance. These factors have obliged Man Group to merge its two fund of hedge fund management affiliates, RMF and the American management firm Glenwood, to create a single management firm.
