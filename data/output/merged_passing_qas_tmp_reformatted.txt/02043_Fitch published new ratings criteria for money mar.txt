Fitch published new ratings criteria for money market funds


The Fitch agency on 5 October published its new ratings criteria for money market funds, particularly for funds which invest in short-term debt instruments issued by financial institutions, non-financial sector businesses, and ABCP programs. The publication of the new criteria coincides with recent proposals by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) to strengthen the regulatory framework governing money market funds. A new ratings scale and new definitions have been defined by Fitch, with an “AAAmmf” rating which will replace the “AAA/V1+” rating. This will aim to improve transparency, and to better differentiate ratings applicable to money market funds from those covering other debt instruments. Fitch has also set up a measure of global portfolio risk, which takes into account the quality of credit and its maturity, an analysis of the diversification of the fund, which takes into account direct and indirect exposure to credit risk, a daily and weekly measure of portfolio liquidity, a revision of recommendations which aim to reduce risks related to securities lending, and an evaluation of the role of the sponsor (investment management, risk monitoring, governance, administration, etc).
