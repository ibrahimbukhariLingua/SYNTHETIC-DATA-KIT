Investors cautious ahead of US elections


In the second half of October, money market funds saw outflows of over USD40bn, of which USD28bn were in the week to 31 October, according to estimates by EPFR Global. But investors have remained on the tips of their toes due to several factors: mixed quarterly results, hurricane Sandy and the approaching US elections. As a result, bond funds have posted inflows of only USD5bn, modest in comparison to the inflows observed in previous weeks. European and emerging market bond funds continued to attract more than USD1bn in subscriptions each in the final days of October. Equity funds took inflows of USD2.8bn, with demand remaining strong for emerging market equities, as Chinese equity funds attracted USD600m.
