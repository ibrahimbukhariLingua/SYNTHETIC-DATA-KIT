Germany - Real estate funds adopt prudent attitude


The open-ended real estate fund KanAm US-grundinvest, which has been buoyed by a strong US dollar, posts returns of about 23% over one year. Unfortunately, subscribers cannot take their profits, since redemptions of shares in the fund are frozen until October. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung also reports that the DSW association for the defence of securities investors is advising investors who need liquidity to sell their shares inâ€¯?frozen? real estate funds on the stock markets, rather than accepting settlements from the management firms, as these offers are well below the value of the shares.
