SRI still hesitating in choice of doctrine


There is no universal definition of socially responsible investment (SRI), and at least three methodologies are competing for the favour of managers, which include exclusion, ‘best-in-class’ and engagement, with other variants in between. This was the conclusion at a round table discussion held in Paris by the Belgian firm Petercam, in the presence of Grégoire Cousté, director general of the Responsible Investment Forum (FIR), which discussed methodology, ratings, reporting and bonds. All participants agreed that for the moment, SRI remains a subject which is very primarily (about 90%) for institutionals, in France as in Belgium. And it remains difficult to prove that there is “double alpha,” extra-financial and financial, although few could now accuse SRI of performing less well than traditional management, which is a significant development of the past two years. Ophélie Mortier, SRI co-ordinator at Petercam, says that the Belgian asset management firm, which is a signatory of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN-PRI), combines best-in-class and exclusion (tobacco, alcohol, pornography, and the criteria selected by the Norwegian Government Pension Fund – Global), to produce SRI and sustainable funds. For equities, assets at Petercam Equities Europe sustainable represent about 10% of those in the Europe equities fund, although after assets tripled earlier this year to about EUR250m, assets under management in the Petercam L Bonds Government Sustainable, a govies fund, are in the range of EUR8bn.
