Asset management professionals welcome the adoption of the report on ELTIFs


The European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA), the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (EVCA) and the Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE) have welcome the adoption by the European Parliament of its report on European Long-term Investment Funds (ELTIFs) on 17th April 2014. In a statement published on April 23, the three associations with members which actively promote the financing of long term investments, welcome the flexibility added in the proposal and in particular the inclusion of listed small and medium-sized enterprises up to 1 billion EUR market capitalisation in the scope of eligible investments The document also introduces additional flexibility for professional investors and enhanced status for semi-professional investors. The creation of separate professional and retail ELTIFs will help in providing suitable investment vehicles for both categories by giving professional ELTIF managers the possibility to disapply the provisions that are fit mainly for retail investors. Moreover, the identification of the third category of semi-professional investors reflects the market needs of actors that currently have a greater interest in investing in long-term projects. However, on a crucial point for investors, i.e. the right of investors in “retail ELTIFs” to redeem their shares prior to the end of the ELTIF’s lifetime, the European Parliament report does not create an efficient framework. This right should be left to the discretion of the ELTIF manager who should be provided with a list of available redemption policy tools while having the obligation to fully disclose the choice of these policy tools to the ELTIF investors.
