Sarasin scales up distribution in Germany


To develop its sales in Germany, where it has had a complete banking license since 2008, the Swiss Banque Sarasin, a specialist in sustainable investment, has announced the recruitment of three people for its institutional and wholesale client department in Frankfurt. Detlef Lau (formerly of Métropole Gestion) in early May joined the institutional section, while in early June, Michael Baier (formerly of DWS Investments) was appointed as director of strategic cooperations. From 1 July, Monika Wackermann (formerly of Axa Investment Managers) will handle relationships with institutional clients and distribution partners. She joins the team led by Christian Mosel, head of institutional and wholesale clients at Banque Sarasin Germany. In Switzerland, meanwhile, from 1 July, Banque Sarasin SA will be opening a new office at Schwanenplatz 4 in Lucerne. The Lucerne office “opens an attractive potential market,” and becomes the sixth Swiss location of the private bank which is active worldwide, following Basel, Bern, Geneva, Lugano, and Zurich, the Basel-based business says. The bank is also scaling up its presence in central Switzerland. The branch office will be directed by Markus Koch. The official opening will be held in September.
