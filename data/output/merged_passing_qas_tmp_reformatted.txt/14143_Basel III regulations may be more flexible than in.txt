Basel III regulations may be more flexible than initially thought


Owners’ equity requirements under Basel III regulations may be less strict than initially thought, according to the Financial Times. According to the draft directive’s owners’ equity rules, which have not yet been officially published, European banks would be allowed to use owner’s equity at their insurance affiliates in higher proportions than had initially been expected. The French banks Société Générale et BNP Paribas, which have insurance activities, would be at a particular advantage under these conditions. Some banks may also be allowed to continue to issue hybrid capital for a longer period than previously thought.
