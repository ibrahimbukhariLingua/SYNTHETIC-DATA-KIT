Alan Hevesi pleads guilty in “Pay to Play” scandal


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The former Comptroller of the State of New York has ultimately decided to plead guilty to corruption charges related to the government pension fund, the Wall Street Journal reports. He has agreed to cooperate with the authorities investigating the “Pay to Play” scandal. On Thursday, Hevesi admitted to having negotiated access to the pension fund which he previously directed, in exchange for personal profit and political favours. Hevesi admitted that he had accepted nearly USD1m in the form of overseas travel, contribution to electoral campaigns, and other advantages for himself and those associated with him from a California asset management firm which received a USD250m mandate from the New York Common Retirement Fund. Hevesi was sole trustee of the fund.
