Fall in the number of positions held by directors outside their own firms


A study of the identity of and changes to the management at businesses of the SBF 120 index between 1998 and the end of 2010 has found several consistent trends, including a trend in the number of women represented, as well as several changes. There has been a decline in the number of directorship positions held by directors outside their own firms, according to the study, published by the AMF in its Lettre Economique et Financi√®re for winder 2011. In 2010, 43.71% of directors had positions as a director at other publicly-traded firms, in France or abroad, compared with 50.91% in 2000. The average number of positions held by these directors was 1.77 in 2010, compared with 2.27 in 2000. Another development identified by the study is that there has been a rise in the frequency of changes in management since 2005. In addition, the number of disciplinary dismissals was higher than the number of non-disciplinary dismissals in 2004 and 2005, and in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Over the full period under study, there have been 210 changes of directors at 131 firms. Between 1998 and 2010, 60.65% of businesses had at least one change in management. Eight businesses (3.70%) have had four changes in management, and five CEOs, while 39.35% of businesses have retained the same director over the period under study.
