Skandia IG selects two Liontrust managers


Skandia Investment Group (SIG) has awarded a GBP28m mandate to James Inglis-Jones and Gary West of Liontrust in its Skandia UK Best Ideas Fund. The duo has been running a mandate in the Skandia European Best Ideas Fund since it launched over 3 years ago and has demonstrated that their investment process holds good for UK equities. The addition of James Inglis-Jones and Gary West to the UK Best Ideas line-up sees them taking over the mandate from Jacob de Tusch Lec of Artemis who is now concentrating on running his Global Equity Income Fund. Jacob de Tusch Lec has also been removed from the Skandia Global Best Ideas Fund but not replaced. His assets have instead been allocated across the four existing UK managers within the fund.
