Germany - ETC funds popular with investors


The World Gold Counil reports that investors in the second half of 2008 bought about USD21bn worth of gold, 150% more than in July-December 2007. In Germany, subscribers msot often chose the ETC Xetra-Gold, which replicates the price of one gram of gold in Euros, and the Gold Bullion Securities, which reflects the price of a tenth of an ounce, Die Welt reports. Martina Gruber of Deutsche Börse Commodities says that 420 investors have claimed redemptions in physical gold totalling 480 kilos of the precious metal, while in the first half of 2008, only two subscribers opted for this form of redemption. Delivery in physical gold takes about 10 days and costs EUR170 for a single one-kilo gold ingot. For the Xetra-Gold, deposits are stored in the vaults at the Neue Börse in Frankfurt-Hausen, where 24 tonnes of gold, with a value of about EUR600m, are located. For the Gold Bullion Securities fund from ETFS, the deposits are at HSBC in London.
