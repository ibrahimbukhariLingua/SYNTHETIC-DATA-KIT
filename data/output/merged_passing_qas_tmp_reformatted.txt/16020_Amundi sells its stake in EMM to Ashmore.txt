Amundi sells its stake in EMM to Ashmore


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Ashmore, a management firm based in London specialised in emerging markets, with USD46.7bn in assets under management, has announced an agreement to acquire a 62.9% stake in Emerging Markets Management for USD246m. The latter management firm, founded in the United States, which is also specialised in emerging markets, but with an emphasis on equities, counts Amundi, the asset management affiliate of Crédit Agricole and Société Générale, among its shareholders. The French firm controls only 11.5% of its capital (with a stake inherited from Crédit Agricole Asset Management), but it is an important partner at EMM. The US structure manages several emerging markets funds for Amundi, representing a total of EUR5bn in assets under management, out of a total of USD10.4bn in assets at AMM as of 31 January 2011 (or over EUR7bn). These distribution agreements will remain in place, Ashmore says; Amundi confirms this. However, the French management firm is exiting from the capital of EMM. Ashmore says the acquisition will allow it to increase its assets in emerging markets equities, which represent 20% of its total assets.
