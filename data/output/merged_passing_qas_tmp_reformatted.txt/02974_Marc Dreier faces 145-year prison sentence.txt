Marc Dreier faces 145-year prison sentence


The New York lawyer Marc Dreier, who defrauded professional investors including hedge funds of more than USD400m over five years, is facing a prison sentence of 145 years, the sentence being sought by the prosecutor, while Bernard Madoff received ‘only’ 150 years in prison for a USD65bn fraud, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. Dreier, who tried to defraud Fortress Investment Group, was arrested in December after posing as the chief legal officer of the Canadian teachers’ pension fund.
