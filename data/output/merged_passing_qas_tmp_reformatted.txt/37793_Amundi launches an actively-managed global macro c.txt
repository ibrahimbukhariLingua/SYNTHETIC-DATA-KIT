Amundi launches an actively-managed global macro currency bond fund


Amundi has launched a new bond sub-fund of its Luxembourg Sicav. Amundi Funds Global Macro Bonds & Currencies, managed by the Global Fixed Income and absolute return team based in London, aims to profit from the best opportunities on international bond markets, regardless of their evolution. The portfolio will invest in all bond securities, including government bonds, corporate bonds, emerging market bonds, and currencies. Due to the current evolution of interest rates and their low levels, Amundi Funds Global Macro Bonds & Currencies stands out for its flexible absolute return approach. “With the acceleration of growth in developed markets, the main central banks are beginning to adjust their liquidity projections, and the euro zone crisis appears to be attenuating,” a statement says, adding that these two factors are likely to influence interest and inflation rates. In this context, exposure to bonds is actively managed, free of benchmark indices in order to target positive returns, even in falling markets. In order to achieve these reutrn objectives, the fund follows a dynamic risk allocation. Lastly, the construction of the portfolio is based on a top-down approach, with a macroeconomic orientation that combines long- and short-term positions. In terms of returns, the fund aims to outperform the Euro Overnight Index Average daily compounded (EONIA) over a 3-year investment horizon.
