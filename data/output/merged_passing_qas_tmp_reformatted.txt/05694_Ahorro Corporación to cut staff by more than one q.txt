Ahorro Corporación to cut staff by more than one quarter


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Ahorro Corporación Financiera (ACF), a financial group consisting of 42 small and mid-sized savings banks, will lay off about 200 people out of total staff of 752, equivalent to 26.5% of its personnel, Cotizalia reports. The operation will take place through a general services outsourcing plan, according to sources familiar with the matter. It will not result in cold layoffs, as the staff concerned will be transferred to the outsourcing companies. In reality, total staff is already lower than the 752 recorded at the beginning of 2010, as there have been assisted departures, but no definite figure is available at present. ACF currently manages EUR6.4bn, 50% less than at the end of 2007.
