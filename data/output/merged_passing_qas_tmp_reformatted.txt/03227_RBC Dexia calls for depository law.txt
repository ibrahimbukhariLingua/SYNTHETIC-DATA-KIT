RBC Dexia calls for depository law


In an interview with Ignites Europe, Jean-Michel Loehr, chief industry and government relations at RBC Dexia Investors Services, says that a directive governing depositories would be a good thing for the sector. He says the decision of the court of appeals in Paris to require RBC Dexia and Société Générale to reimburse three alternative management OPCVM funds for which it is the depository, whose securities were outsourced to Lehman Brothers International for custody, is “unacceptable.” “The court decided that we had an obligation which goes far beyond what the world expected. That’s dangerous, since it affects the entire European sector,” he says.
