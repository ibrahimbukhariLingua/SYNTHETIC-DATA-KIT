ETF issuers will work together


“The attention of international regulators has reduced, and will continue to reduce, profit margins for operators in the ETF sector, but at the same time will allow the industry to develop more solidly,” says Clemens Reuter, global head of ETFs at UBS, in an interview with Plus 24. Asked about the need to create a European association for the sector, the director responds that this had previously been slowed by opposition between physical and synthetic replication ETF providers. “But with the drive to a single market, toward similar rules for products, regulations may also help to appease arguments between issuers and convince them to work together to promote the sector as a whole,” he says.
