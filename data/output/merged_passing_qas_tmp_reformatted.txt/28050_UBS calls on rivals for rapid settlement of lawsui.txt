UBS calls on rivals for rapid settlement of lawsuits


The chairman of the bank UBS, Axel Weber, has called on the firm’s rivals to quickly settle their lawsuits with supervisory and surveillance authorities, in order to reduce financial costs as far as possible, in an interview which appeared in the Börsen-Zeitung on Friday. The courts and regulators are tending to impose increasingly high fees, he says. “Trying to save time, without any real hope of winning a lawsuit … is vain and only increases the cost of a settlement,” says Weber. UBS has spent CHF4bn on fines, out-of-court settlements and damages and interest over lawsuits related to manipulation of Libor, debt securities in the United States and other cases, the German newspaper notes.
