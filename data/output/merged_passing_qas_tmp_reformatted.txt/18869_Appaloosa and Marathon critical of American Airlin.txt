Appaloosa and Marathon critical of American Airlines chief


The two hedge fund managers Appaloosa Management and Marathon Asset Management, which own about USD800m in bonds from American Airlines, have criticised the attitude of CEO Tom Horton. In a letter to him, they accuse him of lacking transparency in negotiations to pull the parent company, AMR, out of chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and of negotiating exclusively with a group of bond holders chosen by himself (including Pentwater Capital Management, Litespeed Management and J.P. Morgan Securities).Appaloosa and Marathon are also critical of the choice by AMR directors to continue to operate American without merging with US Airways.
