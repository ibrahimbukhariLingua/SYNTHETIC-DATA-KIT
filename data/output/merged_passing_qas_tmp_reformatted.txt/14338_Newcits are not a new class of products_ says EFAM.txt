Newcits are not a new class of products, says EFAMA


The European Fund and Asset Management Association (Efama) has published a report on the evolving investment strategies of UCITS. A working group was convened to examine the increasing sophistication of these products. Traditionally, UCITS funds have been regarded worldwide as plain vanilla investment funds which only employ traditional investment strategies. However, as allowed by the UCITS III Directive of 2001, there are nowadays more and more UCITS funds that use a wider range of techniques and instruments with the aim of managing the trade-off between risk and return. One of the main examples is using derivative techniques to generate “absolute” returns to the investors. The investor demand for these types of products has significantly increased since the financial markets crisis. In particular, there is clear investor desire to achieve yield uplift relative to the low returns on deposit accounts. At the same time there is a demand from investors for capital security. Commenting on the publication of the report Peter De Proft, director general of Efama, said: “The “Newcits” label was coined by the media and should not be adopted by the industry or regulators. We do not believe that it is necessary or beneficial to have a specific label for these funds. The universe of UCITS is evolving but this is encompassed by the UCITS regulatory framework. Moreover, the regulatory requirements and supervisory tools are being developed, especially under the UCITS IV framework, which enters into force on 1 July 2011”.
