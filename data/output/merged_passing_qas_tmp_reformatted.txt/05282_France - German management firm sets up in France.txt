France - German management firm sets up in France


The German management firm Hauck & Aufhäuser Asset Management GmbH (HAAM GmbH) is entering the French market. It has obtained a license from the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) to sell its H&A Lux Equities Value Invest fund, a European equities fund managed with a value approach by Nils Bartram and Gerold Granzeueur, in France.For its distribution, the management firm will rely on Investeam, a French third party marketing firm specialised in marketing funds in Europe and North America, with which it has signed an exclusive agreement. Institutional investors, IFAs and private clients will be targeted.Hauck & Aufhäuser Asset Management GmbH is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hauck & Aufhäuser Privatbankiers, which si one of the last German private banks in which a majority stake remains in private hands. The entity manages assets of EUR2.9bn, in the form of institutional mandates and funds under its own brand and funds outsourced to the management firm by third parties. It is specialised particularly in asset management and European bonds.The firm’s entry into the French market is a first move into the international sphere for the manager. The partnership with Investeam will allow it to enter France without investing too much, and is limited to a single fund for the moment, but may eventually be extended to include other products, such as bond funds.Investeam says this represents the first fruits of its campaign to develop its presence in Germany, where the firm is building its newly-founded activities. A structure is being created under the leadership of Jan Schulemann. In addition to exporting German management to other countries, the entity is also planning to import products from French or other international companies to Germany. Investeam is also present in Canada, and in France it recently introduced the Canadian management firm DundeeWealth, at the end of last year.
