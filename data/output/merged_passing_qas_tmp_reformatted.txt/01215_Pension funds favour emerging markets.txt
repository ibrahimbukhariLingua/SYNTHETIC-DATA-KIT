Pension funds favour emerging markets


The most recent edition of a survey by Baring Asset Management of British pension funds has found that 29% of respondents are now more likely to allocate their investments to emerging markets, compared with 0% last year and 4.35 in 2007. Among those who have invested in equities on emerging markets, 90% include Asia in their portfolio, while 76% have invested in Eastern Europe and Latin America. Meanwhile, 48% of British investors allocate part of their equities investments to a separate emerging markets category, while 43% invest in these markets as part of their global equities exposure. However, total allocation to equities has declined heavily in the past four years, from 60% in 2007 to 47% this year. Barings has now found that 14% of pension funds for businesses and local collectivities are regaining confidence in equities, as 14% of respondents say they are planning to increase their exposure to equities in the next 12 months, compared with 5% one year ago, while 52% are planning to maintain their allocation unchanged.
