High yield bonds must be handled with care


Caution: Fragile! The high yield bond sector should be handled with a lot of precaution, the research agency Cerulli emphasizes in the most recent edition of The Cerulli Edge - European Monthly Product Trends Edition, August 2013 Issue.Cerulli has focused on the more obscure qualities of the sector, due to the spectacular moves in flows observed recently. Flows to high-yield bond funds were dramatically reversed in June, bleeding EUR11 billion (USD14.6 billion) and bringing June year-to-date 2013 takings down to EUR7.7 billion.Confronting such movements requires a certain number of preconditions to be satisfied, to avoid severe consequences. «The first imperative is to stay active,» said David Walker, a senior analyst at Cerulli Associates. «Being able to modify portfolio duration and switch between markets is critical when rates start rising.""The second imperative is, do not grow too large,» added Barbara Wall, a Cerulli director. «Fund size limits maneuverability in thin markets. Liquidity risk, along with re-pricing and security-specific risks, are three central risks managers will have to be able to negotiate going into 2014."That said, fund flows in 2012 suggest allocators are not wholly convinced of the merits of staying small. The largest high-grade and high-yield credit managers raised more than half the flows in their respective sectors last year. Smaller funds gathered 40% of flows in 2012.The third must for managers is to use protection. High-yield managers confess relief at being untouched by the ban on naked short selling affecting European sovereign debt. Freedom to buy insurance using credit default swaps (CDS) is crucial. A significant impediment to CDS becoming more mainstream in high-yield strategies is that many of the current inflows are from allocators making their first allocation, and they believe wrongly that a plain vanilla cash fund has a lower risk profile.
