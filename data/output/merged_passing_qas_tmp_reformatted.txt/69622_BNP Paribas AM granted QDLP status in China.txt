BNP Paribas AM granted QDLP status in China


BNP Paribas Asset Management on 14 May announced that its WFOE (wholly foreign-owned equity) entity BNP Paribas Overseas Investment Fund Management (Shanghai) Co., Limited, has obtained the QDLP or Qualified Domestic Limited Partner qualification. This permits the entity to sell funds in continental China without the intermediary of a local player in a joint venture. “Continental Chinese investors are showing a growing interest in sustainable investments, largely thanks to the support of the Chinese government and organizations in the sector. In a promising environment for socially responsible investment, BNPP AM is positioning itself a the top international asset manager with a QDLP quota to offer a managed fund on the basis of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria,” a statement says.Since 2004, BNPP AM has been offering its international client exposure to the Chinese market as part of the qualified foreign institutional investor (QFII) regime. In September 2014, BNPP AM was one of the first asset management firms in the euro zone to receive the status of renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor (RQFII). Since then, BNPP AM has acquired RQFII licenses in Paris, Hong Kong and South Korea. To facilitate the launch of the QDLP programme, BNPP AM founded its WFOE joint venture in December 2014, one of the first WFOE firms to operate in the Shanghai free trade area.
