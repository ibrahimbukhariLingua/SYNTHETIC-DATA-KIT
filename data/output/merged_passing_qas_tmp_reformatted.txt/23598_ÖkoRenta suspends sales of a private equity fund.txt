ÖkoRenta suspends sales of a private equity fund


The German asset management firm ÖkoRenta, a specialist in sustainable investment, has decided to suspend sales of its fund investing in privat companies in the renewable energies sector, Ökorenta Zukunftsenergien I (ZE I), Fonds Professionell reports. The decision, which will remain in effect until the legal situation of the fund has been clarified, follows the passage by the German government of a law on 29 February which will “drastically” reduce subsidies for solar energy, starting from spring 2012. The move will result in a steep reduction in the earnings of service providers and producers in the sector, and will cause serious problems for sales of solar modules.
