Bob Doll to retire at BlackRock


Pension & Investments reports that it has obtained a copy of an internal memo stating that Bob Doll, executive managing director and chief strategist at BlackRock, has announced that he will be retiring at the end of June, to dedicate more time to his family, his faith and “philanthropic interests,” Funds People reports. The management of the BlackRock Large Cap Core Fund, Large Cap Growth Fund and Large Cap Value Fund will now be taken over by Chris Leavy, CIO for equities, whose co-manager will be Peter Sournaras. Doll will remain until the end of December as adviser to Leavy. However, BlackRock has not yet determined who will succeed Doll as chief strategist.
