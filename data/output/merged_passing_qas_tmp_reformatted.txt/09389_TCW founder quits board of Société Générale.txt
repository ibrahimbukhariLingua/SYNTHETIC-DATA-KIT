TCW founder quits board of Société Générale


The American billionaire Robert Day, who is suspected of insider trading, has resigned and will be leaving his position on the board of directors of Société Générale, Reuters reports, confirming earlier reports in Les Echos. Day, who founded and then sold TCW, an asset management firm, to Société Générale, is named in a class action suit in the United States accusing him of insider trading related to the Kerviel scandal. He is also under investigation by the French financial authority, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF).
