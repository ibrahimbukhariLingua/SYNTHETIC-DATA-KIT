Rising costs related to compliance penalise small firms


Costs related to regulatory compliance have more than doubled in the past five years for 63% of private banks with less than CHF10bn in assets, according to a study published on Monday by the ZeFir, the centre fore financial reguatory issues at the University of Zurich, Agefi Switzerland reports. To satisfy the regulations and laws currently in force, smaller firms also need to dedicate a proportionately larger number of employees in legal and compliance issues. This percentage runs as high as 5% for banks with less than CHF10bn in assets, compared with 2% for those with larger volumes.
