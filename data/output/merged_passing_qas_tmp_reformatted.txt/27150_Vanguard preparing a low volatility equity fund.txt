Vanguard preparing a low volatility equity fund


On 27 September, Vanguard submitted an application to the SEC for a license for a global low volatility equity fund, the Vanguard Global Minimum Volatility Fund, which will be launched in fourth quarter.The product is actively-managed, and will focus on securities with a lower volatility than global equity markets, and will invest about half of its assets in equities in US firms. In order to minimise currency risks and lower volatility, a part of the exposure to currencies will be hedged with forex futures contracts.Vanguard (USD2.25trn in US mutual funds, including over USD290bn in ETFs) is planning two share classes for the new fund: Investor shares, with a total expense ratio of 0.30%, and a minimal initial subscription of USD3,000, and Admiral shares, with a TER of 0.20%, and a minimal initial subscription of USD50,000.The new product will be managed by the Equity Investment Group from Vanguard, which is responsible for assets of USD13bn in traditional active quantitative strategies.
