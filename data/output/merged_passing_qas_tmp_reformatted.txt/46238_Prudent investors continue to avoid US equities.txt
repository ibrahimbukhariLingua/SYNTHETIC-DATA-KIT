Prudent investors continue to avoid US equities


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The scenario in previous weeks recurred in the week ending on 15 April, possibly with less conviction. Investors continued to prefer European equity funds and international ex-US equity funds, to the detriment of US equity funds, which have posted the strongest outflows. But the environment is anxious, as questions about the results at US companies, mixed figures from China, warnings from the International Monetary Fund about liquidity, and concerns about the Greek situation have made investors cautious. In the week ending on 15 April overall, bond funds attracted USD5.4bn in assets, while equity funds suffered a net outflow of about USD1bn, according to estimates from EPFR Global. Money market funds suffered an outflow of over USD30bn. US taxpayers had to meet tax deadlines, which resulted in outflows which did not offset inflows to European money market funds. For emerging countries, funds specialised in Asia continue to be advantages from the viewpoint of reforms, even though an examination of daily flows reveals that these have been slowing in recent days due to government plans to retroactively tax foreign funds a total of over USD6bn. However, funds specialised in Latin America are posting massive outflows related to the resistance of countries in the region to structural reforms.
