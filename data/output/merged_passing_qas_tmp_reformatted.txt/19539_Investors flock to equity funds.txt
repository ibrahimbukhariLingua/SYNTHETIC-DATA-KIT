Investors flock to equity funds


The generosity of central banks on both sides of the Atlantic has eased the apprehensions of investors, who have been investing largely in equity funds. In the week to 19 September, equity funds have posted net inflows of USD17bn, of which USD4.3bn have gone to emerging market equity funds, according to statistics from EPFR Global. US, European and international equity funds, which have also benefited from this regain in interest in the asset class, finished the week with net subscriptions totalling USD10.8bn. However, on the US side, net inflows total slightly over USD7.5bn, once again due to institutional investors. US retail investors have continued to steer clear of equities, and finished the week with redemptions totalling a net USD1.9bn. Bond funds attracted a further net USD6.3bn, with net subscriptions of USD3.6bn for high yield funds. Money market funds saw net outflows of USd17bn in the week to 19 September; US funds represent two thirds of this total.
