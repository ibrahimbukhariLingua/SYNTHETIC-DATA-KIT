World - Small hedge funds continued to outperform in 2008


Peter Urbani, CIO of the fund of hedge fund management firm Infinit Solutions, saysâ€¯?emerging managers? of hedge funds (less than 36 months of track records, and less than USD300m in assets) saw total losses last year of 16% to 18.2%, whiel the hedge fund sector as a whole lost about 20%, and some of the most well-established and largest products saw severe losses, sometimes of more than 50%, Hedge Week reports. This outperformance, though it was not enough to preserve invested capital, is due to the fact that the small size of these funds and their agility allowed them to react more quickly and vigorously to the crisis. They can also cut back staff and close offices more easily than older firms, though the larger companies are less vulnerable to redemption demands - which may also have prevented them from realising in time that investors were panicking.
