Bill Gross files suit against Pimco


Bill Gross has filed lawsuits against his former employer Pimco, and its parent company Allianz SE” with “hundreds of millions of dollars” at play, following his eviction in 2014, according to the news agency Bloomberg.The former chief investment officer at Pimco claims that he was pushed out the door by the directors of the asset management firm, who wanted to claim a larger percentage of the bonuses. Gross was supposed to receive a bonus of USD250m, but in light of his depaerture before the end of the third quarter of 2014, he ultimately only received a part of that amount.Gross hopes to reclaim no less than USD200m in damages and interest, which may then be given to charities, including the Pimco foundation.
