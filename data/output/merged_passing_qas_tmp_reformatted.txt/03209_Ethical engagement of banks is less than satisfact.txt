Ethical engagement of banks is less than satisfactory


A study by the Munich-based ratings agency oekom research of the social and environmental responsibility of 65 commercial banks worldwide finds that on average, these establishments receive a grade of C-, which is a rather poor result compared with other sectors. The best grades went to the German HypoVereinsBank (B-), followed by the Australian banks Westpac and National Australia Bank, with C+. In general, European and Australian banks got better grades than banks in the US and emerging countries, which scored worse. oekom research has found a net improvement as the range of sustainable development investment funds and mandates available from banks has grown, particularly in the areas of climate change and water. However, despite impressive growth, assets under management following ecological and social criteria continue to account for less than 3% of the total.
