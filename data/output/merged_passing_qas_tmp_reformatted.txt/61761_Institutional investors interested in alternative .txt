Institutional investors interested in alternative risk premia strategies


Nearly 77% of the institutional investors that Cerulli surveyed for a new report plan to increase their allocation to alternative risk premia strategies over the next 12 to 24 months; as they target such investors, asset managers must consider regional differences across Europe."Nordic investors favor off-the-shelf products, whereas Swiss investors increasingly ask for customization and bespoke alternative beta solutions,» notes Barbara Wall, Europe managing director at Cerulli. «Investors in France, meanwhile, are particularly interested in low-volatility strategies. Although French investors tend to be highly cautious, they are increasing their allocation to alternative risk premia strategies."Many French managers have expertise in quant funds and global asset managers are likely to experience strong competition from local players in France. «German institutions also display some interest in systematic strategies, but are even more cautious and dedicate more time to research than their counterparts elsewhere in Europe,» says Justina Deveikyte, associate director at Cerulli and lead author of the report. «Most German investors see quant strategies as highly complex and difficult to understand. Brand is also important to German investors; they often prefer to give their money to well-known global quant managers than to local quant managers,» she adds.Systematic or quant strategies have become increasingly sophisticated and have received considerable interest in recent years. Research for Cerulli Associates’ report European Alternative Products and Strategies 2017: Innovation in the Fast-Evolving Alternatives Industry shows that the systematic hedge fund industry now has almost EUR280 billion of assets under management. Approximately EUR112 billion is managed by Europe-based players.
