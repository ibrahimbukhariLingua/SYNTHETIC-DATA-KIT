Assets under management up at Saxo Bank


Assets under management at Saxo Bank as of the end of June totalled DKK35.69bn, or about EUR4.8bn, compared with EUR32.35bn (EUR4.34bn) as of the end of December 2011, the group announced on 24 August at a presentation of its semiannual results. In the period under review, Saxo Bank has added to its product range with the launch of an online platform dedicated to wealth management. However, due to feeble market activity, net profits at the group fell to DKK44m, from DKK346m in first half 2011.
