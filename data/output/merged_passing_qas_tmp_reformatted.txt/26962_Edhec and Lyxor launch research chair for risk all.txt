Edhec and Lyxor launch research chair for risk allocation


The Edhec Risk Institute and Lyxor Asset Management on 7 October announced the launch of a research chair for risk allocation solutions which may be used to set up high yield multi-asset class solutions, developed acording to the specific needs of investors.The first of the first three years of research funding awarded as part of the chair will be dedicated to the next generation of “risk parity,” which may have a major flaw, in that it is not sensitive to changes in the economic environment.The research team will be led by Lionel Martinelli, scientific director at the Edhec Risk Institute, assisted by Vincent Milhau, deputy scientific director, while Nicolas Gausset, director of management at Lyxor, and Thierry Roncalli, head of quantitative research at Lyxor, will participate in the scientific committee for the research chair.
