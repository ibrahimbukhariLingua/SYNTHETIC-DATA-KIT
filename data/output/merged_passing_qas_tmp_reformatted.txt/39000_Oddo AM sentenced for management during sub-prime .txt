Oddo AM sentenced for management during sub-prime crisis


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Oddo Asset Management has received a final sentence which will require it to pay back all the money invested by a professional client in the fund Oddo Cash Arbitrage, for fraudulent presentation of the composition of the fund, and the transfer into the fund of assets invested in sub-prime, Agefi Actifs reports in its 31 March edition. The fund was liquidated in early July 2007, following the liquidity crisis on the financial markets. The fund was split into two distinct parts, one of which with immediate liquidity, and one with long liquidity, while invetors who did not specify a choice saw their assets immediately transferred to the immediate liquidity fund, which had a significant risk of loss. In this case, a professional client who never replied lost 53% of his investment. The appeals court noted that “information materials provided to shareholders in the Oddo Cash Arbitrages fund, whether or not they were institutional, included real distortions of information of a nature to erroneously induce risk errors in the investment made, and the firm Oddo & Compagnie, and consequently its affiliate Oddo Asset Management, knew already in early March 2007 of the increased securitisation risks presented by products related to the US real estate market, at the point of deciding between 5 March and 5 July 2007, to transfer them from its traditional money market fund (FCP Premium Oddo Cash) to its dynamic money market funds, including the FCP Oddo Cash Arbitrages, against the interests of shareholders in these funds.”
