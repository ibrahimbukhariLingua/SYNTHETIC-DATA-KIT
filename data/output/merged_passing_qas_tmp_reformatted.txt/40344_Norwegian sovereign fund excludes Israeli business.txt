Norwegian sovereign fund excludes Israeli businesses


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Norwegian sovereign fund (USD810bn in assets) has prohibited investment in two Israeli companies, Africa Israel Investments and Danya Cebus, due to “serious violations” of human rights, Financial Times fund management reports. The Norwegian finance minister has placed the two businesses on a blacklist due to their suspected involvement in settlements in East Jerusalem, which are illegal under international law. The move comes in the context of a European boycott of Israeli busineses with activities in the Palestinian territories.
