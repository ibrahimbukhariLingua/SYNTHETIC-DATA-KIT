United States - Directors of management firms still well-paid


Directors in the asset management sector in the United States may have seen a reduction in their income, but they are not being subjected to the same wave of austerity that is washing over other financial professions, the Wall Street Journal reports. In 2008, US equities funds lost an average of 39%. But most pay scales for directors in asset management are tied to the profitability of the firm, and not only to the performance of funds, the WSJ remarks. In addition, the asset management sector has had only limited recourse to TARP funds.
