Investment consultants struggle to identify outperforming funds


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; }a:link { } Contrary to their claims, investment consultants are not able to actively identify funds which outperform their indices after costs, according to a study undertaken by the British antitrust authority, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The study was carried out at a time when the sector was the subject of a vast survey, and the CMA is expected to publish a final report this summer. “Several actors have stated that, on average, ‘recommended’ products outperform their respective indices. The empirical analysis we have carried out has found that this was only the cases when management fees were included. However, excluding fees, we did not find any evidence that products purchased on the basis of their ratings on average outperformed their benchmarks in a statistically significant way, nor that they outperformed unrated products significantly.” The study was based on statistics from 2006 to 2015. The CMA does admit, however, that recommendations are only one of the services offered by consultants.
