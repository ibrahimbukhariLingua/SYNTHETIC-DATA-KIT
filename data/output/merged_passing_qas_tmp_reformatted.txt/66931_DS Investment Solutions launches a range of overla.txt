In a context of low interest rates, investors are seeking performance on equity markets as well as protection against potential market declines. “The funds of the ‘Overlay’ range will allow investors to gain exposure to equity markets while benefiting from systematic long-term hedging against the steepest market drops,” Brice Gemino, chairman of DS Investment Solutions, said yesterday at a press presentation.The new range of funds, currently composed of two equity funds, both with the same hedging mechanism, is the result of a collaboration between three players: VIA AM, with recognised expertise in the area of equity investment strategy, with assets totalling nearly USD800m as of the end of July; Société Générale Corporate & Investment Banking, with eexpertise in the implementation of hedging strategies against market declines and improving performance, and lastly, DS Investment Solutions, with its knowledge of fund distribution.The first fund, Solys O’IncoM, invests in ‘high dividend’ international equities. The companies are selected on the basis of three criteria: growth indicators, valuation, and dividends. Subject to approval by the board of directors, the SOLYS O’IncoM fund plans to pay a semiannual dividend corresponding to 3% of its net asset value, or 6% per year.The other fund, O’SmartE, invests in European ‘high potential’ equities. Companies are selected according to three criteria: growth indicators, valuation, and profitability.“We are delighted to have teamed up with VIA AM and Société Général CIB to offer this new alternative to flexible wealth funds. The systematic hedging mechanism in our ‘overlay’ funds meets the needs of clients for contractual reassurance of the performance of their equity investment in case of a falling market,” says Gimeno.
