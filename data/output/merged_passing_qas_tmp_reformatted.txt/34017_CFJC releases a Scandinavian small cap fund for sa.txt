CFJC releases a Scandinavian small cap fund for sale


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } French investment company Compagnie Financière Jacques Cœur will be offering French institutional investors a fund of northern European small caps managed by the Swedish company Lannebo Fonder, with which it has formed a distribution partnership. The product, entitled Lannebo Småbolag, or small caps in Swedish, has received a sales license in France. The fund, managed by Johan Ståhl, invests in 40 small and mid-sized businesses listed in Northern Europe, with an emphasis on Sweden. More precisely, the manager targets companies with a market capitalisation representing less than 1% of total Swedish market capitalisation. As of the end of 2014, it corresponded to SEK50bn, or EUR5.4bn. The fund, launched in August 2000, as of the end of September had assets of SEK14.67bn, or EUR1.5bn. Lannebo Fonder, a specialist in active management, was founded in August 2000 by Anders Lannebo, a former manager from Robur, the asset management affiliate of the Swedish bank Swedbank, known in Swedish as “Mr. Funds.” His company now has about EUR5bn in assets under management, and 29 people, including 10 managers. In mid-year, the Swedish company formed a partnership with CFJC, by which it will sell a part of the Lannebo range to French institutional investors.
