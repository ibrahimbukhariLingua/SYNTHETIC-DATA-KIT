Innkeepers sues Cerberus


According to Innkeepers USA Trust, which operates hotels in the United States under the Hyatt and Marriott brand names, the private equity investor Cerberus Capital Management and Chatham Lodging Trust on 5 August called off plans to buy the hotel group only as a ploy to drive the price down, from a previously-agreed USD1.12bn.Inkeepers argues that the courts should require the buyers to consumate the deal at the agreed price, or to pay an agreed forfeit of USD20m for defaulting on the deal.
