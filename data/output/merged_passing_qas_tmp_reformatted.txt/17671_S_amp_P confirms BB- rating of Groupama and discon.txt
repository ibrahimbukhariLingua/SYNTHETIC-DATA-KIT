S&amp;P confirms BB- rating of Groupama and discontinues ratings


The financial ratings agency Standard & Poor’s (S&P) on 7 December confirmed the long-term BB- credit rating, and its associated negative outlook, for the mutual insurance firm Groupama, which will no longer be engaging its services. The agency states that the various ratings assigned to the insurer and its affiliates at the time that its evaluation was discontinued “reflecting the poor balance of capital to risk and weak risk management practices.” It also identifies “negative consequences of financial and operational decisions taken in the past.” The “good competitive position of Groupama on the French damage insurance market and its good liquidity profile … partially offset these weaknesses.” Thierry Martel, CEO of Groupama, on 5 December announced that the insurer had decided to discontinue ratings by Stanrd & Poor’s, but to continue to be rated by Fitch Ratings. “Previously, the group had used two agencies, since we were coming up to our IPO,” the director explains. “In that context, it was indispensable to be rated. We also had brokerage firms which considered it important to have a rating,” he added. But IPO plans were officially abandoned, and the two brokerage firms were sold as part of a restructuring plan at Groupama starting in late 2011. “We no longer need to be rated,” he concludes.
