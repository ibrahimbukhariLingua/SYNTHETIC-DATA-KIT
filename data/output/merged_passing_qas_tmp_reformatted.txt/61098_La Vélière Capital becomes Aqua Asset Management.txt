La Vélière Capital becomes Aqua Asset Management


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } A new name brings new perspectives. After a change in shareholder structure in February this year (NewsManagers of 3 February 2017), the asset management firm La Vélière Capital on 30 May announced that it is changing its name to become Aqua Asset Management. Aqua Asset Management, taken over by the founders of Aqua, an environmental and renewable energies investment holding company, will aim to develop investment solutions dedicated to major private and institutional investors. To do this, it will rely on expertise developed around three themes: European SMEs active in the energy transition, real estate and infrastructure assets (including environmental assets) and European SMEs undergoing restructuring. “Our objective is to reposition La Vélière Capital, diversify its expertise and access new end investors. The change in name underscores these development plans,” says Lionel Le Maux, chairman of Aqua Asset Management.
