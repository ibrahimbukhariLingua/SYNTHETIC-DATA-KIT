The AXA World Funds Mix In Perspectives fund aims to generate long-term value by investing in a universe of equities in international companies which emphasize the best practices in terms of gender diversity. The approach aims to generate financial and stock market value by creating a positive social impact and promoting the most dynamic companies in terms of diversity and inclusion. The manager of the fund, Julie Lamiel, will select securities based on profound fundamental analysis. The objective is to identify companies which, according to AXA IM, offer higher growth potential than the rest of the market, and which have demonstrated a strong engagemment to promote diversity at all levels. The strategy will be managed by teams at AXA IM Framlingon Equities and Socially Responsible Investment. The fund will be available to retail and institutional investors. It has been registered in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Finland, Spain, Italy (institutional clients only), Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, and will soon be registered in Switzerland and Portugal. It is slated for launch on 28 February.
