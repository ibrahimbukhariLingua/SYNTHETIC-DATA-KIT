Tobam applies its diversification principles to emerging markets


The asset management firm Tobam on Monday, 11 July announced the launch of the Anti-Benchmark Emerging Market Equity fund. The UCITS III-compliant, OPCVM format fund aims to maximise diversification through an application of the Anti-Benchmark process to the entire emerging markets universe, represented by the MSCI Emerging Market index.In order to deliver investors the risk premia that are genuinely available on this market, the fund eliminates geographical, style and sectoral biases which may be involved in more traditional management, such as weighting by cap size. In terms of performance, the fund aims to outperform the cap size-weighted emerging markets index by about 4% to 6% per year, while significantly reducing volatility (about 30%).CharacteristicsName: TOBAM Anti-Benchmark Emerging Market Equity FundISIN codes: FR0011039320Benchmark index: MSCI Emerging MarketsLiquidity: Daily
