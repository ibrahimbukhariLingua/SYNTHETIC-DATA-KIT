ESG ratings for funds to be treated with caution


While Cerulli Associates regards ESG ratings for funds as a «creditable step toward improving the asset management industry’s ESG transparency and awareness», it also warns of the need for caution. Morningstar and MSCI recently introduced sustainability ratings for mutual funds and for ETFs."Independent ratings will likely force managers to reveal more detail on the implementation of their ESG policies--those that fail to comply may suffer low ESG ratings, which may well result in outflows,» says Barbara Wall, Europe managing director at Cerulli. «However, these ratings may contain size or industry biases, therefore asset managers and asset owners should not unreservedly trust the accuracy or comparability of an ESG score."Cerulli expects that retail investors and private banks will be the main market for ESG funds ratings. Although institutional investors are the primary drivers of demand for sustainable investment, they prefer mandates and bespoke solutions--thus generic ESG scores will be of little value to them.Cerulli also warns that rating agencies can produce very different ESG ratings for the same companies or funds. «It is therefore crucial that users understand the differences in the methodologies used by the agencies, and not blindly count on one ESG score,» says Justina Deveikyte, senior analyst at Cerulli.
