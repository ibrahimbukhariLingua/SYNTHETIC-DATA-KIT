Liikanen report favours separation of high-risk activities from banking


The riskiest activities undertaken by banks should be separated from the rest of their activites and grouped together into entities which are separate from the banking groups, according to a report submitted on 2 October to the European Commission. The report from the working group chaired by the governor of the Bank of Finland, Erkki Liikanen, much-awaited by the banking industry, was submitted yesterday to the European commissioner for the interior market and services, Michel Barnier.In brief, the group recommends action on the five following points:* requirement that owners’ equity trading and other high-risk market activities be separated,* means to separate other activities in accordance with bailout and default resolution plans,* means to modify the use of internal liquidity mechanisms as an instrument to resolve crises,* revision of owners’ equity requirements compared with assets held for transactional purposes and real estate lending, and* strengthened governance and controls at banks.“This report will feed our reflections on further measures to take. I will now consider the next steps, as a part of which the Commission will study the impact of these recommendations,” said Barnier, in a statement. The Commission will launch consultations before deciding whether to apply the report in the form of legislative proposals.
