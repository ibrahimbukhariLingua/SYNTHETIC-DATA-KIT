EDRAM grows in Germany


In an interview with the BÃ¶rsen-Zeitung, CEO Philippe Couvrecelle says that one year after opening its office in Frankfurt, Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (EDRAM), which started out with no clients or assets in Germany, has now won its first mandate, for a European institutional equity fund, and has posted subscriptions to the institutional share classes of its funds. He has not provided any figures.
