IMA releases guidance for improved management fee information


The British Investment Fund Association (IMA) on 20 September published a guidance on ways to improve information published about fees and transaction costs for licensed British funds.The guidance suggests that actors in the sector should go further than the terms of the MiFID directive, by offering more complete information about transaction costs, including average transaction costs over three years in brokerage commissions and stamp duties, expressed as a percentage of net assets.It also suggests that an ongoing charges figure (OCF) should be published, rather than annual management fees (AMC), since OCF provides a much more complete picture of fees, while also complying with the new key investor information document (KIID) requirements.
