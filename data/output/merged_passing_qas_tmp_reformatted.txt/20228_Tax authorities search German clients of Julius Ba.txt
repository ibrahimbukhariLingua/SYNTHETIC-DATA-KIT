Tax authorities search German clients of Julius Baer


In its 24 August issue, manager magazin reports that inspectors from the North Rhenania-Westphalia tax authorities in mid-August conducted targeted searches of the homes of several German clients of the Swiss private bank Julius Baer, seeking proof of tax evasion. It would appear that the information which the tax authorities obtained was of excellent quality. North Rhenania-Westphalia is the German state which purchased several CD-ROMs containing data on German clients of Swiss banks.
