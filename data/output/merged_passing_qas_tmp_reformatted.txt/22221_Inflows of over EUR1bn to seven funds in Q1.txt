Inflows of over EUR1bn to seven funds in Q1


Seven funds in Europe attracted inflows of more than EUR1bn over the first quarter of the year, headed by AllianceBernstein’s American Income Portfolio (EUR2.0bn), PIMCO Global Investment Grade Credit (EUR1.8bn) and M&G Optimal Income (EUR1.6bn), according to Lipper. Not surprisingly, at group level, Allianz/PIMCO (EUR7.3bn), AXA/AllianceBernstein (EUR5.7bn) and M&G/Prudential (EUR4.3bn) generated the greatest net sales over the first quarter.Overall, the European funds industry enjoyed its greatest inflows over the first quarter of the year (EUR87.4bn) since the start of 2007 (EUR133.4bn), underpinned by the best sales of bond funds in an opening quarter (EUR57.9bn) for the decade.When money market funds are excluded in order to look at ‘long-term’ funds, the total for the past three months stands at EUR77.1bn, better than 2007 (EUR61.4bn), but lower than 2010 (EUR104.7bn). The start to the year has been dominated by interest in High Yield funds (with USD products accounting for EUR8.1bn of the EUR17.4bn total) and emerging market debt (EUR11.6bn, of which EUR3.4bn moved into local currency funds). Appetite for equities slowed in March, but the quarter total still stands at EUR12.2bn.
