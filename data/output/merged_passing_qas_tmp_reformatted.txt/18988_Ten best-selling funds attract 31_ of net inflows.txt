Ten best-selling funds attract 31% of net inflows


The ten most successful funds in 2012 (to the end of July) have attracted 31% of all net sales across 21,916 equity, bond and mixed asset funds, according to Lipper.While the overall trend is broadly of an increasing concentration of sales into the best-selling funds (from 13% in 2003 to 31% this year) it is worth noting that in 2007, 2008 and 2011 the industry suffered net outflows so the best-selling funds would have stood out even more.Showing the ten best-selling funds as a proportion of all funds with inflows in each respective year the trend revealed is of an increasing domination of the most successful funds between 2006 and 2010 (from 4% to 11%) but, unlike for the comparison with all funds, this dominance has dropped back in 2011-2012 (8% this year). The proportion of funds that have managed to attract positive inflows each year is also shown and the general trend here is of a declining proportion of funds with annual inflows (from 50% in 2003 to 37% in 2012). If the proportion of funds achieving inflows in 2012 rises to 50% this will equate to more than 11,360 funds â€“ 2,865 more than have enjoyed inflows so far this year (the 2012 proportion is currently 37%).
