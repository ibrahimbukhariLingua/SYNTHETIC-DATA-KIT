United States - Two Senators propose legislation to require transparency of hedge funds


US Senators Carl Levin and Charles Grassley have unveiled a bill known as the Hedge Fund Transparency Act, which would require hedge funds with more than USD50m in assets to register with the SEC, and to disclose their total assets under management as well as the names of their investors and prime brokers, the Wall Street Journal reports. The bill also would make registered hedge funds subject to random audits by the regulator.
