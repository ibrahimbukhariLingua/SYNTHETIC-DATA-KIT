US asset management firms under the eye of regulators


The financial research office of the US Treasury on Monday published a report detailing the ways in which the asset management industry could create vulnerabilities for the financial system, the Financial Times reports. The data will be used by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which ordered the report, and decides whether certain non-banking institutions present a systemic risk. The research office finds that asset management firms can create vulnerabilities in the financial system, if they increase their leverage, buy similar assets at the same time due to competitive pressure, or start massively selling off.
