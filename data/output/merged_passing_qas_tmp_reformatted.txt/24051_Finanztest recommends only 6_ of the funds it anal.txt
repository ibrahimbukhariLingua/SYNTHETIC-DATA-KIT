Finanztest recommends only 6% of the funds it analyses


In the March issue of its magazine Finanztest, the German consumer defense organisation Stiftung Warentest analysed 2,850 of the over 10,000 funds on sale in Germany. It selected only 170 of these, less than 6%, as recommended, because they had a better track record than an ETF in the same category, Das Investment reports.Among equity funds, only 36 out of 539, or 6.68%, were selected from a list of recommendations, as they had better results than the iShares MSCI World ETF. The M&G Global Basics fund from Graham French is the fund which shows the best returns, while the R&P Universal (Universal Investment) has the lowest risk. The most “effective” fund is the Uni Global from Union Investment, which has a slightly higher performance than the benchmark ETF with lower risk.
