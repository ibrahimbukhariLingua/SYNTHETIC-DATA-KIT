WisdomTree launches at currency-hedged ETF


On Monday, Wisdom Tree Investments announced that its affiliate, Wisdom Tree Asset Management, will be advisor, and Mellon Capital Management will serve as sub-advisor for its 52nd ETF product, the International Hedged Equity ETF (HEDJ), which replicates the WisdomTree DEFA International Hedged Equity Index, with a management commission of 0.58%. The new product offers U.S. investors exposure to European, Australasian and far Eastern equities, while neutralizing the impact of local currencies against the US dollar.
