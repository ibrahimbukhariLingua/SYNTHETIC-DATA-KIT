p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Agefi reports that Detusche Bank has entered exclusive talks with the Liechtenstein wealth management firm LGT Group over a sale of BHF-Bank, which the German bank has been seeking to sell off since July this year. The Frankfurt-based firm, which offers private banking, asset management and investment banking services, has about EUR43bn in assets under management. While the book value of BHF-Bank totals about EUR640m, according to the German press, the total may come to considerably less than that. Sal. Oppenheim, which has been acquired by Deutsche Bank, acquired the firm in 2004 from ING for EUR600m. By signing a deal with LGT, DB would finalise its complete disengagement from BHF, the newspaper notes.
