Fitch loses two clients on the same day


A few minutes apart, Fitch Ratings announced on Tuesday that it will be withdrawing its asset manager ratings of M2 and M3 for Pioneer Investments (UniCredit group) and the Italian independent management firm Arca SGR, respectively. The two managers will no longer be rated by Fitch. Olivier Fines, an analyst at the ratings agency in Paris, explains that there was no analytical or corporate connection with the situation at the two companies, which will no longer provide Fitch with access to information, and no longer wish to publish ratings. In Dublin, Pioneer Investments has announced that it has decided not to renew its contract with Fitch Ratings, which led the agency to withdraw its rating. The manager explains that the client due diligence process has become increasingly complex, as clients prefer to make their own analysis of asset management firms. With the independent ratings of product quality from Morningstar, Pioneer estimates that there is no longer any commercial reason to continue its collaboration with Fitch. For its part, Arca SGR (EUR19.7bn in assets, 650,000 clients) has confirmed that it has not renewed its contract for the current year to deliver ratings of investment activities, while as in previous years, the Milan-based management firm has applied for GIPS-IPPS certification. Arca SGR states that since 1999 it has been in compliance with GIPS standards.
