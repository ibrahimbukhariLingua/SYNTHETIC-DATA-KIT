Henderson sued by several pension funds


Several UK pension funds have filed a lawsuit against Henderson Global Investors, over its decision to acquire the infrastructure group John Laing in 2006 for its PFI Secondary Fund II, IPE.com reports. The pension funds, which invested in the fund, claim that the deal exposed them to unexpected liabilities (including the John Laing pension deficit), which resulted in a 66% fall in the value of PFI Secondary.
