Greek debt: arbitrage funds dragging feet over haircut deal


Negotiations over private sector involvement (PSI) are getting heated in Athens, Agefi reports. The Greek government is alarmed at the prospect of its potential collapse. Several sources cited by the Reuters and Bloomberg agencies say that the case is potentially explosive due to positions built up by some hedge funds. York Capital, Och Ziff and Marathon Asset Management are part of a group of investors who may derail an agreement. The funds are hoping to pull the agreement off track and gain a full repayment. But the strategy is risky, the newspaper states. Greece may force the hedge funds, which are dragging their feet in the hope of making fat profits, to agree to the new deal, a European source tells Reuters. The mechanism is not very coherent with the theoretically “voluntary” nature of PSI.
