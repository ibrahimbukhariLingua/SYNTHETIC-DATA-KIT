Rothschild &amp; Cie Gestion shifts into recruitment mode


One year after his arrival as head of the management firm Rothschild & Cie Gestion (on 1 September 2009), Jean-Louis Laurens remains sufficiently confident in the future to foresee further recruitments. At a presentation of the strategic committeeâ€™s directions for the firm on 16 September, the director told Newsmanagers that the firm has not ruled out recruiting up to three specialists for emerging markets management, and two sales people. Didier Bouvignies, managing partner and head of management, says that for the past six months there has been a consolidation in emerging markets, and the increases are not more related to changes in currencies related to the US dollar than to the intrinsic valuation of shares. This position remains important at Rothschild & Cie Gestion, but in the short term, managers, who use a stock-picking strategy, are expecting some consolidation, depending on the way that flows evolve.p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }
