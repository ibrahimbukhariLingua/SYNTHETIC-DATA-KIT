After Newtown shooting, Cerberus liquidates Freedom position


Under pressure from the California pension fund CalSTRS, which has placed USD750m with it, Cerberus Capital Management has announced plans to immediately commence liquidation of its stake in the weapons manufacturer Freedom Group, Die Welt reports. The private equity investor has merged the weapons manufacturer Bushmaster, acquired in 2006, whose AR15 model assault rifle was used in the Newtown shooting, into the group.
