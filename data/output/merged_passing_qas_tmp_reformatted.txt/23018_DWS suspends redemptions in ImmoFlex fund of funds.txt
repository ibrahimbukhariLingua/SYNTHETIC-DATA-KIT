DWS suspends redemptions in ImmoFlex fund of funds


DWS Investment (Deutsche Bank group) has had to freeze redemptions of its ImmoFlex Vermögensmandat fund of funds, with assets of EUR101.5m. Five other funds of this type have already been required to do likewise, as eight open-ended real estate funds are now in the liquidation process, and six others have recently announced that they are extending redemption freezes. As the DWS ImmoFlex Vermögensmandat is largely invested in open-ended real estate funds whose redemptions are suspended, the available liquidity is not sufficient to meet redemption demands, except by selling off assets at a loss and a disadvantage to shareholders. Overall, the DWS ImmoFlex Vermögensmandat is invested in 10 open-ended real estate funds, which hold about 500 properties.
