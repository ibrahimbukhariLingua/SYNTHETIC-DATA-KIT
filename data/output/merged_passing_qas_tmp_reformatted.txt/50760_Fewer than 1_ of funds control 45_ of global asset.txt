Fewer than 1% of funds control 45% of global assets


“Winner takes all:” the adage seems to confirm the findings of the research agency Propinquity. According to data released on 30 June, fewer than 1% of the approximately 65,000 mutual funds available for sale worldwide ocntrol 45% of global assets, which total USD23trn. The cause of this development is mega-funds, with assets of over USD5bn, which are responsible for nearly 50% (more precisely 48.1%) of growth in assets in the sector in the past ten years. There are 634 of these mega-funds, 446 of which are based in the United States, says Propinquity, with 82.9% of assets in mega-funds (USD8.5trn out of USD10.2trn). The US market is thus far more concentrated than the European market. Mega-funds represent 68.7% of assets in mutual funds in the United States, compared with only 16.9% in Europe. Another trend identified by Propinquity is the role played by passively-managed funds as part of the concentration of assets. In fourth quarter 2016,, passively-managed funds represented about one quarter (25.8%) of assets in mega-funds, and 15.1% of funds overall. The average liabilities for mega-funds totalled USD40.1bn as of second quarter, compared with USD13.bn for their actively-managed equivalents.
