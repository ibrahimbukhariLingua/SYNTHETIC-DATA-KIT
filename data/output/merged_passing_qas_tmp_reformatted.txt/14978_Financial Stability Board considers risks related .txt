Financial Stability Board considers risks related to ETFs


As part of its mandate to monitor market developments, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) on 12 April published a report on potential risks related to the rapid growth of ETFs (“Potential Financial Stability Issues Arising from Recent Trends in Exchange-Traded Funds.”) In addition to its rapid growth, the ETF market, which still consists largely of simple products, has diversified its range, with complex products in some cases. The report aims to improve understanding of financial stability issues related to these developments, and to encourage the financial sector to adapt its risk management and information practices to the pace of innovation in the market.
