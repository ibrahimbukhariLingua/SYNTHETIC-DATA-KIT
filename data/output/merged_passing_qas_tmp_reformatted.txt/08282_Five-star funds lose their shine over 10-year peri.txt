Five-star funds lose their shine over 10-year periods


Tim Courtney, CIO of Burns Advisory, has studied the 10-year performance of five-star-rated funds. Of the 248 stock funds with five-star ratings on Dec. 31, 1999, just four still kept that rank after 10 years. And the 218 domestic stock funds with the rating typically lagged behind their category averages over the period. In other words, it isn’t just that five-star funds don’t, on average, continue to lead their peers, they actually do worse in subsequent years, says the Wall Street Journal.
