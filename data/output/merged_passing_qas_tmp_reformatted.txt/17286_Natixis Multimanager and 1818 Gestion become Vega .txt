Natixis Multimanager and 1818 Gestion become Vega Investment Managers


From 1 January, Natixis Multimanager, the asset management affiliate of Natixis Asset Management dedicated to multi-management, will be merging its activities with those of 1818 Gestion, an asset management affiliate of BP 1818 specialised in providing investment products and services to wealth management clients of the BPCE Group and BP 1818. In practice, 1818 Gestion, the firm which will be absorbing the other, will become Vega Investment Managers. “The transaction will take the form of a merger, and will allow a joint management firm for private banking professions (high net worth and wealth management clients) and asset management with open architecture aimed at other target clients of Natixis – clients of the BPCE Group and external corporate or institutional clients – to emerge,” a statement says.
