UBS opens Global Family Office for French-speaking Switzerland


UBS is building its presence in Geneva in the ultra-high net worth and family office segments. To this end, two new heads have been appointed, and an doffice for the Global Family Office (GFO) in French-speaking Switzerland has been created, according to a statement released on 7 November. The GFO structure in Geneva is now led by Alain Krüger, while Marc Mandosse is responsible for Ultra-High Net Worth (UHNW). The two new heads “have considerable experience in banking and solid international references.” The arrival of Krüger allows UBS to create a branch office for the GFO in French-speaking Switzerland, providing its private clients with “direct access to solutions offered by the UBS group.”
