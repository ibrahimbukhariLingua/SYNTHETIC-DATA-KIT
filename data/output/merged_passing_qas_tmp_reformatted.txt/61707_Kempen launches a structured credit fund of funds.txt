Kempen launches a structured credit fund of funds


The Netherlands-based asset management firm Kempen Capital Management (Kempen) on 24 April announced the launch of the Diversified Structured Credit Pool, a new structured credit fund of funds. The vehicle will primarily target long-only structured credit funds from three specialist companies: GoldenTree, LibreMax and One Williams Street, the asset management firm says in a statement. The Diversified Structured Credit Pool will invest in investment grade and sub-investment grade bonds, with an interest duration of 2 to 3 years. It will target residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), senior collateralized loan obligations (CLO) and consumer loans, or consumer ABS. From a geographical standpoint, it will invest 80% to 85% in the US market, and 15% to 20% in Europe. The objective is to earn total net returns of 4% to 6% per year. Kempen emphasizes that the structured credit market is one of the largest markets in the world, representing USD2.8trn. “This market is two times larger than the US high yield market, and six times larger than the European high yield market,” the firm notes in a statement.
