Janus launches a dynamic asset allocation fund


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; }a:link { } Janus Capital, whose assets under management as of the end of March totalled nearly USD190bn, has launched the Janus Adaptive Global Allocation Fund, an allocation fund which aims for total returns by implementing a dynamic asset allocation to a portfolio of international equities and bonds. The fund will be managed jointly by Ashwin Alankar, global head of asset allocation and risk management, and Enrique Chang, chief investment officer for equities and asset allocation. The Janus Adaptive Global Allocation Fund targets advisers and their clients as its priority. The Janus Adaptive Multi-Asset Strategy fund, a variant of the fund designed for institutional clients, will be launched on 30 June. This strategy, aimed at institutionals, stands out from the initial fund to the extent that it can invest beyond equities and bonds in assets which offer protection against inflation, such as commodities and inflation-linked bonds. Additionally, this strategy is oriented to absolute returns, with Libor as its base benchmark.
