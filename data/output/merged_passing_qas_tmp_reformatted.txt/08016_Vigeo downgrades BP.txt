Vigeo downgrades BP


Vigeo announced on Tuesday that it has lowered its ratings for BP. “The downgrade comes after several weeks of examination of the behaviour of BP and investigations by the US authorities following the ecological disaster in the Gulf of Mexico,” the extra-financial ratings agency explains. “Due to serious reports about the weak level of diligence and doubts about the sincerity of communications by the business about the safety of its offshore installations and the volumes of oil being leaked, Vigeo is again revising its opinions about the integrity of environmental management systems and the security of the group downward to a minimal level,” the agency says.
