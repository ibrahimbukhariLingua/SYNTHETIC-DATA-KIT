Argos IM becomes Quaero Capital


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Geneva-based asset management firm Argos Investment Managers SA has changed its company name to become QUAERO Capital SA. The change is due to a desire to develop in new sectors, and to ensure future growth due to having a unique brand in all markets. Quaero Capital, founded in 2005 in Geneva by Cristofer Gelli and Philip Best under the name Argos Investment Managers, is an independent asset management firm specialised in the management of high-added value investment funds for professional clients. The two founding partners were joined in 2011 by Jean Keller, CEO, and in 2014 by Thierry Callault, chief development officer. The change of names is motivated by a desire on the part of Quaero to develop in markets and sectors where its old company name may result in risks of confusion with existing brands. Quaero, 100% owned by its employees, offers a range of 12 strategies, available via segregated mandates or investment funds, which share the same predilection for independent thining and original analysis. The funds, marked by strong convictions, are incorporated as part of two Luxembourg SICAV umbrella funds (one Part I UCITS and one SIF fund) and are all based on a distinctive approach and fundamental analysis. Quaero has CHF600m in assets under management, with 27 personnel in 4 offices in Europe (Geneva, Zurich, Paris and London).
