Further tensions revealed at Pimco


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } One of the three men picked as deputies to Bill Gross, chief investment officer at Pimco, left the firm, on the day that his appointment was due to be announced, the Financial Times has learned. Marc Sneider, a generalist fund manager, interim head of equities last year, resigned in January, a few hours before the announcement by Pimco that Mohamed El-Erian, heir apparent to Bill Gross, would be departing. According to two former Pimco heads, Sneider felt that the working environment was increasingly difficult in the past 18 months, and that Gross’ behaviour had become “increasingly illogical and irrational.”
