ING IM extends universe for Asia-Pacific high dividend fund


On 17 October, ING Investment Management announced the launch of the ING (L) Emerging Market High Dividend Fund, which will inherit the ISIN Code of the ING Invest Asia Pacific High Dividend fund (LU0300631982). The migration will be accompanied by an enlargement of the universe of the fund and a change of managers.The UCITS-compliant fund (whose launch had been planned; see Newsmanagers of 9 June) will be managed by Manu Vendenbulck (senior investment manager) and Nicolas Simar (head of the high dividend team at ING IM). It was previously managed by Pranay Gupta and Bing Li. The fund is not yet on sale in France, but has received sales licenses for Germany and the United Kingdom.The actively-managed fund may now invest in all emerging markets, rather than being limited to Asia-Pacific, as previously. It focuses on businesses which deliver high dividends, and is inspired by the closed fund ING Emerging Markets High Dividend Equity, launched this year by ING IM in the United States, which attracted USD385bn in assets. The objective for the new fund is to outperform the MSCI Emerging Markets index by at least 100 basis points, with low volatility and limited risk of loss. The original Asia-Pacific fund was managed in Asia with a quantitative methodology. It will now apply the high dividend strategy of the team dedicated to this theme.
