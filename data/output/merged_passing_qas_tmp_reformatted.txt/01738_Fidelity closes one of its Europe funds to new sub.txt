Fidelity closes one of its Europe funds to new subscriptions


Citywire reports that the management firm Fidelity has closed its FAST Europe fund to new investments, due to the volume of assets in the fund (USD2.5bn). The decision was taken in order to prevent deposits from new investors from having a negative impact on the fundâ€™s strategy. The fund, managed by Anas Chakra, uses derivative products and leverage to improve performance. In the past three years, FAST Europe has posted gains of 7.2%, compared with losses of 21.1% for the MSCI Europe index.
