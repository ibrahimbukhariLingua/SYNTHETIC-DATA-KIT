Hermès/LVMH: minority shareholder defence organisation will appeal AMF decision


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The French Association for the Defence of Minority Shareholders (ADAM) will appeal a decision by the French financial market regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), to grant a special dispensation to the usual takeover regulations for family shareholders in Hermès defending themselves against LVMH. Colette Neuville, president of ADAM, has told Reuters that she will file the appeal by Monday, 17 January. The appeal does not come as a surprise, as the ADAM president had already stated on several occasions that she opposed any exceptions under the law. “The appeal will be filed within six days, as regulations stipulate,” says Neuville, adding that the six-day period counts from last Thursday, when the AMF granted its clearance to Hermès. Neuville, who challenges the “reclassification” arguments used by the AMF, claims that the case “poses the problem of the value of regulated information” published by the Hermès directors, who had always claimed in the documents they supplied to the regulator and to the market that there were no shareholders who singularly or collectively controlled the capital of the company.
