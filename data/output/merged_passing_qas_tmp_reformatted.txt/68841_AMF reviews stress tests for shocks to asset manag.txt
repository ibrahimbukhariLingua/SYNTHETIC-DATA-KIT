AMF reviews stress tests for shocks to asset management industry


Since the financial crisis of 2008, authorities’ use of exercises to evaluate the ability of supervised companies to overcome schocks has become an institutional fact n the banking sector. These stress tese carried out on a sector, a market or the entire financial secorr naturally interest the market authorities. That is especially the case in the field of asset management, where the capacity of attenuate or amplify shocks for the entire industry remains debated. That is why the French financial authority, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), has performed an initial survey of studies this kind of the asset management industry, to analyse methods used (entitled «Macro stress tests: quelle portée pour les marchés et la gestion d’actifs?»).The study finds that these studies vary from one to the next. However, two man categories of tests can be seen: on the one hand, tests carried out on an entity-by-entity basis by authorities with relevant data, or in association with the entities themselves, with results then aggregated to give an overall view of the overall impact to the financial system (bottom-up); on the other hand, tests based on a top-down approach of interactions of actors and market dynamics (fire sales or potential contagion phenomena).In the short term, to the extent that the availability of data and the ability to model interactions and dynamics linit the relevance of top-down approaches, the results of the first attempts must be interpreted with prudence. Their development will apparently involve acedemic research. In the meanwhile, more targeted bottom-up studies are useful.To drive reflection in this area, the study advances several proposals to improve macro stress tests, particularly bottom-up type exercises taking the specificities of asset management into account.
