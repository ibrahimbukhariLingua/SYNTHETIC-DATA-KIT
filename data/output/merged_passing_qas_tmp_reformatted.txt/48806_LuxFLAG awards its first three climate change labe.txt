LuxFLAG awards its first three climate change labels


LuxFLAG, the Luxembourg Finance Labelling Agency, announces that East Capital China Environmental, Green for Growth Fund Southeast Europe and NSF Climate Change+ Fund are the first three investment funds that have been awarded the LuxFLAG Climate Finance Label. In September this year, LuxFLAG has launched its Climate Finance Label with the aim to set a transparent environment for Climate Finance investments and unlock capital from institutional and private investors in order to help finance climate change action. One of the primary eligibility criteria of the Climate Finance Label is that the applicant fundâ€™s investments must be in mitigation and/or adaptation of climate change or crosscutting activities for at least 75% of total assets. The label is available to regulated UCITS and AIFMD funds domiciled in any EU country or subject to an EU equivalent supervision. Furthermore, two investment funds have been granted the ESG Label for the first time: BNP Paribas L1 Smart Food and Parvest Smart Food. Maj Invest Financial Inclusion Fund II K/S has been granted the Microfinance Label for the first time. Jupiter Global Ecology Growth has been granted the Environment Label for the first time. LuxFLAG renewed the Microfinance Label for two funds: BlueOrchard Microfinance Fund and Microfinance Initiative for Asia. LuxFLAG renewed the Environment Label for six funds: BNP Paribas Aqua, BNP Paribas L1 Equity World Aqua, Parvest Aqua, Parvest Environmental Opportunities (to be renamed Parvest Climate Impact), Parvest Global Environment and Parvest Green Tigers. LuxFLAG has issued 58 investment fund labels (30 Microfinance, 11 Environment, 14 ESG, 3 Climate Finance funds) worth over EUR 13.5 billion assets under management.
