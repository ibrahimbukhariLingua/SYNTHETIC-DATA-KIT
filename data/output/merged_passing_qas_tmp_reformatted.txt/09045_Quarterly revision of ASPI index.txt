Quarterly revision of ASPI index


Only one change has been made as part of the quarterly revision of the ASPI Eurozone index, which includes the 120 best-rated companies in the Euro zone on the basis of Vigeo ratings. Ordinary shares in Volkswagen (DE0007664005) will be replaced in the Euro Stoxx benchmark index on 22 March 2010 by preferential shares in Volkswagen (DE0007664039), at a quarterly revision of the index. As a result, the shares will also be replaced in the ASPI EurozoneÂ® index the same day, Vigeo announced yesterday in a statement.
