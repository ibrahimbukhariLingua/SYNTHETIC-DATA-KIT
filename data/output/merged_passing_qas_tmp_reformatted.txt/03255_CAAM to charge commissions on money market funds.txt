CAAM to charge commissions on money market funds


Cr√©dit Agricole Asset Management is reportedly planning to charge performance commissions for traditional money market funds aimed at institutional investors of about 50% on the outperformance over the Eonia. To offset the poor performance of money market investments, portfolios will take on short-term bonds, as some enhenced money market Sicav funds were doing before the crisis.
