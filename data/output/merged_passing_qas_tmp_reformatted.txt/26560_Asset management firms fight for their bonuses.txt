Asset management firms fight for their bonuses


Asset management firms are vigorously combatting proposed restrictions on their bonuses, according to a document obtained by FTfm. EFAMA proposes that managers should be able to receive three quarters of their bonuses in the year they were awarded, rather than only 60%, as suggested by the European Commission. The Efama amendment will be studied at a meeting of the European Council working group on UCITS V, scheduled for Monday.
