Barack Obama may tax high-risk financial investments


For the first time, the Wall Street Journal reports, US president Barack Obama has mentioned the possibility that the US government may impose a tax on financial sector businesses involved in “far-out transactions,” to protect taxpayers against the risk of bailing these firms out in the future. The tax may be inspired by the fees which more than 8,000 banks pay to the FDIC to guarantee their deposits. The president stated that the charges may apply to transactions which the government wants to discourage.
