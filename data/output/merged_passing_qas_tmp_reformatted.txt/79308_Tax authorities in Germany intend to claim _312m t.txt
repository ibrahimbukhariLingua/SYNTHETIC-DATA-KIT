Tax authorities in Germany intend to claim €312m to Caceis


Credit Agricole SA said on Wednesday the tax authorities in Germany’s Bavaria intend to claim €312min dividend tax refunds made to customers of its local custodian unit. " No intentional fault or negligence by Caceis Germany would be alleged to substantiate this claim. (...) Caceis Germany would strongly challenge this claim, which it finds to be wholly unfounded, should such claim be addressed to it», said the bank in a statement, adding it had not «benefited from these reimbursements carried out to the benefit of its customers. Caceis has decided not to book a provision of this amount».
