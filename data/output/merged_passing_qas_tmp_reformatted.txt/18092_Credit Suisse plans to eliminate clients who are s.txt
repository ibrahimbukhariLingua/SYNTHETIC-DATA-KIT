Credit Suisse plans to eliminate clients who are skilled in tax fraud


Credit Suisse is seeking to eliminate tax evaders from its client base, says Urs Rohner, chairman of the board of directors at the bank, in an interview with the Swiss-German newspaper Tages Anzeiger. It is clear that accepting tax evaders cannot be a business model for the future, the head of the bank says, when asked about the tax treaty concluded between Germany and Switzerland. The treaty, which stipulates taxation for undeclared funds in Switzerland belonging to German taxpayers, but preserving their anonymity, will on Friday be referred to the upper house of the German legislature (Bundesrat) for ratification. In all likelihood, it will be rejected by representatives, most of whom are opposed to it on the grounds that the bill is too easy on tax evaders. If clients refuse to disclose these funds, the bank will clearly tell them that it has no desire to do business with them, Rohner adds. And as to older clients, who already have accounts at the bank containing undeclared funds, Credit Suisse will end its business relationships with them, the head of the bank says in substance.
