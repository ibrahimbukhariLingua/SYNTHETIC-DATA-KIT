BNP Paribas group well-prepared to face up to US sanctions


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Following the publication by the US authorities of an agreement signed to settle legal action against BNP Paribas SA due to transactions which contravened US laws, the French Authority de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution (ACPR) estimates that the BP Paribas group is well-armed to pay the sanctions, which include a global fine in the amount of USD8.9bn. As consolidated supervisor of the BNP Paribas group, the ACPR examined the situation at BNP Paribas, and found that “the group presents an altogether solid solvency and liquidity situation, which will allow it to absorb the anticipated consequences of sanctions,” according to a statement released on 1 July. It also found that the organisations and the control mechanisms put in place are appropriate to the characteristics of its activities, including its international implantation. As a result, “the BNP Paribas group, with its licenses and authorizations unchanged, is thus permitted to continue its activities, in full respect of all applicable regulations.”
