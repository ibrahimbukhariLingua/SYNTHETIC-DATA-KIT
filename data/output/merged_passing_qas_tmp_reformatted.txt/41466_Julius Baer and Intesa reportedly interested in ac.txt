Julius Baer and Intesa reportedly interested in acquisition of BSI


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Several suitors have already declared an interest in acquiring the Ticino-based bank BSI, whose acquisition by the Brazilian financial group BTG Pactual was finalized barely three months ago, These include Julius Baer and the Italian firm Intesa Sanpaolo, according to reports on Sunday by Swiss RSI radio, based on sources familiar with the banking industry, the AWP agency reports. Over the weekend, several agencies reported a need for liquidity on the part of the BTG Pactual group, following the financial debacle which followed the arrest, on 25 November, and subsequent resignation of its head and primary shareholder, André Esteves, who is embroiled in the Petrobras scandal. When asked by RSI about the benefit which potential buyers may gain from an acquisition of BSI, professor Giovanni Barone Adesi of the Swiss Italian University (USI) notes that Julius Baer would be acquiring savings deposits in Switzerland. As for Intesa Sanpaolo, BSI could become “a center of excellence” in private banking activities for the group, the Ticino-based professor estimates.
