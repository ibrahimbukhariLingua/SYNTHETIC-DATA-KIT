EFG International no longer has any direct exposure to Greek debt


The Swiss private banking group EFG International on 6 June announced in a statement that its exposure to Greek debt now represents only 0.5% of its assets. Furthermore, EFG International committed to its regulator that it would not increase its exposure to Greece. Exposure has reduced to the point where EFG International no longer has any direct exposure to Greece, and exposure to European subsidiaries of Greek banks is just 0.3% of total assets. EFG points out that it has been driven to make these disclosures because “there have been a number of articles in the Swiss press which have shown a disregard for the facts. There have been suggestions that EFG International is particularly exposed to Greece, simply on account of the Greek heritage of its major shareholder and the fact that the latter had a substantial shareholding in a Greek commercial bank. This is completely without foundation,” EFG International says. EFG International operates in 30 locations worldwide, but is not present in Greece. EFG International is entirely separate from the Greek commercial bank, Eurobank EFG although it has a common major shareholder.
