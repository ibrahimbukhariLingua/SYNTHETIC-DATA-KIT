350 layoffs in the works at Legg Mason


According to the Daily Record, cited by Mutual Fund Wire, Legg Mason is planning to lay off 350 people in the next 6 to 18 months, of which 250 will be due to the closure of its offices in Owings Mills, in the suburbs of Baltimore. The layoffs represent 10% of total personnel. In an interview with the Baltimore Sun, the president & CEO, Mark Fetting, says that the job cuts will affect investment, invoicing, accounting and other back-office functions. At the conclusion of the process, Legg Mason will have only 550 employees in the Baltimore area, down from 1,000 in 2008.
