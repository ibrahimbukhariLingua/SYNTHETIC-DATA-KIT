Nobel prizewinners have harsh words for hedge funds


At the invitation of Pioneer (UniCredit), three American winners of the Nobel prize, Eric Maskin (2007), Michael Spence (2001) and Robert Merton (1997), on Wednesday and Thursday held debates in a palace near London, before an audience of European finance industry figures, on the future evolution of the architecture of the global financial system, Die Welt reports. Spence recommends that a stricter separation be drawn between banks and hedge funds, while Merton calls for increased risk controls, and says a central government authority needs to be created to monitor all risks. Maskin recommends that the use of derivatives, which distribute these risks potentially infinitely, should be limited, and adds that the use of CDS should also be limited.
