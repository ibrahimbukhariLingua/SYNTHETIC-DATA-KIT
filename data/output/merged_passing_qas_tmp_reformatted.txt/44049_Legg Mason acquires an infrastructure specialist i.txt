The activity, whose headquarters are located in Sydney, has offices in Melbourne, London and Chicago, and has USD7.6bn in assets under management for institutional and retail cients. The operation will allow Legg Mason to “extend its product range of liquid alternative investments, with the addition of the services of an experienced manager in a fast-growing assets class,” the firm says in a statement. Legg Mason is acquiring 75% of capital in RARE Infrastructure from its current shareholders, the Treasury Group and Northern Lights, for a total of AUD200m (USD146m, or EUR132m). The management of RARE Infrastructure will retain 15% of capital, while the Treasury Group will remain a minority shareholder, with 10% of capital. At the conclusion of the operation, which is expected to be finalised in fourth quarter 2015, RARE Infrastructure will operate as an independent affiliate, alongside Brandywine Global, ClearBridge Investments, Martin Currie, Permal Group, QS Investors, Royce and Associates and Western Asset Management, all affiliates of the Legg Mason group. Legg Mason is planning to accelerate the development of RARE Infrastructure, which already has a strong presence in Australia, Canada and Asia, in the US and European markets.
