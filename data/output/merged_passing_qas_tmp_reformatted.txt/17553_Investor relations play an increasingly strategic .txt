Investor relations play an increasingly strategic role in Europe


Heads of investor relations at a publicly-traded business are increasingly important. 65% of the time, this head reports directly to the chief financial officer, and 26% of the time to the CEO, according to an international survey of 140 heads of investor relationships undertaken by CA Cheuvreux, in partnership with investor relationship associations in France and Germany, CLIFF (the French investor relationship association) and DIRK (Deutsche Investor Relations Verband). Communications about sustainable development and management of relationships with bond investors/analysts are the primary current concerns of heads of investor relationships. The survey also finds that less than one out of every two investor relationship teams is responsible for sustainable development communications. Heads of investor relationships at mid-sizes businesses more often serve in complementary roles than their counterparts at larger market caps, primarily those of chief financial officer, head of management controls or communications. 85% of the time, heads of investor relationships are present at some meetings with the board of directors. However, only 12% participate in all meetings, and 3% are members of the board. 9 times out of 10, heads of investor relationships estimate that the importance of their role is duly recognised by the CEO and CFO as well as by financial analysts and investors. However, the responses are more nuanced for the auditing and advisory boards. Lastly, only one third of firms say they use social networks as communication tools. Twitter was the most frequently-cited, more often than LinkedIn.
