BlackRock to create a trading platform


BlackRock, which will soon become the worldâ€™s largest asset manager, with USD3,000bn under management after its acquisition of BGI, is preparing to create its own global trading platform, the Financial Times reveals, citing an internal memo. Minder Cheng has been appointed to oversee the platform. If some clients are selling a security and others are buying, BlackRock can cross these trades internally, without going through Wall Street. The service would be free of charge.
