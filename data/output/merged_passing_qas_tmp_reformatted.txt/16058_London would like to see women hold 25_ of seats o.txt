London would like to see women hold 25% of seats on boards at top FTSE companies


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Les Echos reports that a report commissioned by the British government recommends that the 100 companies of the FTSE index should have women occupying one quarter of the seats on their boards of directors by 2015. Quotas may be introduced if management fails to respect certain objectives. Currently, only five businesses of the FTSE 100, including Pearson, Burberry and Imperial Tobacco, have women as CEOs. Only one out of eight directors at FTSE 100 companies is a woman.
