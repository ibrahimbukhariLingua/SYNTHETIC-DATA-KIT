World - Brazil gives a boost to Latin America funds


Since the beginning of the year, equities funds specialised in Latin America have posted performance of 13.6%, largely due to their strong exposure to Brazil, Cinco Días reports. Brazil is benefiting from a rebound on commodity markets, high interest rates, and attractive growth outlooks. The Bovespa index has gained 7.86% since 1 January, and as much as 17.89%, counting currency effects. Funds which invest exclusively in Brazil are posting returns of near 20%. Félix López, a manager at Atlas Capital, says the rise of the Bovespa is due to the positive evolution of its two largest businesses, Petrobras and CVRD, which represent 32% of the index. In addition, Mercedes Camacho of IGF notes, Brazil has attracted inflows of capital due to the high interest rate differential.
