Koris moves into ratings of European ETFs


There is already Morningstar for ratings of actively-managed funds, and now there is Koris for passively-managed funds. The investment advising firm Koris International will this Monday, 8 June announce the launch of TrackInsight ratings of the 520 largest European ETFs. The ratings are being made available to professional investors at http://www.trackinsight.com/, an ETF comparison and selection platform.Unlike existing ratings systems based largely on qualitative analysis, the focus of Koris, which is also launching a new version of its website, is to be quantitative, transparent, and systematic. The Koris ratings system is based on a clear and public methodology, which establishes rankings based on the quality of replication by ETFs, to allow investors to quickly select the supports that best meet their needs.The ratings process includes all ETFs available on TrackInsight with at least 3 years of track record, and EUR50m in assets under management (which amount to 520 funds out of 650, as of 31 May 2015). The funds which satisfy these criteria have been broken down into 11 categories within the three major asset classes: equities, bonds, and commodities.The track records for the ETFs selected have been independently checked in advance by the teams at TrackInsight, and the ratings methodology is based on quantitative performance criteria with respect to the benchmark index. There are four criteria: tracking difference, volatility of tracking error, long-term persistance of differences in returns (Hurst coefficient), and lastly, the distance of extreme values in the distribution of returns (kurtosis).The funds with the best tracking difference and tracking error levels are also highlighted on the TrackInsight A-list.
