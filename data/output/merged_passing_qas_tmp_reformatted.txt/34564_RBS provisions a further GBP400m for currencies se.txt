RBS provisions a further GBP400m for currencies settlement


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Royal Bank of Scotland has written down a further provision of GBP400m, or more than EUR500m, to cover fines it may face at the conclusion of an investigation into suspected manipulation of currency markets. The bank on 31 October stated that further fines for illegal market behaviour would carve further into its profits. The group, in which the British government controls an 80% stake in capital after pumping in GBP45bn during the financial crisis, appears to be about to reach a negotiated settlement to a suspected currency manipulation case, similarly to other establishments.
