At least 30% of major actively-managed UCITS funds may infringe transparency rules


Many actively-managed UCITS funds still do not respect information transparency rules respecting benchmark indices, which must be included in the key investor information document (KIID). According to research by the Better Finance association, the European federation of users of financial services, nearly 30% of UCITS format actively-managed funds (a total of over 2,000) do not meet the information requirements concerning indices.A large part of the recalcitrant funds are domiciled in Luxembourg, with 43% of 272 equity funds. In total, Better Finance reports, 82% of all funds with faults are based in Luxembourg, the United Kingdom or Ireland. Only 1% of faulty UCITS funds are domiciled in France. Better Finance also reports that 145 funds explicitly indicate in their KIID documents that the fund is not managed with reference to a benchmark index, which, at the least, is not in keeping with the establishment of a public database which lists a reference index for all of these funds.“These persistent and very frequent violations of the rules of the European Union concerning investor protection, require a fresh appeal to the European public authorities to stop these damaging practices to European savers and investors as soon as possible, particularly in light of the current debate over the need for reform of the European financial supervision system,” says Guillaume Prache, CEO of Better Finance.The European Federation also says that it is surprised at the inaction of Brussels, as it already alerted European regulators to shortfalls in regulations, slightly over one year ago, at the time of its study of funds which claimed to be actively-managed. Since that date, only the British regulator (FCA) has forced 64 falsely active funds domiciled in the United Kingdom to bring their practices into line with regulations.
