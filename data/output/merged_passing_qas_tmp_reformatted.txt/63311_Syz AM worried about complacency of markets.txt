Syz AM worried about complacency of markets


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } In its note for February, the asset allocation team at Syz Asset Management concedes that the global economy overall can expect to see its positive growth dynamic improve, but says that it is worried by “high valuations in equity and credit markets, particularly in the high yield segment, which has not seen any correction in recent months.Contrary to the current widespread complacency, we are choosing to take the bullet out of the barrel by reducing our global expoosure to risk.” The team is thus moving “from a slight appetite to a slight aversion” to risk. The firm states that it is retaining some positions targeted to a rally on equity markets, which retain potential for further rises due to valuations and conjuncture, though their outperformance may now be less highly visible than it has been in the past few months. It also notes that selected positions on emerging market debt, with Mexico and Turkey earning honourable mention, and an exposure to duration via US Treasury bonds, are beginning to offer some potential both in terms of valuations and in terms of portfolio construction. “After buying by the book, we are now opting to lighten up our positions up as the Trumpets sound,” the note concludes.
