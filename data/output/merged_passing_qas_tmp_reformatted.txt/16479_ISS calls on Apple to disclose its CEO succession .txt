ISS calls on Apple to disclose its CEO succession plans


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The general shareholders’ meeting voting agency ISS claims that Apple Inc should disclose its plans for succession to the position of CEO Steve Jobs, who in January announced his second leave of absence on health grounds in two years, the Wall Street Journal reports. According to ISS, this would not require Apple to reveal the name of the people up to succeed Jobs, but the group should at least accept a motion proposed by shareholders at the general shareholders’ meeting on 23 February to require the firm to indicate in writing what its policies in this area are. Apple has recommended that shareholders vote against the resolution.
