Hedge funds did not torpedo Santander and BBVA


According to documents obtained by the CNMV, hedge funds did not short shares in Santander and BBVA during the recent market tensions, despite the increased risk associated with Spanish government debt, Cinco DÃ­as reports. Short positions on these banks either held stable or were reduced: for example, they represent only 2.69% of capital in Banco Popular, compared with 7.29% at the height of the crisis in March 2009. Securities lending does not appear to reveal high levels of speculation either. For Santander, shares lent decreased between 5 January and 17 February to 767 million shares (9% of capital), from 1.8 billion. For BBVA, the volume of securities lent in the same period remained at a level equivalent to about 17% of capital.
