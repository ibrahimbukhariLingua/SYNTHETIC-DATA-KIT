World - ICGN calls for shareholdersâ€™ help in fight against corruption


Professional Pensions reports that the International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN), which includes institutional investors worth USD9.5trn, has called on shareholders to ensure that companies they invest in have put in place preventative and disciplinary structures to combat corruption. In the document, which includes a checklist, the ICGN also recommends that investors themselves set up the corresponding controls at their own organisations.
