Sycomore AM adds to range of SRI funds


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; }a:link { } Sycomore Asset Management is adding to its range of SRI funds, with the launch of Sycomore Happy@Work, a new vehicle centered on human capital. For the new fund, the asset management firm has identified three dimensions which favour thriving at work: quality of life at work, motivation, and responsibility. These three elements “improve the level of engagement of the employee and the employee’s sources of productivity,” says Cyril Charlot, founding partner and manager of the Sycomore Happy@Work fund. To manage the new vehicle, the management team will rely on performance indicators which are already integrated into its proprietary ESG research tool. It will comlpement its analysis with on-site investigations, which will in large part make it possible to measure employee satisfaction. Sycomore AM already has four open-ended funds and over EUR600m in assets under management in its SRI strategy.
