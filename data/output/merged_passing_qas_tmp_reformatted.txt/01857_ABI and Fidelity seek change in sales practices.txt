ABI and Fidelity seek change in sales practices


The Association of British Insurers and Fidelity International are calling for radical change in the way investment products are sold across Europe. The ABI will urge the European Commission to remove remuneration bias from the sale of retail investments and raise the level of professionalism in the industry. Fidelity is also calling on the Commission to make a distinction between “advisers” covering the whole of the market and “salesmen” offering a limited suite of in-house products.
