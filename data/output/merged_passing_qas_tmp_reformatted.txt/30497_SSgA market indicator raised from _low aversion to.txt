SSgA market indicator raised from “low aversion to risk” to “normal”


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In first quarter 2013, the Market Regime Indicator (MRI) published by State Street Global Advisors was raised from a level of “low aversion to risk” to a “normal level.” This macroeconomic indicator developed by the Investment Solutions team at SSgA is used to identify the level of aversion to risk on several markets, and its levels help to determine investors’ appetite for risk. The MRI level is calculated on the basis of the implicit volatility of equities, the volatility of currencies and spreads on fixed income. “First quarter 2013 brought a succession of major political events. The devaluation of the Japanese yen, the Cypriot crisis, and the lack of political stability in Italy had a direct impact on the markets,” SSgA commented.
