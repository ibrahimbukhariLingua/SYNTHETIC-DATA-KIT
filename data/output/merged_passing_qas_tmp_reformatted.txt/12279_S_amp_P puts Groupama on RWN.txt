S&amp;P puts Groupama on RWN


The financial ratings agency Standard & Poor’s on 13 September announced that it has placed its BBB+ rating for Groupama on a watch with negative outlook.The ratings agency is concerned about the fact that the firm has not yet begun its program to reduce the sensitivity of its exposure to equities, which totalled 16% of investments as of the end of 2010. Standard & Poor’s estimates that credit risk has increased due to the group’s significant exposure to government bonds, particularly Greek and Portuguese bonds.
