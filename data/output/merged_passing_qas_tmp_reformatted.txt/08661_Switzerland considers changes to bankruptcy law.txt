Switzerland considers changes to bankruptcy law


The Swiss government on 22 April published an interim report by the group of experts assigned the task of examining ways to limit risks at major businesses which could endanger the economy, i.e. the “too big to fail” problem. The commission found that the problem exists in Switzerland only in the financial sector, and within the financial sector, mostly in the case of the two major Swiss banking groups, UBS and Credit Suisse. In addition to measures which would largely focus on owners’ equity requirements, liquidity, and the distribution of risk, the expert commission proposes changes to bankruptcy law. The federal council will now submit the proposals, which largely deal with improvements to the liquidation and unwinding of bankrupt financial establishments, to the Swiss parliament ahead of the summer holidays. The changes would simplify the continued payment of benefits to clients of bankrupt banks, from accounts which would be isolated by a transfer to a third-party bank or to a “bridge bank.” Foreign bankruptcy procedures would also be made more easily acceptable under Swiss law. The report also raises questions about the need to introduce added legislation which would require the continued operation of important systemic functions. The experts claim that the creation of a bankruptcy law, or at least the harmonization of this law internationally, would allow for a smoother liquidation of the major multinational groups with complex financial imbrications. The commission will this fall publish a final report which will include recommendations on a range of measures which would address the problem of corporations which are “too big to fail.”
