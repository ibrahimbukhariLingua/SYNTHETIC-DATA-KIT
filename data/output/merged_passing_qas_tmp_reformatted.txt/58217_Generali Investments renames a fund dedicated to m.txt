Generali Investments renames a fund dedicated to midcaps


Generali Investments is cleaning house in its product range. Ten years after its launch, the Generali Investments Sicav (GIS) Euro Equity Mid Cap fund has changed name, to become GIS Euro Future Leaders, the asset management firm has announced at a press conference. The name change is a sign that “the final fate of the fund is not to invest in midcaps but in companies which will become leaders of tomorrow in 10 years,” explains Eric Miassette, head of thematic equity management at Generali Investments. The name change, which takes effect from 18 September 2017, also aims to reflect “the objective and investment philosophy of the sub-fund,” which is to invest “in euro zone companies which offer the most attractive growth outlooks and which are valued at their fair value,” the asset manager adds.As part of this investment approach, Generali Investments will select companies “out of a universe of 1,500 European stocks whose market capitalisation totals between EUR500m and EUR5bn,” says Miassette. “The management team will select stocks taking five criteria into account: an attractive profession with barriers to entry; significant potential for growth that depends less on macroeconomic trends; strong generation of free cash flow, a solid management track record; and lastly, attractive valuation on the basis of a proprietary model.The portfolio of the fund currently includes 60 to 70 stocks. The GIS Euro Future Leaders fund now has about EUR600m in assets under management. The thematic equity management unit relies on a team of seven analysts/managers specialised in sectors and themes. As of the end of September 2017, the activity has a total of over EUR2bn in assets under management.
