Managers will now have a single point of entry to facilitate access to a local and cross-border network for distribution of their funds in Europe and Asia. The expert unit, located in Luxembourg, is composed of a multilingual team specialised in the construction of UCITS and alternative funds, and offers a solution to assist the local representative with distribution of funds in 14 countries. The option includes five local representative components: access to the market, management of fund registrations, administrative and legal support, monitoring of requests from investors, and monitoring of information from the local market. SGSS fills a role as ongoing co-ordinator with its various local agents, and also provides consolidated vision of fund activities, for better steering of distribution.
