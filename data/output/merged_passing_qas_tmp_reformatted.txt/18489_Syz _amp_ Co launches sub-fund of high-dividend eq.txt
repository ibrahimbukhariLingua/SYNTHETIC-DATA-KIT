Syz &amp; Co launches sub-fund of high-dividend equities


Syz & Co has announced the launch of Oyster Global High Dividend, a new sub-fund of its UCITS IV-compliant Luxembourg Sicav Oyster, investing in equities that pay a high dividend worldwide. The sub-fund will be managed by Roberto Magnatantini at SYZ Asset Management, and combined quantitative and fundamental analysis, with a particular emphasis on growth in dividends. “At a time when returns from dividends are often higher than bond returns, this type of strategy is increasingly attractive,” Syz&Co points out. For the moment, Oyster Global High Dividend is limited solely to institutional clients, but may soon be registered in several countries in Europe and Asia to become available to the public, a statement says.
