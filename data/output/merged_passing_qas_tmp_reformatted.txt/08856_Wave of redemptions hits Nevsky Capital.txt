Wave of redemptions hits Nevsky Capital


Nevsky Capital, the USD7bn London hedge fund manager, was hit last week by more than USD1bn of redemption requests from investors seeking to leave its flagship hedge fund, Nevsky Fund. The outflows follow the disclosure that Martin Taylor and Nick Barnes, the fund’s two star managers, were planning to step down next spring, says the Financial Times. In a letter to investors, the fund’s directors said the fund was unlikely to continue after the pair left.
