Sal. Oppenheim priced one third lower than previous estimates


According to sources familiar with the matter, the activities of Sal. Oppenheim to be taken over by Deutsche Bank may be worth only EUR1bn, though a price of EUR1.5bn was previously being mentioned for the Luxembourg-based firm stripped of its investment bank, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. This is due to the fact that tier one equity at Sal. Oppenheim is said to have fallen to EUR1.8bn from EUR2.1bn in spring, due to losses on loans, the firmâ€™s stakes (particularly in Arcandor), and its securities portfolio. The transaction may be completed by the end of the month. Family shareholders at Sal. Oppenheim will retain about 25% of the bank, which will limit its activities to family offices, open-ended funds, institutional funds, charities, and foreign affiliates. It is not yet known if stakes held by the owning families will be involved in the transaction: this is particularly true of custody activities at BHF-Bank and for funds of funds from Oppenheim Private Equity Partners.
