Credit Suisse chairman wants to resolve tax dispute with United States


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The chairman of the board of directors at Credit Suisse, Urs Rohner, is calling for a resolution to the tax crisis with the United States. “The question needs to receive a global response, there is no doubt, since UBS has already reached an agreement with the US authorities,” the banker explains in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung newspaper. Rohner estimates that reaching a painful solution for everyone will always be preferable to remaining stuck in the past. “It is unrealistic to think that banks can continue to avoid the problem in the long term and that it will eventually solve itself,” the chief administrator of Credit Suisse says. In addition to the aspect of conflict between the Swiss banks and Washington, Rohner points to a real rise in awareness in the sector. “Tolerance of tax crimes has taken a fundamental turn. The business model of accepting undeclared money is now economically senseless and morally unacceptable,” he added. In the event that it is impossible to reach a global solution, the chairman of Credit Suisse would not advise his colleagues to reach case-by-case agreements. “but the idea, which remains popular, that the problem is limited to 13 establishments and that the others are only marginally concerned is simply false,” he pointed out.
