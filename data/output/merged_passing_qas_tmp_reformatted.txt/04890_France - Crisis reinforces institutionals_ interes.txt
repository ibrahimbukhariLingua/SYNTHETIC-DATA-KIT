France - Crisis reinforces institutionals’ interest in SRI


The current crisis will strengthen the interest of institutional investors in socially responsible investment in the years to come. 86% of these investors share this opinion, according to a survey undertaken in January by Seeds Finance for Sparinvest for 39 directors of investment or heads of investment at French institutionals representing more than EUR300bn in assets. When words come to deeds, the candidates are more numerous, but all the same, 71% of respondents estimate that the crisis will strengthen interest in SRI, particularly in their own portfolios. Commenting on the results of this study in Paris on Thursday, Ulrika Hasselgren, founder and CEO of Ethix, an SRI advising firm based in Stockholm, estimates that this more marked interest can generally be explained by the fact that the crisis has thrown harsh light on poor business practices. She says ?the crisis represents an occasion for investors to found a new, more sustainable form of investment.? Currently, 56% of institutions or firms surveyed have an SRI attitude in general. Within financial management specifically, 45% of respondents said they have integrated SRI into their investment and manager selection process. But not all of them are involved in the same way. On one side, there are the ?timid? ones, says Benoît Schouler, CEO of Sparinvest in France, for whom SRI represents less than 1% of overall allocation (this category represents 35% of the population). On the other hand, there are the ?involved? ones, who have more than 10% of their portfolios in SRI (24%).Ways of investing also differ, according to investors. 32% use a ?sustainable development, new themes? approach, while the ?best in class? and ESG approaches are preferred by 22% of respondents. The last lesson of the study is that 95% of investors are sensitive to the quality of reporting on extrafinancial variables when they select an SRI fund.
