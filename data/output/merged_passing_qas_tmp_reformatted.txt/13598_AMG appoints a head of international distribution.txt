AMG appoints a head of international distribution


The Massachusetts-based group Affiliated Managers Group, or AMG, has appointed Andrew Dyson as its executive vice president and head of international distribution, a newly-created position. Dyson will be based in London, and will report to Nathaniel Dalton, president and chief operating officer of AMG. Dyson previously worked at BlackRock, where he was in charge of international institutional clients. AMG, which controls about 27 management boutiques, with assets under management totalling about USD340bn as of 31 March, is seeking to grow in the Asia-Pacific region. AMG has reduced its exposure to developed markets equities to 29%, compared with 35% in September 2010. However, the group has increased its exposure to emerging markets equities to 12%, up from 10% previously. Exposure to alternative management totals 30%, while the bond allocation represents only 1% of the total portfolio.
