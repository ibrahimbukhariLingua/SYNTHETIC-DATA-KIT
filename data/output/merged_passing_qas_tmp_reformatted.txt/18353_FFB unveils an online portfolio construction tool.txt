FFB unveils an online portfolio construction tool


Shortly after Fidelity Worldwide Investments unveiled its SAM portfolio management software (see Newsmanagers of 9 November), its affiliate FFB (FIL Fondsbank) has announced the launch of an online resource on which SAM is based, the Modellportfolio-Tool. The tool offers an integrated solution available on the website of FFB, which allows IFAs and wealth managers to easily and automatically deploy their own management strategies. With the tool, the portfolios of several clients whose expectations are similar could be administered in a centralised manner.
