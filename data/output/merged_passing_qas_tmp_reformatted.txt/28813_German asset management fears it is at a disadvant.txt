German asset management fears it is at a disadvantage in Europe


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Thomas Richter, CEO of the German BVI association of asset management firms, is concerned that regulatory texts currently under debate by the European Parliament does not treat funds, certificates, home loans and life insurance equally, the Börsen-Zeitung reports.The association is critical of the current form of the IMD 2 directive, since it plans to regulate the distribution of insurance products less strictly than the European Commission proposes.For the PRIPS product information directive, Richter regrets that national governments are attempting to remove capitalisation life insurance from the field of application of the text.Although the BVI approved the Commission’s proposals to create a new ELTIF format for European long-term funds in principle, Richter claims that the formula is not attractive enough to invetors, ELTIF is costly and complicated to launch, and investors are not allowed to withdraw before the end of the fund, which will limit demand, making it no more than a niche product.
