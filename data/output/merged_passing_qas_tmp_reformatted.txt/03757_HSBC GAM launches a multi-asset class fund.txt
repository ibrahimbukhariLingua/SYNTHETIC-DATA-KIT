HSBC GAM launches a multi-asset class fund


Babak Kiani and Christian MÃ¼ller-Goedecke (co-head of portfolio management) are the managers of the new HSBC Trinkaus Multi Markets Select fund, launched by HSBC Global Asset Management (Deutschland), which will invest in five asset classes in addition to cash, largely via derivatives of shares in funds, CDS, ETS, and currency futures. The German-registered product, which may invest up to 100% of its assets in derivatives, aims for absolute returns of 5% per year, after fees. The selection process will occur in three stages to limit the risk of losses. After quantitative and selective stages, the portfolio is constructed with a horizon of one month, using an optimiser which takes into account the results of the two previous stages. The fund will only invest in asset classes which promise higher returns than the money markets. HSBC GAM Germany will charge a front-end fee of 5%, a 1% management commission, and a 20% performance commission on returns exceeding the 5% objective.
