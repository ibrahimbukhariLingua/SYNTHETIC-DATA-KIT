Normative exclusion may make SRI more credible, says Novethic


Normative exclusion, which consists in banning investments in businesses which violate international, social or environmental conventions, may help to make socially responsible investment more credible, a new study by Novethic which surveyed 30 French and northern European investors has found. “the practice makes it possible to exclude the most visible black sheep in portfolios,” explains Anne-Catherine Husson-Traore, CEO of Novethic. However, due to its limited impact on businesses, exclusion may be considered only a step in the direction of SRI in the strict sense. It is thus best suited to be associated with other practices (best-in-class, engagement), the authors of the study claim. Respondents in the Novethic study have eliminated an average of only 13 businesses from investment universes of 500 to 3,000 shares. Only severe and repeated violations without the introduction of corrective measures may lead to exclusion. In addition, the composition of lists varies from one investor to another. As a result, nearly three quarters of businesses are excluded by only one player participating in the study. The other limit of the practice is index-based management. Most businesses which are subject to normative exclusion are listed on most global indices, while an increasing proportion of institutional assets are allocated to passive management.
