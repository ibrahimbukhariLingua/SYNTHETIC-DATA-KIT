p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Deutsche Bank on 14 March announced that it has sold its twin office towers to a closed real estate investment fund from DWS. The German bank has reportedly been planning to sell its headquarters for several months (Newsmanagers of 6 December 2010). The sale price is expected to total about EUR600m, Deutsche Bank says in a statement.From mid-May, the DWS fund will be available exclusively to private investors at Deutsche Bank. The properties will continue to operate as the headquarters of the bank, which would like to remain the long-term tenant. The towers, which were already owned by a closed fund from 1984 to 2007, were bought back by Deutsche Bank for the purposes of renovation, including bringing the building into compliance with the most recent ecological standards, such as German DGNB certification.
