Congressional panel concerned over condition of small US banks


According to La Tribune, the Congressional Oversight Panel (COP) is concerned about the fragility of small banks whose bad loans were not repackaged as financial products, and which are therefore not eligible for the Treasury’s support program. Stress testing in spring covered only the 19 major banks, while the country has 7,900 other banking institutions. The COP is calling for a revised system to be put in place which would evaluate other banks in terms of their owners’ equity needs.
