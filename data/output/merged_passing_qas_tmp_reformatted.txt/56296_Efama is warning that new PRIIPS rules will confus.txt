Efama is warning that new PRIIPS rules will confuse and mislead investors


On 3 January 2018, the new PRIIPs rules will go live. Unfortunately, according to Efama, the representative association for the European investment management industry, “it is becoming clear, as firms apply the new EU rules in practice, that they will not achieve the desired objective. Instead, the new rules are threatening to cause serious investor detriment by mandating figures, particularly in relation to performance and costs, that will at best confuse investors and at worst mislead them”. “In short, the PRIIP KID risks forcing manufacturers to make claims for products that breach the fundamental principle that investor communication must be ‘clear, fair and not misleading’. The new methodology for calculating transaction costs will also produce confusing and unreliable figures”.Specifically, the methodology for calculating transaction costs and the new rules around future performance scenarios are fundamentally flawed. This in turn drastically challenges the ability of the PRIIP KID to assist investors in making good investment decisions - given both the value proposition (the fund’s projected performance) and the cost proposition are seriously skewed.
