First State divides First State Stewart


First State Investments will split its First State Stewart team, which manages a full range of Asia-Pacific, emerging market and global equities, into two, the Australian asset management firm announced on Tuesday. The decision was made in order to face «the burden of scale», which has led to the temporary closure of several funds. By dividing the teams into two smaller ones, First State hopes to give each one agility which the ensemble was beginning to lack.Two teams will be created. The first, renamed as Stewart Investors, will be based in Edinburgh, but will also have members in Singapore, London, and soon, Sydney. It will take over the mananagement of emerging markets, global and sustainable funds, and most of the Asia-Pacific funds; its assets will total USD34bn. The second team, FSS Asia, will be based in Hong Kong. It will manage the Asia Equity leaders, Asia Select, Far East Leaders, Greater China funds, and mandates invested by country, for USD23bn in assets. The FSS Asia team will also have members in Singapore and Edinburgh.The two teams will continue to belong to First State Investments, and will report to Mark Lanzberger, CEO.The changes will become effective on 1 July.
