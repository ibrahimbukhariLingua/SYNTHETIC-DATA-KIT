EFG International planning new acquisitions in 2019


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } The private bank EFG International may make new acquisitions in 2019. Before acquiring a new firm, the Swiss company will make an effort to “get the best” out of its merger with BSI, director Steve Jacobs says in an interview published on 25 April in Finanz und Wirtschaft. In the short term, organic growth remains a priority. “When the combined activity is fully consolidated and the cultures merged, EFG will try to growth through acquisition,” Jacobs, also managing partner of the Brazilian bank BTG Pactual, says. The private bank may be ready for such an operation in 2019, in line with the vision which the major shareholders share, namely BTG and the Latsis family. According to Jacobs, critical mass in private wealth management is currently at USD150bn in assets, and will be higher in the future. At the end of last year, EFG had assets of CHF142bn, or USD144bn at current rates.
