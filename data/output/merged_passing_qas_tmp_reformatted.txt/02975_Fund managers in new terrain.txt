Fund managers in new terrain


Brent Beardsley, a partner at Boston Consulting Group, estimates that most management firms are poorly prepared for an increasingly competitive environment in which it will be more difficult to turn a profit, the Wall Street Journal reports. Shrinking margins and slowing growth will reduce the distance between the winners and losers in the sector.Those with a competitive edge and whose business model is clearly defined will have the best chance of surviving. These appear to include Vanguard and Pimco (Allianz), the first of which is known for its inexpensive ETFs, and the second for its bond funds. Both have received subscriptions from investors fleeing active management in favour of safer or less expensive products. Strategic Insight reports that Vanguard led the pack for net subscriptions in January-May, with USD39.9bn, followed by Pimco, with USD23.4bn. JPMorgan ranks third with USD6.4bn.
