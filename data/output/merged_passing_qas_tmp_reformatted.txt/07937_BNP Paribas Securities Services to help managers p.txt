BNP Paribas Securities Services to help managers publish KID documentation


BNP Paribas Securities Services has announced the launch of complete reporting solutions for asset managers which comply with the UCITS IV-KID directive. As management firms are required by this directive to publish a two-page Key Investor Information Document (KID), in a non-technical style, BNP Paribas Securities Services will offer its clients the necessary tools to comply with this requirement. “Complete reporting solutions from BNP Paribas Securities Services include market risk and performance indicators, for simple as well as complex funds,” says a statement. They also present quantitative aspects (performance, fees, and risk), while qualitative aspects are left to the discretion of the management firm (description of the investment policy and objectives of the fund), using the interactive online tools of BNP Paribas Securities Services.
