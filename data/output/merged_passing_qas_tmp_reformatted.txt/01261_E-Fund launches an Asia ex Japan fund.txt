E-Fund launches an Asia ex Japan fund


Three days after attracting CNY19bn for an ETF feeder fund, E-Fund has announced the launch of an enhanced QDII fund on 7 December, which will be focused on Asia-Pacific ex Japan (the E-Fund Enhanced Asia-Pacific QDII Fund), consulting firm Z-Ben Advisors reported on Thursday, adding that there is a “reasonable” expectation that the new product will attract USD500m in subscriptions. However, in the space of a few days, the manager may attract as much as USD1bn in subscriptions, since the distributor for the product is the powerful ICBC network, and management commissions are only 150 basis points, below the 185 basis point price of other QDII products. Z-Ben also notes that E-Fund has not named a sub-advisor for the fund.
