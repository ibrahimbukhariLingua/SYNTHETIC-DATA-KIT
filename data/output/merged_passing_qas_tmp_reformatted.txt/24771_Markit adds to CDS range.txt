Markit adds to CDS range


The Markit group, specialised in financial information, on 17 January announced that it was adding to its CDS product range with the publication of a daily report on sensitivity, which will provide clients with information about relationships between CDS prices and other market variables. The new services, Markit CDS Sensitivities, will provide a way to evaluate the sensitivity of a CDS spread to fluctuations in interest rates and credit quality, among others.
