Double trouble for money market funds


Since January 2009, assets in US money market funds have fallen by USD1trn, to a total of USD2.8trn, due to the fact that interest rates are low, and equities performed well last year, the Wall Street Journal reports. Vanguard Group has even closed some of its funds, estimating that it could no longer profitably operate them in the current environment. In addition to those troubles, new rules imposed by the SEC in January to protect investors are making it even more difficult for funds. Generally, these rules require money market funds to retain higher levels of liquidity, and to restrict their investments in top-quality shares, while shortening the average time to maturity for securities in the portfolio. All of these things can only reduce returns. And to deliver returns of at the highest 0.2% to 0.25%, managers are now required to operate at a loss. For the client, it pays better to put money in savings accounts, which pay 4 to 5 times more in interest.
