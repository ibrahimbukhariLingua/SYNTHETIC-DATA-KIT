Jens Ehrhardt to handle several problems at once


In early 2009, all the funds by Jens Ehrhardt (head of DJE Kapital) had top ratings from Feri. As of 30 June, this remains true for only 57% of them, Handelsblatt reports. This is due to the fact that the Hamburg-based independent asset manager is highly oriented to equities. DJE now ranks 15th among 71 independent asset management firms in the rankings. It has lost ground since many of its rivals are doing better in the rankings by offering only their best funds, and focusing on highly specilised areas of expertise, while Jens Ehrhardtâ€™s prestige requires him to compete in all categories. In addition, Ehrhardt is 70 years old, and must prepare for a transition at the firm to his son Jan, 37.
