LGT front-runner for BHF acquisition


Financial Times Deutschland reports that LGT, the financial entity of the Principality of Liechtenstein, is favoured to take over BHF Bank, which Deutsche Bank has put up for sale. LGT is still in competition with the US investment funds Apollo and Permira, as well as with the Abu Dhabi sovereign fund (ADIC). The remaining candidates have until mid-October to examine the books at BHF, and a buyer may be named one month later.
