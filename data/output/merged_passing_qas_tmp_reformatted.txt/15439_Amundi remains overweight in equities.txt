Amundi remains overweight in equities


In its diversified portfolios, Amundi Asset Management “has been overweight in equities by several percentage points for the past six months,” and is planning to continue to prefer higher-risk assets. The management firm “is gradually reducing its overweight position on high-yield bonds,” Philippe Thurbide, head of research, strategy and analysis, stated on 23 March, adding that the firm has already been underweight in investment-grade corporate bonds for some time. In government bonds in particular, the French management firm is short on duration, due to continuing, yet evanescent prospects of a rise in inflation in western Europe, and more concrete dangers of rising prices in eastern Europe. Pascal Blanqué, deputy CEO and CIO of Amundi Group, adds that the management firm “is moving from credit to equities, particularly Euorpean equities, where valuations are currently attractive.” This slant towards European equities is leading symetrically to a reduction in the overweight exposure to emerging markets. In terms of Amundi’s product plans, Eric Turjeman, head of equities management in Paris, states clearly that the range is nearly complete in “all terrain,” and thus capable of satisfying any fluctuations in demand due to market evolution. But there might be additions to the range of minimum variance (minvar) products to control volatility, and «return» products.
