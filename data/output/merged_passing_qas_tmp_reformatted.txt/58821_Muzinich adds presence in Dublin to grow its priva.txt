Muzinich adds presence in Dublin to grow its private management unit


Muzinich & Co (Muzinich) is opening new horizons. The US asset management firm on 18 September announced that it is opening a new office in Dublin, Ireland. The asset management firm has appointed Howard Mahon to the newly-created position of Director of its pan-European private debt team. Mahon will be based in Dublin, and will work to develop private debt activities and to build a team dedicated to the Irish market. For this market, “private debt is a relatively recent segment, but growing fast,” Muzinich notes in a statement. “The objective for this asset class is to provide financing to Irish companies and SMEs in the form of senior debt, in single rounds and mezzanine, potentially combined with capital investment,” the asset management firm adds. Mahon had previously been a director and partner at the bank AIB, in the specialist finance unit, where he had worked mainly on providing subordinate and alternative debt to Irish companies and SMEs. Before that, he had been a part of the Corporate Finance division at Deloitte & Touche. The asset management frm states that its pan-European private debt activities count the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund among its investors. The sovereign development fund has a statutory mandate to make investments to support economic activity and jobs in Ireland.
