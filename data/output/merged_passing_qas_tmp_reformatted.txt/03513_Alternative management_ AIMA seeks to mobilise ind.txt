Alternative management: AIMA seeks to mobilise industry against draft directive


The international alternative management association AIMA is taking action to oppose a planned European directive on alternative management. “We are very concerned by the manner in which the European Commission directive was written,” the association says in a statement. The directive was composed in a very short span of time, without the Commission having taken time to consult on it. “There was very limited consultation with the industry, and we deplore that it was possible to propose measures that are poorly adapted to an industry as complex and diversified as ours,” the AIMA states. The association also regrets that the draft directive was not sent out to relevant international organisations, and that it was subject to strong political pressure. The association expresses surprise at the scale of the political discourse on the subject, while all the major reports on the financial crisis, following the Larosière report, unanimously find that hedge funds played only a very marginal role.
