AXA IM opens an office in Mexico


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Axa Investment Managers (Axa IM) has opened an office in Mexico, to cover a large part of Latin America. “We are still waiting for a license from the local regulator,” says Andrea Rossi, CEO, at a presentation of their results. “Officially, we are supposed to launch the activity on 1 May. This office will have 6 to 7 people, and we will set up a fixed income platform there. Initially, we will target exclusively institutional investors.” From this new office, Axa IM also hopes to be able to develop in Chile, where the firm already has an exclusive distributor, and in Peru and Colombia, three countries which have large pension funds. The opening of the new office represents a new step in the growth strategy of Axa IM, which is aiming to become “a global actor of reference,” according to Rossi. The initiative comes after a strong year in 2015 for the asset management firm. “Our results are still better than in 2014,” says Rossi. “2015 was an excellent year, a record year.” Last year, the firm earned record net inflows of EUR42bn, compared with EUR19bn in 2014, a leap of 120%. Driven by these record net inflows, assets under management rose 7% to a total of EUR669bn at the end of 2015. Thanks to this, Axa IM has seen its earnings increase 9% in one year, from EUR1.125bn in 2014 to EUR1.230bn in 2015. Last year, operating profits rose 11% to EUR234m, compared with EUR211m in 2014. Lastly, net profits were up sharply to EUR269m as of the end of 2015. On the strength of these results, Axa IM is planning to remain faithful to its growth strategy. “In 2016, we will continue to execute our strategy,” says Rossi. “We want to accelerate our growth in the United States and Asia, and we will continue to offer innovative products and solutions to our clients.”
