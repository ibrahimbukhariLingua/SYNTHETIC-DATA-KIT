Bill Ackman backpedals on Herbalife case


The manager of the hedge fund Pershing, Bill Ackman, bet USD1.5bn, or 15% of its total asets, on Herbalife. He short-sold the shares, betting the firm would go bankrupt, as he felt that the firm is an immense “Ponzi scheme.” But the rise in its share value has already cost him nearly one third of his bet, or USD500m in latent capital losses, Les Echos reports. This has weighed on the performance of Pershing, which lost 5% in third quarter, one of its worst declines. It has thus decided to retain only 60% of its short positions, and has also acquired long options on the firm.
