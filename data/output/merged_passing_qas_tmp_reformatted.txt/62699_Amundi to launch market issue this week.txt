Amundi to launch market issue this week


Amundi will this week launch a market issue to finance the acquisition of Pioneer, Agefi reports. “We will launch a capital increase, which will partially contribute to financing the operation,” Yves Perrier, CEO of Amundi, said at a press conference in Milan. The market issue will total EUR1.4bn, out of the EUR3.5bn cost of Pioneer. The Crédit Agricole group will participate to retain at least 70% of capital in Amundi. The remainder will be financed through cash at Amundi (EUR1.5bn) and debt (EUR600m).“The integration process is proceeding under excellent conditions,” the director says. Since the acquisition of Pioneer was announced in mid-December, a steering committee was formed in early January, and 23 working groups have been created. The objective is to have strategies in place for all professions and countries “within the next two years” in time for a closing slated for June.
