New offers for PRIIPS do not resolve anything, according to BVI


@page { size: 8.27in 11.69in; margin: 0.79in }p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent }Aconsultation document concerning the key information document (KID)to be required under PRIIPs regulations, published on 8 November bythe European supervisory authorities (ESAs), including the banking(EBA), insurance (Eiopa) and market (Esma) supervisers, does notanswer the questions of German managers. “With the proposals of theESAs, information shortfalls in the information documents forsubscribers to products covered by PRIIPs regulations are notresolved, and the two controversial issues are not addressed,” theGerman association of asset management professionals (BVI) says in astatement released on 12 November.Theconsutation document says nothing at all about the methods ofcalculating transaction costs, the BVI states. Scenarios (stressed,unfavourable, moderate, and favourable) used as a basis to calculateprojections of future performance also remain intact, while thetreatment of past data produces inaccurate results, the professionalassociation says. Consideration of a longer period will onlyaccentuate the observed tendencies, the BVI says.TheESAs have themselves admitted that the time periods are too short todevelop new calculation methods, the association says. Theassociation has renewed its calls to postpone the introduction of thePRIIPs-KID document, scheduled for January 2020, until January 2022.
