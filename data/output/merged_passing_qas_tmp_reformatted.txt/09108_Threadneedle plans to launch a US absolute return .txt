Threadneedle plans to launch a US absolute return fund


As Simon Davies, chairman of Threadneedle, announced in an interview with Newsmanagers on 15 March, the asset management firm is in the process of setting up a US long/short absolute return equities fund that will comply with UCITS III. The new product comes in response to requests from clients, and will give them access to the management firmâ€™s expertise in shorting, acquired by managing its 130/30 fund Threadneedle American Extended Alpha Fund.
