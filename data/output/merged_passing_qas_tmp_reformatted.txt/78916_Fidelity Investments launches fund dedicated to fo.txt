Fidelity Investments launches fund dedicated to founder-led companies


Fidelity Investments announced the launch of Fidelity Founders Fund (FIFNX), with retail and advisor share classes. Portfolio manager Dan Kelley will focus on investing primarily in companies where the founder is either a member of the senior management team or is on the company’s board of directors. Kelley will use fundamental and quantitative analysis to find what he believes to be mispriced investment opportunities as well as companies with strong earnings growth potential across the market cap spectrum. “Our research and experience shows us that founder-led companies tend to be more innovative, customer focused, and better generators of shareholder value than companies without founder engagement,” said Kelley. “However, not every founder is created equal, which is why conducting deep fundamental analysis and rigorous on-the-ground research is crucial in seeking to deliver the best long-term value to shareholders”, he added. Kelley is a 14-year Fidelity veteran and an 18-year industry veteran. He currently manages the Fidelity Puritan andFidelity Advisor Diversified Stock funds.
