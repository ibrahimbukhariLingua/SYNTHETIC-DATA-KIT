Luxembourg - Madoff: Regulator underscores responsibilities of depositary banks


In a statement published on 2 January, the Luxembourg financial sector surveillance commission (CSSF) addresses the Madoff scandal. Having defined the extent of the exposure of Luxembourg management firms and financial establishments to the Madoff fraud at the end of December, the regulator this time only goes so far as to point out the responsibilities of depositary banks in Luxembourg, where the Luxalpha Sicav is domiciled.?The CSSF would like to stress that the Luxembourg law applicable to Luxembourg based depositary banks in their role of safe-keepers of investment funds’ assets reflects faithfully the provisions of the European Council Directive 85/611/CEE on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities,? the statement says.?Thus, when a fund’s assets are deposited by the depository bank with a third party, these deposits are under the monitoring and supervisory responsibility of the depositary bank, implying that the latter must know at all times in which manner the assets are invested and where and how these assets are available. This responsibility is not affected by the fact that the depositary has entrusted to a third party all or part of the assets in its safe-keeping.?The regulator ?wishes to note that during the ongoing investigations in the Madoff case, the Commission does not limit its analysis to the depositary banks concerned but verifies that all the other parties involved with the funds concerned have acted with the diligence imposed by Luxembourg law.?
