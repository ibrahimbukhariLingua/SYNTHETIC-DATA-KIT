France’s AAA rating under threat


Moody’s warned France on 21 November that a sustained rise in its debt yields coupled with weakening economic growth could harm its ratings outlook, fuelling worries it could lose its AAA. «Elevated borrowing costs persisting for an extended period would amplify the fiscal challenges the French government faces amid a deteriorating growth outlook, with negative credit implications,» the rating agency says. In mid-October, Moody’s gave itself three months to study whether it would need to revise its “stable” outlook on the rating. The agency now says that “last week, the yield differential between French and German 10-year government bonds topped 200 basis points, a new euro-era high” The agency calculates that an increase of 100 basis points in yields would result in additional funding costs of billions of euros per year. “With a government projection of barely 1% growth in GNP in 2012, a more burdensome interest rate would make it more difficult to achieve deficit reduction targets,” Moody’s says.
