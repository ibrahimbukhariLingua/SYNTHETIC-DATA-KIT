Tracker funds cost more than actively-managed funds


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } British tracker funds, which have assets of over GBP6bn, have very uncompetitive annual fees, according to a study undertaken by Bestinvest, MoneyMarketing reports. Bestinvest finds that the annual fees for the major British tracker funds fell in a total range of 0.15% to 1.5%. The two largest British retail tracker funds are the Virgin UK Index tracking fund (GBP2.4bn in assets), whose annual fees total 1%, and the Legal & General (N) Tracker Trust fund (GBp1.2bn), whose annual fees are 1.15%. Bestinvest cites several other tracker funds, whose total annual fees range from 0.8% to 1.5%. Bestinvest estimates that such fee levels are excessively high and unnecessary. According to Ben Seager-Scott, a senior analyst at Bestinvest, “there is no reason to pay more than 0.4% per year in fees for a tracker or an ETF. What our research clearly shows is that despite the fact that these strategies are passive, it remains highly important to be active in the selection of funds when choosing a tracker fund.”
