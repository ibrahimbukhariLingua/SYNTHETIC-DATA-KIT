New captain at Pimco privileges teamwork


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } “Few people can replace Bill Gross. Daniel Ivascyn will not try,” the Wall Street Journal writes, in an article giving a portrait of the successor to the emblematic founder of Pimco. “The new structure is based on sharing responsibility,” Ivascyn explains in an interview with the newspaper. “We are moving from a structure driven by its founder to one which, in a word, values teamwork.” Ivascyn will not manage the Total Return fund, but will oversee it. He has a reputation as a mortgage securities trader, but is less well known for his ability to make calls on the basis of the economy like Gross, observers comment. Ivascyn was recruited 16 years ago by Gross. In the past few yeas, he attracted investors to the Pimco Income fund which he manages by achieving remarkable returns. Ivascyn, a native of Oxford, Massachusetts, is married and has several dogs. He led the expansion of the company into alternative strategies, and manages two hedge funds focused on banking assets.
