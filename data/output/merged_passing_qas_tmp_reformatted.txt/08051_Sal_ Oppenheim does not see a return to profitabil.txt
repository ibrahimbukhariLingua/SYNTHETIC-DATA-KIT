Sal. Oppenheim does not see a return to profitability in the near future


In its annual report, published on the website of the Bundesanzeiger (official gazette), Sal. Oppenheim states that it lost EUR1.27bn in 2009, compared with EUR163m the previous year. The private bank, which has been taken over by Deutsche Bank on 15 March 2010, says that it will be necessary to create new structures to generate growth and to return to profitability, which will involve a re-examination of back-office functions, in order to create synergies with Deutsche Bank. In particular, savings will be necessary in IT. The firm will now concentrate on wealth management for private clients, institutional management, and management of retail and institutional funds. Sal. Oppenheim predicts that it will return to profitability in two to three years. The 2010 accounts will be dragged down by one-time costs related to restructuring and the sale of assets owned directly by the bank. Further write-downs may be necessary for some credits, as well as investments in real estate. Operating profits, however, are expected to increase to a satisfactory level this year.
