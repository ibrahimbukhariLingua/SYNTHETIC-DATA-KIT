Launch of Carl Huttenlocherâ€™s hedge fund delayed


The Wall Street Journal reports that the Hong Kong Securities & Futures Commission (SFC) has received an anonymous complaint that Carl Huttenlocher and some of his colleagues incorrectly valued certain illiquid assets at the peak of the financial crisis, when they were working at Highbridge, a hedge fund management firm owned by JPMorgan. The SFC has opened an investigation, and is seeking further information, which has delayed the issuance of a hedge fund license for a fund that Huttenlocher, former CIO for Asia at Highbridge, was planning to launch.
