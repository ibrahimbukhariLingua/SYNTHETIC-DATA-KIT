Investment funds lose legal challenge against Porsche


A lawsuit filed by 26 hedge funds against the former board of directors of Porsche was dismissed by a court of appeals in New York on Thursday, 27 December due to a lack of grounds for prosecution, leading to a steep increase in the share price of Porsche the following morning on the Frankfurt stock exchange, Reuters reports. The funds in question had accused the German auto maker of causing them over USD1bn in losses due to manipulation of the Volkswagen share price.
