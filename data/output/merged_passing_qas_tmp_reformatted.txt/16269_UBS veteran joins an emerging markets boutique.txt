UBS veteran joins an emerging markets boutique


Marten S. Hoekstra, former CEO of UBS Wealth Management Americas, has joined Emerging Global Advisors, a US asset management company specializing in exposures to emerging markets, as chief executive officer. He assumes the CEO position from founder Robert Holderith, who will continue as president and concentrate on investment product development. Emerging Global Advisors is advisor to the EGShares family of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which target specific investment sectors or themes and allow investors access to more precise market exposures. The company currently manages nine emerging market ETF products offering exposures to the energy, financial, and mining and minerals sectors, emerging market consumers, and the respective infrastructures of Brazil, India, or China. Additional ETFs and other investment products are planned.
