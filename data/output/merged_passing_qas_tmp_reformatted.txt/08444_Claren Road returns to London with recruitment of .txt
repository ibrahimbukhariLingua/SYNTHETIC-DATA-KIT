Claren Road returns to London with recruitment of a Deutsche Bank head


Bloomberg reports that the New York management firm Claren Road Asset Management LLC has recruited John Aylward, head of high yield trading at Deutsche Bank, to reopen the firm’s City office, closed last year. A spokesperson for Deutsche Bank in London confirms the departure of Aylward. Aylward will be based in London, and will oversee the debt investments of Claren Road, which manages about USD3.7bn. Claren Road’s return to London comes as a surprising move at a time when the European Union is putting the finishing touches to its AIFM directive, which is leading some City hedge fund management firms to consider moving to Switzerland, Singapore and Hong Kong.
