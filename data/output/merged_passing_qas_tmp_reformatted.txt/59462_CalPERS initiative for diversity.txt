CalPERS initiative for diversity


The Californian pension fund CalPERS has announced that it has sent a letter to the 504 companies of the Russell 3000 index to invite them to promote diversity on their boards of directors. The letter points out that a growing number of studies finds that diversity on boards has a positive impact on the performance of companies. CalPERS consequently calls on companies to take measures to promote diversity and to publish their action plans to reduce the diversity deficit on their boards. CalPERS states that the 504 companies selected have been selected due to the limited diversity on their boards.“To put it simply, diversity on boards of directors is good for business. In the international economy of today, the expertise and knowledge necessary to meet complex economic needs,” says Anne Simpson, chief investment officer at CalPERS responsible for sustainable development.Over the next few months, CalPERS will closely monitor the progress made by companies on these diversity issues, and will make confidential arrangements if necessary. A lack of improvement in diversity will clearly have negative implications on the voting policies of the pension fund at general shareholders’ meetings. CalPERS and another pension fund, CalSTRS, have set up a “3D” database (Diverse Director DataSource), which aims to facilitate the search for talent to sit on boards of directors.
