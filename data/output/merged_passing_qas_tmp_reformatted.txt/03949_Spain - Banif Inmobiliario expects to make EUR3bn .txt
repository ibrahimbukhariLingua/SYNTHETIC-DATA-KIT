Spain - Banif Inmobiliario expects to make EUR3bn from sale of assets


Santander Real Estate, the management firm responsible for the open-ended real estate fund Santander Banif Inmobiliario, has selected CB Richard Ellis to advise it on a sale of assets from which it hopes to earn more than EUR3bn, according to sources close to the firm. Expansi√≥n calculates that the sale represents about 90% of total assets in the fund before redemptions were frozen (though the value of these assets has been revised downwards by 7.5%). The process of selling the properties will take at least two years.
