Role of FSA to be strengthened


The Financial Times reports that Alistair Darling is planning to unveil a new Banking Act this year, which will strengthen the role of the Financial Services Authority. The decision comes in the wake of criticism of the Bank of England for failing to react adequately to the banking crisis. The chancellor will assign the FSA a new mission of maintaining financial stability.
