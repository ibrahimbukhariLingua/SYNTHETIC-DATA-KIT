EU: Threadneedle preparing two more Newcits


In addition to the US equities fund US Absolute Alpha, announced in March (see Newsmanagers interview with Simon Davies on 15 March, and article on 16 March), Threadneedle has applied for, but has not yet received, licenses from the British authorities to sell two new absolute return funds that comply with the UCITS III directive. With the first of these products, the Absolute Emerging Market Macro Portfolio,Threadneedle is aiming for total returns, after fees, of 10-15%. The fund will be managed by Richard House. It will invest primarily in bonds and currencies from emerging countries. The second, Multi Asset Absolute Return, will be managed by Alex Lyle and Quentin Fitzsimmons, manager of the Target Return fund. The multi-asset class portfolio will be invested worldwide in equities, bonds, and currencies, directly or indirectly, as well as in commodities and real estate (non-physical), and/or in other asset classes. The performance objective will be 5-8%, after fees.
