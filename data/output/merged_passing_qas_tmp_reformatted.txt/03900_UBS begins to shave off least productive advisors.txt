UBS begins to shave off least productive advisors


According to sources close to the firm, cited by Dow Jones, UBS has begun to lay off financial advisors from its wealth management branch whose annual production is below USD250,000. In total, the Swiss group is planning to lay off about 2,000 employees in wealth management in the United States. This is the first time that layoffs have affected personnel whose income is entirely commission-based.
