Private banker founds his own wealth management firm


The former head of private banking at Banque Havilland, Nick Parker, has founded a wealth management firm, RiverPeak Wealth, Money Marketing reports. Before joining Banque Havilland, Parker was managing director of ultra-high net worth British clients at Citi Private Bank. According to Parker, â€œthere is no doubt that there is a niche in the market for a wealth manager with the style of a private banker, meaning a manager who is not content to offer outdated products but can provide high-level strategic services which are generally reserved only for ultra-high net worth clients.
