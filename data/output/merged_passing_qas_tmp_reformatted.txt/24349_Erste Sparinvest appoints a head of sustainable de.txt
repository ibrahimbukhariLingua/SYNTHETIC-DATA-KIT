Erste Sparinvest appoints a head of sustainable development


Wolfgang Pinner, who was already head of the sustainable investment team at Erste Sparinvest, has been appointed as Chief Sustainability Investment Officer. The Austrian asset management firm has assets of EUR630m in its sustainable investment funds, and Pinner will aim to develop cooperations with businesses and institutions in the sustainable development sector, to establish strategies for the exercise of voting rights at shareholdersâ€™ meetings, to develop key performance indicators, and to define exclusionary criteria. In this connection, Erste Sparinvest has also announced that since the beginning of this year, all of its actively-managed investment funds are barred from investing in businesses which are active in the area of weapons prohibited by the United Nations. To this end, Erste Sparinvest will rely on the assistance of the German ethical ratings firm oekom research.
