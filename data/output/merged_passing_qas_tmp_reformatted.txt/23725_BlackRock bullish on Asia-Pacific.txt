BlackRock bullish on Asia-Pacific


In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mark McCombe, chairman of BlackRock for Asia-Pacific, says the firm is “bullish” on the Chinese economy, as the Chinese government has done a good job of managing it centrally through times of numerous economic uncertainties, with the situation in Europe and structural issues in the United States. He is also bullish on India, due to the entrepreneurial spirit there, but its major challenge is infrastructure, and it will take time for the country to catch up with China in this area.McCombe says that he has always regarded Indonesia as a sleeping giant, which is now trying to overcome its structural problems. In Australia, the overactive economy actually reflects growth in inter-regional trade, and the fact that growth in China is advancing at a fast pitch, which means that China will need to find resources or partners capable of supplying it with commodities it needs, and Australia is in a position to be that partner.
