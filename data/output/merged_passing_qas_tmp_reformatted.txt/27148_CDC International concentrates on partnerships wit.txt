CDC International concentrates on partnerships with sovereign funds


Jean-Pierre Jouyet, CEO of the Caisse des dépôts group, has assigned Laurent Vigier to develop CDC International, accordint to a statement from CDC released on 30 September. Vigier, chairman and CEO of CDC International, will set up an ambitious strategy for the Group to attract sovereign funds and other major international institutional investors by investing by their side as a partner. The objective for the Caisse des Dépôts is to strongly help to attract foreign capital to multiple assets classes, for ongoing financing of the French economy and to sterngthen its competitiveness. CDC International had already allowed for a dense network of sovereign fund partners to be developed, and for the first long-term international business partnerships of the Caisse des Dépôts (Fonds Inframed et Marguerite, Fonds Franco-Chinois) to be created. The largest French firm dedicated exclusively to sovereign funds, the company will primarily aim to continue construction of bilateral investment vehicles with Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and the Russian Federation. It will manage the investments of the Caisse des Dépôts in these vehicles, and will be responsible for providing management of these investments. It will also be responsible for developing a multilateral investment platform in order to attract more sovereign capital more sustainably. CDC International thus becomes the Group’s resource for long-term investment in partnership with sovereign funds.
