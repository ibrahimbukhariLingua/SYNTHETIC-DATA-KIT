Anima planning merger with Aletti


The Italian asset management firm Anima Holding is planning to merge with its rival Aletti Gestielle, the firm announced on Monday.Anima has confirmed in the wake of a series of “indiscretions” in the Italian press, and at the request of the surveillance authorities, that there is “strategic interest in potential mergers with other asset management companies.” Anima states that a potential merger with Aletti Gestielle Sgr would be consistent with the main external growth guidelines in light of relationships between the two firms. “At the present time, preliminary talks are underway to check the feasibility of such an option,” Anima says.The Italian newspaper Il Sole – 24 Ore on Sunday reported that Banco BPM and Poste Italiane are seeking to build an Italian asset management unit out of Anima, in which they are both shareholders.A marriage of Anima with Aletti Gestielle, which is also part of the Banco BPM group, would represent the first step in its development, the Italian newspaper states.According to Il Sole 24 Ore, the Italian post would then integrate its own asset management firm, BancoPosta Fondi, into Anima.This would allow Anima to more than double its assets under management, from EUR75.1bn currently, to nearly EUR170bn. This would put the firm in fourth place in the Italian asset management sector, not far behind Pioneer-Amundi, which is hovering at about USD180bn.The Cassa Depositi e Prestiti is reported to be a participant in the project, with a 35% stake in Poste Italiane. It may acquire a stake of 10-15% in Anima, after the integration of BancoPosta Fondi.
