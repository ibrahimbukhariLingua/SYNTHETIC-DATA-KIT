Investor confidence severely dented


The month of May 2010 proved not so pretty, and rather severely calamitous, as it brought a serious setback for investor confidence in continued global growth and the capacity of businesses to prosper. The most recent survey by BofA Merrill Lynch, conducted between 4 and 10 June, which interviewed 207 managers at he head of about USD606bn in assets, finds that only 24% of respondents expect the global economy to improve in the course of the next twelve months, compared with 42% in May, and 61% in April. A similar evolution can be seen in predictions for corporate profits: 28% of respondents predict that these will improve, compared with 47% in May and 67% two months ago. Appetite for risk is still there, but investors are concerned about liquidity conditions on the market, as 42% of respondents call liquidity “mediocre,” compared with only 22% in April. Concerns about inflation have risen to the extent that 80% of managers surveyed rule out the possibility tht the fed will raise its rates in 2010. The study also finds that 38% of respondents estimate that equities are undervalued – the highest percentage since March 2009. The very poor predictions of investors for Europe seem to have reached bottom. One month ago, 30% of investors said they were planning to underweight the Euro zone first of all, while only 12% are planning to do so now. Investors are slightly more optimistic about European equities, and 19% of respondents predict that the Euro will gain value in the future, compared with 7% in May. However, European investors still have a highly morose morale. Only 7% predict that the economy will improve in the next 12 months, compared with 23% in May. Nearly 20% predict that profits will rise in the next twelve months, compared with 74% in April.
