Viret was previously director of sales at PhiTrust, and was previously head of institutional clients at Pioneer Investments France.Tobam, formerly Lehman Brothers AM, in which CalPERS has recently acquired a 17.5% stake with Strategic Investment Company, is specialised in anti-benchmark management, based on the principle that benchmark indices which are weighted by capitalisation are not adequately diversified, and that they tend to give excessive weight to shares and sectors whose share price is already high. As of the end of April, the firm managed EUR1.35bn in assets.
