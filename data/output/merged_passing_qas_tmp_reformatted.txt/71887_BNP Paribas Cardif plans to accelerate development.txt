BNP Paribas Cardif plans to accelerate development serving IFAs


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } As part of its development plan, BNP Paribas Cardif on 8 February announced that it has signed a partnership with Manymore to accelerate the digital transformation of its activities dedicated to independent financial advisers (IFAs) and brokers. From April 2018, these partnerships will gradually receive digital transformations for savings and retirement policies offered by BNP Paribas Cardif. The solution developed by the software developer Manymore for BNP Paribas Cardif will allow IFAs and brokers to simplify their workflows and accelerate processing of transactions. The solution will be compatible with all market aggregators, so that partners will benefit from the link between the consolidated vision of each client and the digital overview of policies offered by BNP Paribas Cardif. Processing of operations will be optimised with a “multi-device” interface, the implementation of electronic signatures, and greater traceability of payments. Cardif Elite will be the first life insurance policy to benefit from this digital workflow from April 2018.
