Bankinter launches a campaign to promote Lyxor ETFs


In all its branches in Spain, Bankinter will promote Lyxor ETFs, making it the first bank in the country to offer products of this type to retail investors, Funds People reports. Previously, only independent intermediaries such as Renta 4 and Inversis offered this type of fund to retail investors. Only BBVA and Lyxor Asset Management have listed ETFs on the Spanish stock exchange.
