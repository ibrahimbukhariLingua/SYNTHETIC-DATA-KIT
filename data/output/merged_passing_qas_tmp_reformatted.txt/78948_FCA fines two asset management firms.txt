FCA fines two asset management firms


British market watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), on 21 February announced that it has fined Hargreave Hale £306,300, and River and Mercantile Asset Management £108,600. The FCA has also announced that it has not fined Newton Investment Management, because that asset management firm agreed to assist the FCA with its investigation. Today’s announcement becomes the first to be published by the FCA under new competition law. The asset management firms fined by the FCA shared strategic information bilaterally about an initial public offering and a placement process, just before prices were set, a statement says.
