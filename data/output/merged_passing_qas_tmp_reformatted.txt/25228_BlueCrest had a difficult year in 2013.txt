BlueCrest had a difficult year in 2013


The hedge fund firm BlueCrest Capital Management, which had stood out favourably in the period following the crisis, has had a difficult year in 2013, the Wall Street Journal relates. The quantitative fund BlueTrend, led by Leda Braga, one of the highest-paid women in the hedge fund sector, has lost about 10% since the beginning of the year. The BlueCrest Capital International, managed by Michael Pratt, one of the founders of the firm, is flat for the year. Instead of withdrawing, BlueCrest borrowed money to buy back the stake in the firm held by its rival Man Group and to recruit to cover new areas such as equities. In New York the firm is moving into larger offices. But some investors are beginning to lose patience, and the inflows of new capital are slowing.
