The fund is targeting sectors ranging from healthy beverages to baby foods to alternative sources of protein and new ways of connecting with conumers who increasingly value local brands and traceability. “Our ambition is to invest in six to seven companies per year, and to have a portfolio that could reach 20 to 25 companies by 2020,” Laurent Marcel, CEO of Danone Manifesto Ventures, tells Reuters. The fund, based in New York and created in 2016, has already invested nearly half of its initial budget of USD150m. It has invested in Michel and Augustin cookies and deserts, Yooji frozen baby foods, Farmer’s Fridge bio snack and salad vending machines, and more recently, Kona Deep, a Hawaiian bottled springwater brand, and coconut milk brand Harmless Harvest.
