Regulations distort institutional asset allocations


A study undertaken by the Kommalpha agency for the German BVI association of asset management firms has found that 134 institutional investors surveyed (with assets totalling EUR380bn) would like to reduce their allocations to institutional funds specialised in fixed income products to 40%, from 60% currently, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports.When asked about the impact of regulations, they say that their allocation to government debt would fall to 9% from 18% currently if laws or regulations did not require them to invest in this asset class. They would also double their allocation to equities to 24%, and would increase their allocation to real estate funds, private equity and corporate bonds, to the detriment of government bonds, Pfandbriefe and liquid assets such as money market funds.
