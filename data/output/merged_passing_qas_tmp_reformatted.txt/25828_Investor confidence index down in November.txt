Investor confidence index down in November


State Street’s Global Investor Confidence Index fell to 91.3 in November, down 4.2 points from October’s revised reading of 95.5. «The decline was the result of a relatively steep fall off in European sentiment to 101.5 from a revised reading of 111.3 in October», observes State Street. Sentiment in both North America and Asia improved slightly over the month fueled by better economic news out of both regions. The North American ICI increased by 3.2 points to 89.4 over the revised October value of 86.2 and the Asian ICI rose 3.4 points to finish at 98.9 from an October revised value of 95.5.“Improved US economic data and consensus around the Yellen nomination implying delayed tapering seem to be leading to an uptick in North American investor confidence,” commented Ken Froot, one of the creators of the index. “Investors in the US are still aware of the challenges and overall confidence reflects this as sentiment has yet to return to a more neutral stance.”
