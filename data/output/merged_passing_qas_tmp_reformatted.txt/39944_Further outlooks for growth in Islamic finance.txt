Further outlooks for growth in Islamic finance


For Islamic finance, new prospects are opening now in North Africa, where regulatory changes are creating a favourable environment for growth in the sector, Standard & Poor’s states in a study published on 18 February entitled “Islamic Finance Could Make Inroads Into North Africa.” However, the growth of this asset class remains limited in this region, where it has yet to prove its added economic value. The competitiveness of Islamic banking products, compared with their conventional counterparts, will be one of the major determining elements in the success of these products in North Africa. After the Arab Spring, the importance of running deficits and a drop in conventional sources of financing, due to more difficult access to finance markets, have led the governments of countries concerned to examine the possibilities offered by Islamic finance. Standard & Poor’s is following these developments in the countries of North Africa, where it rates banks: Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco. These countries have recently takes mesaures to support the growth of Islamic finance. Tunisia and Egypt have set up new regulatory frameworks to issue Sukuk in 2013. Tunisia will issue one Sukuk, aims to attract a new category of investors. In January 2014, the Moroccan Council of Ministers passed a legal framework for Islamic banking operations, forming the foundations for the development of Islamic finance activities.
