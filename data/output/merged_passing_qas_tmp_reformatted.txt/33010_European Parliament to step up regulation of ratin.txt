European Parliament to step up regulation of ratings agencies


The European Parliament on 16 January passed new rules by a large majority, which will regulate and provide a framework for ratings agencies. The agencies will be required to increase transparency and may be held liable for their errors in civil actions. The bill passed with 579 votes in favour, 58 against, and 60 abstentions. This result is unsurprising, as the European Parliament, European Council and European Commission had all already announced in late November that they had reached a compromise on the new rules. The European Commissioner for Financial Services, Michel Barnier, congratulated the European Parliament. “Ratings agencies will be required to be more transparent when they issue ratings of governments, and will be required to follow stricter rules, which will require them to release accounts in the event of errors, whether or not these are intentional,” he said in a statement. Agencies will now no longer be permitted to make more than three unsolicited ratings per year, when they rate governments. The date must be announced in advance, and these ratings are to be published on Friday, after the close of the markets. The law introduces a civil liability regime for ratings agencies, which may be held liable for their errors in cases of severe negligence or intentional violation of legislation. Among several measures which aim to limit conflicts of interest, a ratings agency will not be permitted to issue ratings of entities or products if they control more than 10% of shares in them. Lastly, a rotation rule to open the market to smaller ratings agencies to compete with the large players (Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch, which control 90% of the market) will be instituted, but only for some structured products.
