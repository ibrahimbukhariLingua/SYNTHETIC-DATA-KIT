UBS Asset Management launches new white-label platform


UBS Asset Management has announced the launch of UBS Partner, a white-label technology solution which will enable a step-change in the advisory process and client service offered by banks.UBS Partner, which forms part of the UBS Platform Solutions offering, scans client portfolios on a daily basis, assesses individual portfolios against corresponding risk profiles, key instrument quality criteria and investment goals. Identifying those clients which are not on track to meet their personal financial goal, UBS Partner creates tailored, actionable investment options to best help them get back on course. “We are excited to be able to offer access to UBS Partner globally, an immensely powerful solution which enables banks to change the conversation with their advisory clients centred on their investment goals. We believe this to be the first platform of its kind and we are delighted to already be working with Banca Generali to rollout UBS Partner to their client advisers in the near future.” said William Kennedy, Head of Client Coverage at UBS Asset Management.
