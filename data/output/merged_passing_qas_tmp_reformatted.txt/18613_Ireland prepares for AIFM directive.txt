Ireland prepares for AIFM directive


The Irish central bank on 31 October launched a consultation on the introduction of significant improvements to its non-UCITS regime under the AIFM directive, the Irish fund investment association (IFIA) has announced. The directive will bring in substantial changes for the non-UCITS fund sector, the professional association notes. The current “Qualifying Investor Fund” (QIF) regime will be replaced with a new “Qualifying Investor Alternative Investment Fund” (QIAIF) regime, and a regime dedicated to retail investors will be created at this time. All annexed non-UCITS documents published by the central bank will be replaced with a single booklet covering all aspects of the regulations.
