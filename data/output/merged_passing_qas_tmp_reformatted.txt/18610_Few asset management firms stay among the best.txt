Few asset management firms stay among the best


Investors who select an active fund manager because he has a good track record will be more likely to pick a loser than a winner, a Vanguard study cited by Financial Times Fund Management has found. Vanguard ranked 384 actively-managed British equity funds into five quintiles according to their risk-adjusted returns over five years to the end of 2006, and then monitored their performance over the following five years. Only 15.6% remained in the top quintile over both five-year periods, ending in 2006 and in 2011. But 23.4% fell from the first to the last. And 23.4% were either liquidated or merged due to poor performance.
