BNP Paribas IP to measure carbon footprint of nearly 100 funds


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; }a:link { } BNP Paribas Investment Partners has announced that it has extended measurement of the carbon footprint to nearly 100 equity funds, and is continuing to implement its -2°C climate strategy, which is based on the three pillars of capital allocation, responsible management, involvement and transparency. After announcing the publication of the carbon footprint for 26 of its funds in 2015, ahead of COP 21, the asset management affiliate of the French bank will now calculate the carbon footprint for 70 additional funds. BNPP IP has developed a proprietary calculation methodology to allow its clients access to data which It ensures is “reliable.” It measures and releases only the carbon footprint for funds which meet a double requirement: at least 90% of the shares present in the benchmark index must have carbon data, and this data must be more than 50% tangible and measurable. BNPP IP has also announced that it hopes to “raise awareness” of managers about climate change issues, by making a tool available to them developed by its teams, to allow them to evaluate the impact of their investment choices on the carbon footprint of their portfolios.
