Positive buzz on the first marijuana ETF


Even though it hasn’t had its product on the market for a week, Horizons ETF Management is one of the most successful marijuana dealers in history, writes MarketWatch. The company has seen remarkably strong interest for its Medical Marijuana Life Sciences ETF HMMJ, Wall Street’s first marijuana-themed exchange-traded fund, which launched last week. The fund has traded for four sessions and has risen in each of them, including a surge of 9.9% on Monday, bringing its total rise to 17.8%. It has amassed more than USD28.2 million in assets, according to Horizons, making it the most popular fund launched this month by that metric.
