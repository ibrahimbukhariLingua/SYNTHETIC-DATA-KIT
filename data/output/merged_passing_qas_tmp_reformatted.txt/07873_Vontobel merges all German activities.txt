Vontobel merges all German activities


The Swiss Vontobel group, which has chosen Germany as its “second domestic market,” on Monday announced that it is adopting the single brand name Bank Vontobel Europe AG in the country, as a result of the merger of Vontobel Securities AG in Cologne with Vontobel Europe SA in Frankfurt. The group will now offer private banking, asset management and investment banking services under the single brand name. The managing board at Bank Vontobel Europe AG will be chaired by Frank Wieser, and will also include Alois Ebner, Andreas Heinrichs, Richard Zweng and Matthias Klein. The supervisory board will be chaired by Herbert J. Scheidt, CEO of the Vontobel group.
