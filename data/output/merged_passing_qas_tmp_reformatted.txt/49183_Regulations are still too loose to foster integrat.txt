Regulations are still too loose to foster integration of ESG criteria


Regulations concerning socially responsible investment are very useful in raising awareness of actors in finance to ESG issues, but investors are still sceptical about the real impact of regulations, according to a study published by the association to promote the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). The Global Guide to Responsible Investment Regulation reviewed more than 300 bodies of legislation concerning pension funds, codes of best conduct and information released by businesses. This included interviews with political leaders, investors and market operators in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas.Analysis of the data suggests that regulations have some impact, but regulatory frameworks are not fully aligned with the imperatives of sustainable development. Investors also estimate that governmetns are not clearly indicating the importance of ESG issues.“All too often, ESG regulations treat ESG criteria as an additional option which investors can ignore if they wish,” says Nathan Fabian, director of startegy and research at the PRI. “We also observe that there is little monitoring of clauses related to ESG. Although the leaders we spoke to pointed to the techniques used to track the impact of regulations, this does not go so far as looking at the books of investors, and the results are very rarely made public at any rate,” Fabian adds.Another area of concern which the study raises is that political leaders have not yet drawn a link between their objectives in terms of ESG criteria, such as the COP21 calendar and the United Nations sustainable development objectives, and their financial systems. Chinese, European and French leaders have begun to debate these issues, but no government has very precisely expressed what their expectations are of institutional investors in order to meet these objectives.The association hopes that the study will help goverments to establish a link between sustainable development and the financial industry. With this in mind, governments should collect and publish more information about the way in which investors contribute to or hold back sustainable development objectives.
