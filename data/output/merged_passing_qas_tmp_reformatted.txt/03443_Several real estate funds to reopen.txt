Several real estate funds to reopen


Karl-Heinz Heu√ü, director of Credit Suisse Asset Management Immobilien, has told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that the open-ended real estate fund CS Euroreal will once again begin honouring redemptions, which have been frozen since the end of October, by the end of this month. In July, another similar move is expected from the KanAm grundinvest fund, and specialists are predicting that the Axa Immoselect will soon follow suit.
