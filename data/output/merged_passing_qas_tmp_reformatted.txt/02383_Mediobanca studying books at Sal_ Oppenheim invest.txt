Mediobanca studying books at Sal. Oppenheim investment bank


Mediobanca is carrying out due diligence on Sal. Oppenheimâ€™s German investment banking and equity capital markets business. Deutsche Bank is not interested in these operations, as it focuses on the wealth management and private banking activities of the German-Luxembourg business (EUR130bn in assets), the Financial Times reports. According to sources close to the firm, Mediobanca will probably opt for hiring of teams rather than an acquisition of the entirety of the Sal. Oppenheim investment bank, which has 400 employees. The Italian bank would apparently take on board only a small number of these.
