Credit Suisse preparing third-generation ETFs


Dan Draper, global head of ETFs at Credit Suisse, has announced the forthcoming release in Germany of third-generation ETFs, which combine the advantages of synthetic replication with the transparency of physical replication, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reports. The bank cannot eliminate the counterparty default risks associated with swaps, but will make the assembly more comprehensible to retail investors. The composition of a basket of underlying equities will be published on a weekly basis on the management firmâ€™s website. Risk levels will not be affected, but at least subscribers will know what is in the portfolio.
