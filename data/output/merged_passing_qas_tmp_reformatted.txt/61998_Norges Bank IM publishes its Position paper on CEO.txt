Norges Bank IM publishes its Position paper on CEO remuneration


TheNorges Bank Investment management has published its Position paper on CEO remuneration. The paper is directed at company board and recommends that the board of companies should ensure that remuneration is driven by long-term value creation and aligns CEO and shareholder interests. A substantial proportion of total annual remuneration should be provided as shares that are locked in for at least five and preferably ten years, regardless of resignation or retirement. According to the paper, the board should develop pay practices that are simple and do not put undue strain on corporate governance. Allotted shares should not have performance conditions and the complex criteria that may or may not align with the company’s aims. The board should provide transparency on total remuneration to avoid unacceptable outcomes. CEO remuneration should be determined and settled in cash and locked-in shares each year. The board should also disclose a ceiling for total remuneration for the coming year. The board should ensure that all benefits have a clear business rationale. Pensionable income should constitute a minor part of total remuneration. The board should commit to not offering any end-of-employment arrangements that effectively shorten or dilute the lock-in of shares. The Norges Bank Investment management said that it “will invite peer investors to consider shared principles for effective remuneration, and we look forward to discussing with boards how this general position could be applied, taking into consideration the company’s specific circumstances.”
