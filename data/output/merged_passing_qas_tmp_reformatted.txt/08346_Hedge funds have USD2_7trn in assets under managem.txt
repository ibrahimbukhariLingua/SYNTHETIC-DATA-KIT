Hedge funds have USD2.7trn in assets under management


The global hedge fund industry has more than USD2,700bn of assets under management according to a survey of custodians and administrators calculated for a HFM Week Survey. This figure makes the industry far larger than most market participants have previously estimated, says the Financial Times. The estimate is a more accurate figure than those traditionally reported for the size of the hedge fund industry. It ignores any leverage in funds.
