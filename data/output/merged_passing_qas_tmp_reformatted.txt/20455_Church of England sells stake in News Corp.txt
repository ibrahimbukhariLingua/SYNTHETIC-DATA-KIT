Church of England sells stake in News Corp


After a year of talks with News Corp, the Church of England has decided to sell off all of its shares in the group controlled by Rupert Murdoch, in the wake of the phone hacking scandal. Church authorities have serious doubts about the will of News Corp to reform. The news comes as a hard blow to Murdoch, although the size of the stake sold, at GBP1.9m, represents only a drop in the ocean of a market capitalisation of over USD57bn, or about GBP37bn.
