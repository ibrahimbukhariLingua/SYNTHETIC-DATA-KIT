2010: a comeback year for equities funds


Asset management firms are optimistic that 2010 will be a good year for fund sales, and particularly for equities funds. According to a recent survey by Feri EuroRating Services AG of 56 asset managers in German-speaking countries, 91% estimate that the potential for equity fund sales is “good” or “very good,” while only 44% had this opinion in April. The greatest potential is thought to be for emerging markets equities funds, followed by equities funds investing in European and global equities. Sector equities funds investing in North America have less potential for sales, according to respondents to the survey, the study says. Prospects are also considered good for ETFs by 80% of the firms surveyed. As to planned new product launches, 42% say they are planning to add to their equities fund product offerings, while 41% will offer new alternative products, and 405 bond products.
