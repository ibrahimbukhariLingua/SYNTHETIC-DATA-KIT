Head of Fidelity UK predicts fall in profits


Hugh Mullan, managing director UK at Fidelity Worldwide Inestment, has announced in an interview with Financial Times fund management that he expects profits to fall at his company, as for all players in the sector. This is due to the Retail Distribution Review, the transformation of retirement markets, and the aging of traditional Fidelity clients. Mullan feels that the changes in progress in the United Kingdom are the prelude to what is happening elsewhere. The Netherlands, Denmark, Australia and Switzerland are also on a similar path. Fidelity Worldwide remains a profitable acivity, FTfm notes. Pre-tax profits at FIL Holdings, the British holding company, rose 69%, to GBP30.6m in the year to June 2012, while earnings were down 6.4% to GBP677m.
