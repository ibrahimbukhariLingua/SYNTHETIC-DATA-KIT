Assets at Ashmore down 21% year on year


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } At a publication of its results for the fiscal year ending on 30 June 2015, the British asset management firm Ashmore Group, a specialist in emerging markets, has reported a decline of 21% in its assets year on year. As of 30 June 2015, assets under management totalled USD58.9bn, compared with USD75bn as of 30 June 2014. This is due both to a negative market effect totalling USD6bn, and to a net outflow of USD9.5bn. Despite this negative performance, earnings at the firm rose 8%, to a total of GBP283.3m, compared with GBP262.9m one year earlier. This growth is largely related to the strength of the US dollar against the pound sterling, and to an increase of nearly GBP10m in performance fees (GBP13.3m, compared with GBP3.1m one year earlier), Ashmore says. Pre-tax profits also increase 6%, to a total of GBP181.3m as of 30 June 2015, compared with GBP171.6m as of 30 June 2014. Annual net profits totalled GBP140m as of the end of June 2015, compared with GBP134.7m as of the end of June 2014, an increase of 4%.
