The strategic partnership announced on 5 May by CB Equity Partners (CBE) and Topland Group of Companies (TLG) will aim to invest up to EUR2bn in German real estate. It will aim to take majority stakes in long-term projects, particularly sale & leaseback operations. As the two partners have done in the past, CBE will identify the transactions, and TLG will provide the capital, asset management and real estate expertise.
