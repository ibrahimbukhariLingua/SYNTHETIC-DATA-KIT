Euro zone problems will impact Asia


“We do not believe in the decoupling theory. Problems in the euro zone will have an impact on Asia,” Angus Tulloch, joint managing partner for Asia-Pacific/global emerging markets at First State Investments, tells Newsmanagers in an interview during a visit to Paris.Europeans have invested large amounts in Asia. And if there is a problem, money will be repatriated. In addition. European governments may decide to favour portfolio investments in Europe to the detriment of investments in emerging markets, from pension funds, for example.In Asia, Tulloch says he is currently concerned about China. He estimates that inflation, which is currently 5%, may remain at this level for some time, which would require governments to raise interest rates. Meanwhile, rising income for Chinese employees in recent years will result in decreased competitiveness of the country in some export markets, such as textiles.Overall, Tulloch predicts that the Chinese economy will have a steeper than expected slowdown.In India, the other Asian giant, Tulloch estimates that the market offers great potential for well-managed companies. But the country suffers from the fact that nobody is taking decisions at a government level, in the wake of corruption scandals.Currently, Tulloch is preferring Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore for his funds, although the funds are managed with a bottom-up approach and geographical allocations are merely the result of stock-picking.
