Fatca regulations worry British investors


The British association of investment companies (AIC), an association of closed investment funds, claims that the US administration has not yet answered fundamental questinos about the deployment of Fatca regulations, which are currently under consultation until 30 April. The director of public affairs for the association, Guy Rainbird, speaking at the annual AIC conference, has claimed that compliance with the regulations will be a “nightmare.” According to the head, the architects of the Fatca regulations did not really consider the fundamental issue of how firms will identify their US shareholders, among other issues.
