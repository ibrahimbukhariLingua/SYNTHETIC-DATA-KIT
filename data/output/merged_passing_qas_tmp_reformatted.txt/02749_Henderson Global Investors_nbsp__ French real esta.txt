Henderson Global Investors&nbsp;: French real estate market is becoming attractive again


Henderson Global Investors is currently studying several investment opportunities in the French real estate market. The management firm is prioritizing prime assets in Paris office property and commercial properties throughout France, “two segments in which valuations are now attractive, after 30% to 40% declines from the market peaks in 2007,” HGI says. In the office property market, “after London, Paris is becoming the second most important strategic European market,” says Andy Schofield, head of research at Henderson Global Investors. “If economic conjuncture remains unchanged, we thing that returns will stabilise between 6% and 6.5%. However, only properties in premium locations and those leased for long terms to reliable tenants at current market prices will be able to claim returns on this level. These properties represent only a small part of the market, and, as the number of investors interested in this segment is still small, we think their return rates will fall rapidly. However, most so-called secondary properties, which do not meet the above-mentioned criteria, will follow a completely different trend,” he says.
