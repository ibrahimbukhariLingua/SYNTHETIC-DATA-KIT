Madoff liquidator seeks a further USD555m from USB


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Irving Picard, the legally-appointed trustee for the businesses of Bernard Madoff, on 7 December filed another lawsuit against UBS, seeking USD555m. The Swiss group responded on 8 December in a statement, calling the trustee’s position incomprehensible and baseless. The trustee had already filed a first legal action against UBS and Access International Advisors LLC on 24 November (see Newsmanagers of 25 November 2010), seeking USD2bn for what he claims is their presumed implication in the Ponzi scheme operated by Madoff. UBS is accused of setting up feeder funds through which clients’ money was piped to the investment vehicle operated by the former Nasdaq president. The legally-appointed trustee has also filed suits against JPMorgan Chase & Co and HSBC, seeking USD6.4bn and USD9bn, respectively. The previous day, Picard filed suits against BNP Paribas, Legacy Capital and Khronos Capital Research, among others, according to documents submitted to the US courts.
