Kim Winser to advise 3i


Kim Winser, the British fashion designer who transformed Pringle into a prestigious international brand name, has been recruited as a senior adviser by the private equity firm 3i, to advise it in the areas of retail and consumer goods. 3i also owns the lingerie brand Agent Provocateur and the Hobbs brand of womenâ€™s fashions and shoes, the Sunday Times reports. Winser may join the board of Agent Provocateur, and assist 3i in its future investments, but she will also retain the freedom to work with other private equity investors.
