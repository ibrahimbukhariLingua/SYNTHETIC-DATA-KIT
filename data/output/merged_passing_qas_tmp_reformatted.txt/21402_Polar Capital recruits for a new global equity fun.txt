Polar Capital recruits for a new global equity fund


The asset management firm Polar Capital will be launching its first global equity fund, Citywire reports. To manage the new product, it has recruited two managers, Andy MacKirdy and Christophe Williams. They will be assisted by Andrew Holliman, manager of the Polar Capital North American fund and a former member of the same team as the two recruits from Baillie Gifford. The new fund will be launched in the next few months, but the asset management firm has not yet decided which countries the product will be registered in, a spokesperson for Polar Capital has told Citywire.
