Gartmore to lock in manager shares


According to reports in Citywire, Gartmore, which is preparing for its IPO, will impose a lock-in period on shares held by key managers, including the European star manager Roger Guy. But managers will be allowed to sell one third of their shares each year at the time annual results are announced, beginning in 2011. Citywire, which has obtained a document prepared by one of the banks which is assisting with preparations for the initial public offering, reports that Guy is the largest shareholder among Gartmore employees, who own a combined total of 42% of the firm. The document points out that the manager, along with his co-manager Guillaume Rambourg, represent 44% of revenues for the firm, including performance commissions.
