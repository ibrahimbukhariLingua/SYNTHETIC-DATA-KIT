BlackRock swaps out its equity management teams


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In the past 18 months, BlackRock has replaced the portfolio managers on 80% of its active equity management teams, according to MutualFundWire, citing information in Pensions & Investments. Among the recent replacements are Jean Rosenbaum, managing director and portfolio manager in the global opportunities equity team. The cause of this record turnover is an outflow of USD20.5bn from actively-managed equity portfolios in the twelve months to the end of March. Actively-managed equity funds represent only 7%, or USD291.7bn, of the USD3.9trn in assets under management at BlackRock, but the revenues from these portfolios are responsible for more than 20% of commissions in first quarter, Pensions & Investments points out.
