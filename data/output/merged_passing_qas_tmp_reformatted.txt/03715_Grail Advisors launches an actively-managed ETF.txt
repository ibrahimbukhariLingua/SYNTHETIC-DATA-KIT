Grail Advisors launches an actively-managed ETF


Grail Advisors has released the Grail American Beacon Large Cap Value ETF fund on the NYSE Arca platform. The ETF fund is managed actively, and includes at least 80% US large caps; the objective, according to the website Seeking Alpha, is to outperform the Russell 1000 Value Index by 200-400 basis points, by combining quantitative and subjective analyses. The management commission will be a maximum of 0.79%, 41% less than the average for large cap value funds, Global Pensions states.The promoter for the product will be Grail Advisors, with Fort Worth as sub-advisor. Assets in the fund will be distributed between three management firms, Brandywine Global Investment Management, Hotchkis and Wiley Capital Management, and Metropolitan West Capital Management.Seeking Alpha reports that the new fund differs from the actively-managed ETF fund from Invesco PowerShares in that it allows managers an unlimited number of transactions, instead of only three trades per week. In addition, managers are permitted to make transactions at any time, rather than being required to restrict themselves to the last day of the week. Lastly, the Grail fund will use more traditional active management techniques than PowerShares, which uses largely quantitative techniques. The Grail ETF may cover fewer than 100 equities.
