BlackRock would like to see more transparency for ETFs


The global ETF leader, BlackRock, has called for higher transparency and stronger and more uniform regulation, the Financial Times reports. Joseph Linhares, the head of iShares for Europe, says “ETFs started out as transparent, liquid, simple, vehicles but some have gone to opacity. We need to get back to full transparency across all the range of ETF products.”
