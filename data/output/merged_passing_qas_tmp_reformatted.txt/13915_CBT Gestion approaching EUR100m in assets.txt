CBT Gestion approaching EUR100m in assets


CBT Gestion announces, just when it receives the Actifs d’Or de l’Innovation 2011 prize from Agefi, that it has had net inflows of about EUR100m so far. The FCP CBT Action Eurovol 20 (see Newsmanagers of 9 November 2010) most recently had assets of EUR12.6m. For the firm’s four new products based on the MSCI, with volatility objectives of 5%, 7.5%, 15% and 25% (see Newsmanagers of 5 April), “it is interesting to note,” says Christian Bito, chairman of the firm, “that the largest inflows are going to the CBT vol 15 (EUR22m) and the CBT Action Eurovol 20. That appears to be a sign that the markets are still showing some appetite for risk, and that at any rate, they are not expensive.”
