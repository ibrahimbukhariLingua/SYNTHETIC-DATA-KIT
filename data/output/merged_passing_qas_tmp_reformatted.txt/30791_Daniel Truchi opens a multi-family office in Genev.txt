Truchi explains to the newspaper that he prefers Geneva to Singapore “for the expertise of the people, the unrivalled sophistication of systems in Switzerland, and the culture of private banking, which inspire true confidence in the future of the financial centre.” Truchi, originally from Bordeaux, who will primarily serve Asian and European high net worth clients, admits that he could have gone “back to basis in private management” in Singapore, but “it is more difficult to be an independent manager there than in Switzerland,” he says. In Singapore, “regulations have become rigid, and the creation of an asset management firm is more restrictive in terms of licenses and organisation.”
