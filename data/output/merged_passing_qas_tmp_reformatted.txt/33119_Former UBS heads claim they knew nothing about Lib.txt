Former UBS heads claim they knew nothing about Libor manipulation


On Thursday, 10 January, four former top directors of UBS testified before a British Parliamentary commitee about the Libor scandal. Le Temps reports that they were forced to admit responsibility, but that they have the single line of defence that they didnâ€™t know about it. The four men were in control of the bank from 2005 to 2010, when nearly 50 traders manipulated the Libor inter-bank lending rate to improve their profits: Marcel Rohner, CEO from 2007 to 2009, Huw Jenkins, who was director of the investment bank until 2007, and his two successors, Jerker Johansson and Alex Wilmot-Sitwell.
