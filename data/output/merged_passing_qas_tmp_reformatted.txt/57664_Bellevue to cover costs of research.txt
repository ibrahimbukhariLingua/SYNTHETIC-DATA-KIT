p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } The Swiss asset management group Bellevue on 31 October announced that it has decided to cover costs related to research when the MiFID II directive comes into force at the start of 2018. Bellevue is thus taking the same line as many other Swiss asset management firms, such as Vontobel, GAM and Unigestion, which have announced that they will not pass costs related to research on to the end client.
