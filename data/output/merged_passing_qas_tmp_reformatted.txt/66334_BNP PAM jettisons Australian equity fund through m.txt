BNP PAM jettisons Australian equity fund through merger


BNP Paribas Asset Management is set to drop its Parvest Equity Australia fund by merging it with the Parvest Equity Best Selection World, NewsManagers has found out.Both funds will be gathered on 8 December 2018. BNP PAM Asia had been handed the management of the Australian equity strategy last August following the closure of Sydney-based boutique Arnhem Investment Management, to which BNP PAM had delegated the management of the fund intially. Moreover, BNP PAM held a 40% stake in the Australian manager. In a shareholder notice seen by NewsManagers, BNP PAM argues assets under management of the Parvest Equity Australia fund have plummeted since 2010 to reach AUD46m (€28.2m) in June 2018 from AUD259m (€159m). AUM of the fund have lingered under the AUD50m threshold (€30.7m) since the end of 2017, Additionally, BNP PAM points out investors show less interest for Australia and that distributors seek to focus on more diversified markets. A last reason raised by the manager dwells in the lack of diversity in the Australian equity market whose commodities exposure is too large according to BNP PAM.
