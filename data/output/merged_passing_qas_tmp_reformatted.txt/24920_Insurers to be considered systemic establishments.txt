Insurers to be considered systemic establishments


The financial stability board (FSB) on 10 January announced that it has updated its roadmap for 2012, at a plenary meeting held the same day in Basel. The FSB is planning to extend the concept of a systemic establishment to include a wider circle of banking, and now also insurance, actors. “The FSB has discussed the work to be done to develop the Sifi model further, including an extension to major domestic systemic banks, insurance companies of international systemic important, and to other types of financial institutions,” the board says in a statement. Currently, banks considered systemic are required to maintain an owners’ equity ratio of at least 9%, up from 7% for other banks. The board has already identified 29 such entities worldwide. The FSB will by the end of this year also state the criteria to be included in resolution regimes applicable to systemic establishments. The organisation is also planning to continue its work in shadow banking, OTC and bank pay scales. As to the departure of the vice-chairman of the financial stability board, Philipp Hildebrand, in the wake of his resignation as chairman of the BNS, the chairman of the FSB, Mark Carney, stated that there will be no immediate replacement and that the decision will be taken in consultation with the G20, who appointed Hildebrand in November 2011.
