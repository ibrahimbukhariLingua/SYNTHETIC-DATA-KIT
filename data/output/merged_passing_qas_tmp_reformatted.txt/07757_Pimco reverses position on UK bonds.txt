Pimco reverses position on UK bonds


Although last year it had adopted a negative attitude to the UK due to its rising budget deficit and the deteriorating condition of its public finances, the US management firm Pimco (Allianz Global Investors) has now changed its position: it is now neutral on gilts, rather than underweight, the Financial Times reports. The about-face is all the more significant as Bill Gross, co-head of Pimco, was one of the fiercest critic of the United Kingdom. Since the beginning of the year, returns on 10-year gilts has fallen 16%, while returns on bunds have fallen by 20%.
