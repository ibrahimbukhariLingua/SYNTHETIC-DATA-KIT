Commerzbank reimburses subscribers to a real estate fund


In September 2010, Commerzbank was compelled to freeze redemptions from the Premium Management Immobilien Anlagen fund (PMIA), which invested in open-ended real estate funds whose redemptions had themselves been suspended. Now, Handelsblatt reports, the bank is offering subscribers in the PMIA fund a reimbursement of EUR43.38 for every EUR50 they had invested in the fund, for a four-week period.Commerzbank says this amount corresponds to 92% of the net asset value of the fund, even though shares in the fund are now trading on the stock exchange at 33 euros each.
