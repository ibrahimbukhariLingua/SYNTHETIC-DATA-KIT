Amiral Gestion releases an international bond fund


Amiral Gestion has announced the launch of the Sextand Bond Picking fund, a vehicle of international bonds. The new product, founded on 30 March 2017, intervenes for all categories of rating or sub-segment of the bond markets, the asset management firm indicates on its website. As part of management, the fund tracks no index. It may additionally invest in equities, “particularly as part of arbitrage operations,” Amiral Gestion states. The fund, managed jointly by David Poulet and Jacques Sudre, seeks to generate performance after costs higher than the capitalised Euro Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) cash 3Y index (representing three-year returns on government bonds in euros) plus 100 basis points, via a selection of international bonds, the information document states. However, “as the management style is discretionary, the composition of the portfolio never seeks to reproduce the composition of the benchmark indicator, either geographically or sectorally,” Amiral Gestion warns.
