Growth in asset management will not benefit everybody


«European managers who are well positioned in the cross border space and in global bonds, global equities, specialities or multi-asset are likely to grow more as these areas will attract investor flows,» says Aymeric Poizot, managing director in Fitch’s Fund and Asset Manager Rating Group. Fitch Ratings expects in a new research that the European asset management industry to continue growing in 2014, supported by improving investor confidence and a more solid macro-economic background. However, the agency expects that growth will be unevenly shared, as competition remains intense and market conditions as well as investor demand continue to change. Half of European managers had no fund inflows in the three years to end-July 2013, while the top 10 firms received 50% of inflows in bonds and mixed asset funds, and 75% of inflows into equity funds. With changing market conditions and investor demand, business diversification and a clear marketing strategy capable of anticipating cycles will be increasingly important considerations, according to Fitch Ratings. In addition, innovation and a strong franchise in multi-asset and solutions will be a key performance driver, particularly as this business is less cyclical than traditional equity or bond fund management. The development of defined contribution pension schemes and retail investors’ need for diversified low risk products support growth and innovation in this area.
