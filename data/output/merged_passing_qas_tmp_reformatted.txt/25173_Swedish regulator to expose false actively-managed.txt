Swedish regulator to expose false actively-managed funds


The Swedish market surveillance authority, Finansinspektionen, has begun to take an interest in funds which claim to be actively managed, but which in reality have passive management, the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reports. The regulator has begun to take a closer interest in how Swedish asset management firms inform their clients about actively-managed funds, which develop in a manner similar to that of the benchark index. It is focusing more particularly on the information the asset management firm provides in the prospectus for the fund. “It is important for the information in the prospectus to be correct, and a central piece of information is how the resources of the fund are invested, the risk and the costs of the fund, and whether the description of those corresponds to reality,” says Erik Lindholm at Finansinspektion. The Swedish market autohrity has not yet decided how it would carry out the inspection, but it is planning to do so in the first half of next year, and that will affect several asset management firms which manage funds that are close to the index. “I can’t say what asset management firms we will control, but it isabout having an overall vision,” says Lindholm. Sweden is not the only country to take an interest in actively-managed funds. Denmark has also begun to do so.
