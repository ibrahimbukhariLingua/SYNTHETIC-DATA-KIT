Scandinavian asset management firms bet on institutionals in 2016


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } 66% of asset management firms based in Northern European countries estimate that institutional investors represent a segment of clients which will offer the most opportunities in 2016, a study by Tell Media Group of the Scandinavian fund market (“The Nordic Fund Industry Outlook 2016”) finds. Only 6% cite retail investors. Half of asset management firms surveyed, however, say that they are going to recruit at leat one additional person for their teams covering Northern Europe. Since the circle of experienced professionals is relatively small, a war for talent is to be expected. In the area of human resources, Tell Media Group estimates that asset management firms will need to do more in terms of gender equality. Lastly, the report predicts that the sector will continue to concentrate, while initiatives to reduce costs and introduce a larger services component into product offerings will continue. “In order to navigate this new environment, it will be more important to have good expertise on boards of directors and to have the right directors,” according to the study.
