Resurgence of optimism at asset management firms


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Optimism is rising again in the asset management sector, after the decline seen at the end of 2014, according to the latest CBI/PwC survey of the evolution of the business climate in financial services. Activity volumes were better than expected, and in the next few months, growth is expected to remain vigorous, the survey says. Revenues derived from commissions and fees have risen, but are expected to see only marginal increases over the next three months, as fees remain under high surveillance. Operating costs have fallen steeply and growth in profits has continued, but at a much more moderate pace. Asset management firms remain highly attentive to the trends in the sector, including digitization and distribution of funds, with continuing close attention to transparency and regulation, and to the growth of passively-managed products.
