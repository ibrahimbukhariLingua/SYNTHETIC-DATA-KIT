Former Morgan Stanley manager sues Och-Ziff


A former employee at Och-Ziff in Singapore, Zain Fancy, has filed lawsuits against the New Yokr hedge fund entity Och-Ziff, Bloomberg reports. Fancy claims that Och-Ziff Singapore owes him USD7.9m in salary and equities. Fancy joined Och-Ziff to create an affiliate specialised in real estate, Och-Ziff Real Estate Singapore Pte, but was then fired for failing to declare his involvement in a US Justice department and Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into suspected corruption at Morgan Stanley, where he was head of real estate and banking activities in Asia.
