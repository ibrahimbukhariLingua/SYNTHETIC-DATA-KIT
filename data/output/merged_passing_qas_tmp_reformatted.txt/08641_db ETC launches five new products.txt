db ETC launches five new products


One and a half months after creating its new platform, db ETC Index Plc, and launching the first four products in its range (see Newsmanagers of 9 March 2010), Deutsche Bank has announced that five new ETCs have been admitted to trading on Xetra in Frankfurt, with a product based on the large S&P GSCI index (the db Commodity Booster Euro Hedged ETC) and four ETCs based on sub-indices (db Agriculture Booster Euro Hedged ETC, db Industrial Metals Booster Euro Hedged ETC, db Energy Booster Euro Hedged ETC, and db Natural Gas Booster Euro Hedged ETC). Like the first four products in the series, these ETC funds are hedged for forex risks against the US dollar, and have a Booster optimisation mechanism which limits the risk of losses when positions are rolled to replicate the evolution of commodities futures. All the new ETC products are registered in Germany and carry a management commission of 0.45%.
