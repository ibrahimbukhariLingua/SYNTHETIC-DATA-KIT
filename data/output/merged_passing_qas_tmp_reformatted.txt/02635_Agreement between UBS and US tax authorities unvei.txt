Agreement between UBS and US tax authorities unveiled


An agreement with the US tax authorities has been announced, which will free UBS from having to pay another fine, Le Temps reports. Swiss legal procedure has also been respected, and taxpayers’ right to hearing in a court of law has been maintained. Ultimately, the names of about 4,450 account-holders will be disclosed to the United States, though the IRS, the US tax authority, was seeking 52,000 names. It will certainly get 4,500, and may get as many as 10,000 names, the newspaper reports. According to the IRS, total assets held in Swiss bank accounts by the 4,450 people whose names will be handed over to the tax authorities may at some times have totalled “over USD18bn.” The IRS says it is pleased that “the Swiss government has undertaken to examine and handle other demands for information about account-holders at other banks,” in cases “equivalent” to those at UBS. The Swiss confederation, for its part, has decided to sell its CHF6bn stake in UBS. The convertible bonds held by the Swiss federal government will be converted into equities, probably on 25 August, and then sold to institutional investors, UBS says. A further issue of 332 million new shares (for a total value of CHF5.56bn currently) will also be held.
