ACG Management develops a new FIP range


ACG Management has launched new funds dedicated to assisting Corsican and French overseas companies, entitled FIP Néoveris Corse 2017 and FIP Océanis 2017. Both funds are managed by local teams, a statement explains, and offer reductions in income tax (IR) of 38% off the total subscribed, in exchange for a risk of capital loss and asset being locked in until 31/12/2017 at the latest. For the FIP Océanis fund, ACG notes that it has four investment professionals based in Réunion. The firm has raised about EUR88m in the past 15 years for 89 overseas SMEs. The fund will invest primarily in Réunion, as well as in New Caledonia, Guyana, French Polynesia and the French Carribean, with at least 70% invested directly in the capital of SMEs which offer real diversification, with privileged access to the market of private businesses. In Corsica, ACG Management has already invested EUR172m in 56 SMEs. The management team includes six people. The new Corsican FIP is multi-sectoral, and will invest a minimum of 70% directly in the capital of SMEs. The firm points out that the first two Corsica FIP funds from ACG Management, Néoveris Corse 2007 and 2008, have already been closed, with 97% and 104% of nominal investment (excluding tax breaks), and without deferment. The same is true for the next round, Néoveris Corse 2009, which will be closed by 31/10/2017 at the latest, at a minimum of 106% of nominal investment (excluding tax breaks). Past performance does not predict future performance.
