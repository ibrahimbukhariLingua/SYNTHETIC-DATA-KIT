Barings awarded renminbi QFII status in China


Baring Asset Management has been awarded a Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) licence by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. «RQFII status means Barings has another direct access channel to Renminbi-denominated securities, in addition to the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) license and provides much greater flexibility in terms of asset allocation compared to the QFII programme,» says a press statement. The RQFII licence will support Barings’ existing offshore product set. Advantages of the RQFII programme include fully flexible allocations to both equities and bonds, and daily liquidity for open-ended funds. In particular, the greater access to fixed income investments – the licence allows for the full RQFII quota to be allocated to just bonds for example – will be very positive for foreign institutional and retail investors attracted to China’s USD5 trillion (RMB30 trillion) onshore bond market, believes Barings. “Barings has been a major player in Hong Kong and mainland China for many years and has extensive experience of the market. The RQFII programme is further evidence of China’s integration into mainstream global financial markets, and there are clear benefits for investors looking for onshore opportunities in the world’s second-largest economy. This is a natural evolution for Barings’ business in China and will support the significant on-going developments we have in the region,” David Stevenson, head of business development at Baring Asset Management, said.
