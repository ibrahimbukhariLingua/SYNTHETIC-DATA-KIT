US investors in distressed debt take aim for Europe


Europe may be facing strong growth in restructuring operations in the form of LBOs, at a time when banks are tending to unload their riskier loans to investors specialised in distressed debt, the Financial Times reports. Several US firms, such as Apollo Management and Oaktree, have raised funds and added to their European teams in the wake of the financial crisis. However, hitherto banks have not allowed themselves to suffer losses on depreciated loans. Many of them have now added to their ownersâ€™ equity and may accelerate the sales of their dubious loans, according to private equity experts.
