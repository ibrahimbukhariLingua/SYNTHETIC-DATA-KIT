MiFID expected to have mildly negative impact on third-party fund sales


The cross-border asset managers surveyed for Cerulli Associates’ latest report, European Distribution Dynamics 2017: Managing Complexity as Opportunities Evolve expect the introduction of MiFID II to have a mildly negative effect on the sale of third-party funds in Europe. A clear majority, 54%, believe that such sales will be unaffected; 27% believe that sales will fall slightly, and 4% that sales will fall significantly. So almost one in three anticipate a drop, and even the minority that expect sales to increase (another 4%) think they will do so only slightly."It is remarkable that, although MiFID II promises to promote transparency, accountability, and co-operation across the distribution chain and empower end investors, practically no one in the industry expects it to achieve these aims,» says Angelos Gousios, director of European retail research at Cerulli and lead author of the report."The local interpretations of the regulation will be key, and we may see some backward movement in terms of unifying the European market and allowing managers to form a homogeneous distribution strategy,» says Barbara Wall, Cerulli’s Europe managing director.
