BEX Capital, an investment firm that focuses exclusively on fund-of-funds (FoF) secondaries, today announcedthe close of BEX Fund III, with total commitments of $365m.This was the first and final close of BEX Fund III, with fundraising completed in the space of four months. BEX Capital received strong support from existing investors with over 90% returning to commit to BEX Fund III. The fund was substantially oversubscribed and closed in excess of its original target of $280m. As per its predecessors, BEX Capital’s third fund will acquire positions in private equity FoFs, secondary funds and co-investment funds, with a strong bias towards mature markets and assets. At $365m, it is the largest pool of capital solely dedicated to FoF secondaries. The fund will make individual investments ranging from $1m to $500m. At the larger end of this scale, BEX Capital will draw support from its core group of investors. BEX Capital has also introduced the concept of ‘X shares’, a class of shares solely open to NGOs and major non-profit foundations. These investors do not pay any fees nor are they charged carried interest, so they can fully benefit from the fund’s performance and reinvest the gross return into the support of their mission.
