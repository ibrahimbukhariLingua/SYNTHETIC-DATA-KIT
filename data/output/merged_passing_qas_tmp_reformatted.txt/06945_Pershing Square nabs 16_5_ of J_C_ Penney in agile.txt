p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Pershing Square Capital Management has pulled off an exemplary raid on J.C. Penney, the Wall Street Journal reports. The hedge fund management firm led by William Ackman first bought slightly under 5% of the retailer in August, and then waited for the right moment to discretely pick up an option on 4 million more shares. In total, the hedge fund manager paid UDS903m for its stake in J.C. Penney, while the ordinary shares alone are already worth USD1.14bn, following the announcement of the deal. In addition, Pershing Square has teamed up with Vornado Realty Trust, which itself on Friday announced that it controls 9.9% of J.C. Penney.
