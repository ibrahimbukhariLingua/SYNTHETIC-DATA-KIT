Stoxx releases a range of low-risk indices


The Swiss firm Stoxx Ltd on 9 October announced the launch of the Stoxx Europe Low Risk Weighted 100 range of indices, which aim to replicate a hypothetical portfolio which would focus on 100 shares of the Stoxx Europe 600 which have the lowest volatility over 12 months. The components are weighted depending on the inverse of their volatility, in order to minimise the risk for the new product: backtesting the Stoxx Europe Low Risk 100 to 16 March 2001, annual volatility would have been 13.28%, while the volatility of the Stoxx Europe 600 over that period was 21.16%.The new index is designed to serve as underlying both for actively-managed funds and for ETFs and other investable products. Weighting will be adjusted in February, May, August, and November, and no share will be allowed to represent more than 10% of the index.The range includes the indices listed in the attachment.
