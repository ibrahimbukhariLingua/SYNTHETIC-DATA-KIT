Lloyds fined for delay in reimbursing clients


The British Financial Services Authority (FSA) on 19 February announced that it has sentenced Lloyds bank to pay GBP4.3m, or nearly EUR5m, in fines, for delays in reimbursing clients who lost money due to forced sales of credit insurance. Three affiliates of Lloyds Banking Group (LBG) were sanctioned for paying reparations too late to 140,000 people, nearly one quarter of those who were entitled to reimbursements. Banks long sold credit insurance, known as PPI, improperly. The insurance would have allowed the insurer to arrange loan repayments despite a loss of income due to illness, death, or job loss. But the practice was condemned by the courts, and Bitish firms have had to pay billions of pounds in provisions to cover the costs of reimbursing clients over the case. The FSA finds that payments should normally have been made quickly, within 28 days following a letter being sent to clients. The significant number of complaints is the result of an error on the part of LBG, and means clients cannot hope that their reimbursements will be paid promptly when due, says Tracey McDermott, one of the directors of the FSA, in a statement. “The PPI issue remains a priority for the FSA, and we will continue to monitor the way that companies concerned treat claims and pay reimbursements,” he added.
