Vietnam clamps down on gold speculation


L’Echo reports that the Vietnamese government on 1 January decided that all gold trading platforms will be shut down by the end of March. The reason is said to be “excessive speculation and use of abnormal levels of leverage,” according to Vietnamese officials. The measure also applies to foreign accounts on the same platforms, but will not affect jewelry. The industry generates more than USD1bn in revenues per day for Vietnam, through the activities of 20 key market players.
