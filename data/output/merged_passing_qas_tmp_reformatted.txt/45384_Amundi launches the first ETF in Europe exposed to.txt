p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Amundi is continuing to innovate on the European ETF market, with the launch of the Amundi ETF Floating Rate USD Corporate Ucits ETF. The single ETF has been listed on Euronext Paris and will soon be available on the major European stock exchanges. Amundi ETF Floating Rate USD Corporate Ucits ETF (ISIN code: FR0012647451) is based on the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid FRN Investment Grade Corporates 100 (Total Return, i.e., coupons reinvested) as its index. This offers access to the market in Floating Rate Notes denominated in USD, for exposure to a selection of 40 to 100 of the most liquid shares, issued by private companies in developed countries. Its methodology includes a liquidity filter, which takes into account the volumes traded and the number of trades, to select the most liquid bonds. The index is revised every month, with the total weight of each issuer limited to 5%. The first European ETF to offer exposure to variable rate bonds denominated in EUR whose total remaining time to maturity is between 1 and 3 years was listed by Amundi ETF in September 2014 on Euronext Paris. The new exposure to US bonds, offered at a TER of 0.18%, is a sign of the strong engagement of Amundi to provide investors with a complete toolbox of investment solutions, a statement says.
