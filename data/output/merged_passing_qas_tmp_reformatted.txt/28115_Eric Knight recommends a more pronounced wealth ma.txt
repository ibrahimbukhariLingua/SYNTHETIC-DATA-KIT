Eric Knight recommends a more pronounced wealth management positioning for UBS


The US investors Eric Knight, founder of the activist asset management firm Knight Vinke Asset management, and now a shareholder in UBS, with a stake of slightly under 3%, claims that the group should sell off its investment banking division, or failing that, reduce it to a minimum. “UBS should clearly position itself as a wealth manager, and further reduce its investment banking activities,” he has told Tages-Anzeiger. Knight claims that the non-essential areas of the investment bank should be eliminated. “We have held meetings with shareholders and we know that there is a large consensus in favour of such measures,” Knight claims. Everyone has enormous respect for Axel Weber, the chairman of the board of directors. But many feel that the board is too weak compared with CEO Sergio Ermotti. “We have the impression that it is the board which wears the trousers at UBS, and the CEO who makes decisions on questions of structure and strategy.” A majority of shareholders feel that the changes that have been made so far are merely cosmetic, he says. “Some assets hae been transferred from one sector to another, but the risk remains.” UBS is now composed of a “good” bank and a “bad” bank, and the latter makes three times as much as the former. “Nobody is interested in the new face of the good bank. What counts is results, and on the whole, those are hardly attractive.”
