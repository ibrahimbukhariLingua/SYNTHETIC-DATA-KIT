Deutsche AM and Franklin Templeton to absorb costs of external research


Deutsche Asset Management on 13 September announced that it had decided to absorb the costs of external research distributed to its clients. In an email sent to all personnel, Nicolas Moreau, head of Deutsche AM and a member of the board of directors at Deutsche Bank, says that “our approach is the best possible solution to meet the requirements of the new directive, and that will allow us to remain fully engaged in providing top quality solutions for our clients,” a statement says. The statement says that Deutsche AM will continue to buy in external research, so that managers have all the means needed to implement their investment processes. With this in mind, the statement adds, Deutsche AM will be negotiating with its external research providers to optimize costs.Franklin Templeton, for its part, has confirmed that it also plans to bear the cost of external research, so that clients will be able to continue to benefit from both in-house and external research. While emphasizing the quality of its proprietary research, related to the international presence of the group, Franklin Templeton claims in a statement that “external research represents a significant contribution to our internal research process, and brings an independent perspective to define and improve our own research.” Deutsche Asset Management and Franklin Templeton come as additions to the list of asset management firms who are planning to take on the cost of external research, rather than passing these on to the end client. In the past few days, Newton IM, Insight Investment, Aviva Investors and Aberdeen Standard Investments have also opted for this solution.
