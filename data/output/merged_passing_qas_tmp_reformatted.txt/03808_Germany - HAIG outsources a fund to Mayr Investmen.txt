Germany - HAIG outsources a fund to Mayr Investment Managers


The Munich-based wealth management firm Mayr Investment Managers has been granted a mandate to consult to the WM Fund Sachwertportfolio fund, which was launched in April by Hauck & Aufh√§user Investment Gesellschaft (HAIG), Das Investment reports. The fund invests in businesses in sectors which are relatively resistant to the crisis, and which have the least possible connection to the financial sector. Target businesses also must have low levels of debt, the value of the business must include physical assets, and their cash reserves must be minimal. The objective of the fund is not performance, but rather to construct a portfolio which would be likely to survive an economic and financial crisis.
