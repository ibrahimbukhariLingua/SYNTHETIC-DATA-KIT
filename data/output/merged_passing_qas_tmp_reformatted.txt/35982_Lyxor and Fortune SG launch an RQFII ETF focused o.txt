Lyxor and Fortune SG launch an RQFII ETF focused on Chinese equities


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Lyxor is extending its emerging markets product range with a physical replication ETF which offers exposure to domestic Chinese equities, or “A-shares.” The LYXOR ETF MSCI China A is the first physical ETF of A-Shares to be listed on Euronext Paris. It will also be listed on the London Stock Exchange from 9 September 2014. The ETF replicates the evolution fo the MSCI China A index, whose equities are listed in renminbi on domestic markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen. The index is composed of about 460 companies and offers better coverage and greater sectoral diversification than similar existing indices, according to Lyxor. The fund is managed by the Kong Kong subsidiary of Fortune SG, a Chinese joint venture from Lyxor, which has obtained a renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor (RQFII) quota from the Chinese authorities to launch an ETF in Europe. Lyxor manages the largest European ETF exposed to Chinese companies (via issuers listed in Hong Kong), with more than USD1bn in assets under management. “A-Shares represent about 75% of the total market capitalisation of Chinese equities. Previously, these equities have all been under-represented in portfolios. Although investment constraints related to the quota system persist, the pace of regulatory reforms and other initiatives, such as the Shanghai / Hong Kong Stock Connect programme, increase the prospects for integrating these equities. Many international investors are already seeking investment opportunities in A-Shares. Our new ETF, a flexible and diversified vehicle, meets these needs,” says Arnaud Llinas, global head of ETFs and index-based management at Lyxor.
