“Careful in mov ing towards ‘fair price’, especially in Paris”


Caroline Le Meaux, head of delegated fund management in the department of pensions and solidarity of the Caisse des dépôts How have fees changed in asset management? We outsource more than 80% of our investment management (out of 15 billion euros) and we have seen the decline in fees accelerate in recent years, with marketing pressure rather specific to Paris, due both to competition between asset management companies and to their priced-driven marketing strategies. This is the case for non-money market bonds, which makes sense given the decline in interest rates and yields. But it’s also true for equities, for which the relative decline has been even greater, something that is counterintuitive, given the impact of index management and ETFs. Asset management is still a fixed-cost business and in private equity fees are not digressive enough in proportion to AuM. Have we hit bottom? We may have even gone past bottom in listed assets. It is important not to overdo things in the other direction and to trend towards fair price. If fees are too low, they aren’t sustainable, particularly for French strategies, which must continue to invest to maintain their competitive edges and ensure their quality of service. We have to reason on the basis of costs: management fees, of course, but also points of annual underperformance… The best offer is not always the least expensive one. There is an efficiency frontier. For a fund manager it’s very easy to boost results by cutting costs (management and research costs) and this does not show up much when the markets are rising, but what about when they stop rising? Moreover, with fees down sharply, questions may arise of transparency in ancillary or hidden fees.
