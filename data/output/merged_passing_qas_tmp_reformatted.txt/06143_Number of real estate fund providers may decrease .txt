Number of real estate fund providers may decrease by 50% in five years


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Hans Joachim Reinke, chairman of the board at Union Investment, estimates that the problems encountered by open-ended real estate funds (EUR22bn are in funds which are closed to recemptions, out of a total of EUR87bn) can be chalked up to failings of management, as the fund managers concerned did not distinguish between retail and institutional investor clients, which Deka (EUR20bn) and Union (EUR18bn) did do.Reinke estimates that in five yearsâ€™ time, only 7 to 8 providers will still be offering open-ended real estate funds to retail clients in Germany, compared with 14 presently.He also estimates that draft legislation of real estate funds is generally headed in the right direction, but would like to see some refinements. He would like to see the minimal retention time be 12 months and not 24 months; he also warns that redemptions by retail investors should be limited to EUR20,000 rather than EUR5,000 per month.
