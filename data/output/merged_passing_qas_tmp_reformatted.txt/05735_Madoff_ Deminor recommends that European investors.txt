Madoff: Deminor recommends that European investors organise


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The French shareholder advising firm Deminor on 9 December called on European investors who were victims of the Madoff fraud not to rely exclusively on the action of the court-appointed trustee for the business in the United States, who it claims is not covering indirect clients. “Deminor has noted multiple legal actions recently filed by the administrator in the Madoff case,” the agency says. According to Deminor, these actions “have the objective of regaining as much money as possible for the ‘Madoff liquidation,’ to be redistributed to Madoff ‘clients.'” However, “the vast majority of European investors defended by Deminor had an indirect exposure to Madoff” via funds or banks, the agency points out. It says that “in order to avoid a potential dilution of their reimbursement, it is of the highest importance for investors not to rely on the actions of the US Trustee, and to undertake European initiatives .. in order to obtain complete indemnisation.”
