Margins in Swiss private banking under pressure


Private Banking activities in Switzerland have been put to the test in the past few years due to stricter regulations and more demanding clients. In this much more competitive environment, margins have been eroded, according to a study entitled “International Banking Study 2011,” which has recently been published by the banking and finance institute at the University of Zurich. According to the study, which is based on data from 209 firms in nine countries, including Switzerland, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, average gross margins have fallen from 75 basis points (bp) in 2007 to 61 bp in 2010. A decline in the number of offshore clients who are less sensitive to the price factor has also contributed. The average cost/income ratio for Swiss banks has deteriorated by 17 percentage points between 2007 and 2010, to 77%, the lowest level of the nine countries included in the study. Pressure on banking confidentiality led to large amounts of capital being withdrawn in 2009, possibly as much as 5% to 10% of assets under management. But the trend turned around in 2010, due to the falling euro and the European debt crisis. Due to pressure from international tax authorities, the proportion of assets managed in a discretionary manner has fallen from 27% in 2005 to 23% in 2005, with a much stronger impact on smaller establishments, where discretionary assets have fallen to 25% last year, from 31% in 2005. The study also finds that small is not necessarily beautiful. On average, the productivity of banks which manage less than CHF10bn is lower than that of larger establishments. Earnings are much lower per employee, while costs are only slightly lower. But size is not the only criterion, as some of the smallest banks studied were highly competitive despite that, the study finds. They can be even more competitive, due to their strong potential for outsourcing. 56% of small banks operate their own IT platform, without relying on third-party services, the authors find. The 40 largest Swiss banks in terms of asset had CHF3.9trn in assets as of the end of 2010, while total assets under management by the 43 smaller establishments came to CHF130bn, slightly over 3% of the total. These figures highlight the fragmentation of the Swiss private banking sector, where the cumulative market share of UBS and Credit Suisse adds up to 56%.
