United States - Hedge funds will profit from government aid to AIG


Some of the billions of dollars in aid provided by the US government to inject liquidity into American International Group (AIG) will profit hedge funds who bet that the residential real estate market would go down, say sources close to the investors. These are perfectly legal transactions, the Wall Street Journal reports: investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank sold CDS to hedge funds, which allowed the funds to bet that default rates on mortgages would rise, which ultimately forced AIG to provide billions of dollars in collateral, largely to the banks which were lending it the money. The newspaper reports that of USD173.3bn in government assistance received by AIG, these bets on residential real estate will cost taxpayers about USD52bn.
