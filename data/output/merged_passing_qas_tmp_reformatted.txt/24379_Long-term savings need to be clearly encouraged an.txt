Long-term savings need to be clearly encouraged and not penalised


A few days after the announcement of a new increase in savings taxation, the French financial management association (AFG) on 1 February, at a press conference, expressed its opposition to this approach, which contradicts what would be the optimal course of action. “Ongoing increases in taxes on savings and its volatility, which have been increased further in the past few weeks, completely discourage retail investors from returning to long-term investments, particularly in equities, while regulation of institutional investors is increasingly driving them to short-term investments,” the president of the AFG, Paul-Henri de la Porte du Theil, says. The tax on financial transactions, which is emblematic of these current changes, will be applied in only one country and will inevitably have negative consequences for French asset management and the financing of the French economy. The AFG president has also denounced the weakness of Europe compared with US regulations, such as the FATCA law; these US laws are in practice international weapons to defend US competitiveness. In the chapter on European regulations, the AFG says that at the necessary level of balanced regulations, all market actors would be required to submit to consistent frameworks and controls. This is the reason that the emblematic PRIPS legislation is necessary, as it provides a “deferred, consistent vector of harmonisation between the various products and policies available to retail clients.”
