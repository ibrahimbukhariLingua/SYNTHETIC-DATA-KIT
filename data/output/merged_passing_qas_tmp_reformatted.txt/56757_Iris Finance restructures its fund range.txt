Iris Finance restructures its fund range


The asset management firm Iris Finance has announced on its website that it has decided to restructure its range of funds “to better rationalize its management service.” As a part of this move, the Iris Evolution fund will be absorbed into the fund Iris Santé from 31 December 2017. The objective is to “allow the asset management team to have larger assets, and to orient its intervention decisions on the markets in more favourable conditions for shareholders,” the asset management firm states. The absorbing fund, Iris Santé, will also undergo changes as of 31 December 2017 “to adopt new management guidelines and redefine its investment policy, to abandon the theme of the health care sector, which is considered too restrictive in the current international context,” Iris Finance adds. From 2 January 2018, the fund will thus become known as Iris Avenir, and will implement “dynamic management oriented to international equities, all sectors of activity, all geographical regions and all cap sizes combined,” the asset management firm says. As of the end of October 2017, the Iris Evolution fund had EUR27.65m in assets under management. For its part, the Iris Santé fund had EUR6.6m in assets as of 31 October 2017.
