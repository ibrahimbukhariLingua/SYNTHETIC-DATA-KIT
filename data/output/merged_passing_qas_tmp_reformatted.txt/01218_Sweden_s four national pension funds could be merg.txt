Sweden’s four national pension funds could be merged


A report has been published by an independent think-tank from within the Swedish Ministry of Finance suggesting the country’s four pension buffer funds should be merged into one, to achieve scale advantages and potentially boost assets by SEK1bn (EUR958m) annually, says IPE.com. The Swedish state pensions system could save some SEK300m in reduced costs as well as increase returns by SEK700m annually if it were to merge AP-Fonden 1-4.
