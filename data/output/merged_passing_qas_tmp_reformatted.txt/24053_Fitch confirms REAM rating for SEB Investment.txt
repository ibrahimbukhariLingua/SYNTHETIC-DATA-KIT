Fitch confirms REAM rating for SEB Investment


Fitch Ratings has affirmed SEB Investment GmbH’s (SEB) ‘M2' Real Estate Asset Manager rating. The rating covers the company’s real estate investment operations.The affirmation «reflects SEB’s strong investment management capabilities and its effective asset management», explains the rating agency. «Nonetheless, SEB faces uncertainty regarding its ability to successfully re-open and avoid liquidating its flagship fund, SEB ImmoInvest, no later than May 2012". With EUR6.3bn in (net) assets under management (AUM), this fund represents 53% of the firm’s real estate AUM.In Fitch’s opinion «SEB’s sustainability is not contingent on the re-opening of ImmoInvest. SEB has made progress in diversifying its investor base away from retail investors to institutional and international investors with institutional investors now representing around 48% of gross AUM as of December 2011. Fitch expects these areas of the business to continue growing as SEB places a greater emphasis on this segment, independent of the status of ImmoInvest».Fitch will review SEB’s rating in mid-2012 following the regulatory deadline for the reopening of ImmoInvest.
