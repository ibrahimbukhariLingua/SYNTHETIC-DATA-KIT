Negative ratings outlook in 2012 for EMEA region businesses


The year 2012 will be a hard one for non-financial sector businesses of the EMEA region (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa), according to a study published on 12 January by Moody’s Investors Service. The agency explains that its predictions are largely due to the European debt crisis, the weakness of the macroeconomic context, a downturn in consumer confidence and a degration of financing conditions.“This year, we are expecting far more ratings downgrades than upgrades, both for investment grade category and speculative grade category businesses,” says Jean-Michel Carayon, senior vice president in the Credit Policy group, and co-author of the study. “This trend is part of an ongoing degradation observed in late 2011: in the first three quarters, ratings upgrades outnumbered downgrades by 2:1, but in fourth quarter, there were nine times more downgrades than upgrades.”The turbulence on financial markets, efforts to clean up public finances and reduction in debt in the banking sector would continue to slow growth in 2012, Moody’s predicts. The ratings agency predictions include a high level of uncertainty, particularly for the euro zone, about the risk of significant downgrades which might affect the credit quality of businesses.Moody’s points out that issuers in the speculative category have significant financing needs, and their liquidity profile, currently solid, will give them only short-term flexibility. Restricted access to credit markets over a longer term may put the ability of many busineses in the speculative category to retain their liquidity profile to the test, which would be enough to call their rating into question. In regard to the current macroeconomic scenarios, Moody’s predicts a slight increase in default rates in 2012 in the speculative category from its low level of under 3% in 2011. In the case of a more pessimistic macroeconomic scenario and recession in the euro zone, the default rate might rise to the high end of the single-digit range.Public issuers and businesses whose activities are geographically concentrated in economically poorly-performing countries are more exposed to negative sources of tension in difficult economic conjuncture. According to Moody’s austerity measures are more directly damaging to companies whose earnings depend strongly on public spending.
