Gordon Brown wants to rein in banking sector bonuses


The UK prime minister Gordon Brown said in an interview with the Financial Times that «pay and bonuses should be based on long-term success not short-term speculative gains; banks should “claw back” bankers’ rewards if their performance suffered in subsequent years; and regulators should be able to impose higher capital requirements on financial institutions». But «he was unenthusiastic about French-led pressure for a mandatory cap on bankers’ bonuses, warning it would be difficult to enforce».
