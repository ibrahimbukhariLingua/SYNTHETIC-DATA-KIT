The deal allows the firm to double its size in Brazil, to EUR1.11bn, and to take a further step toward its long-term goal of becoming an independent asset management firm which counts in Brazil. The Italian company is already present in the Latin American country, whose asset management sector weighs in at a total of EUR750m as of the end of December 2014, with Azimut Brasile. Quest, founded in 2001 by the Brazilian former minister of telecommunications and chairman of the national development bank BNDES, Luiz Carlos Mendonça de Barros, mainly manages equity products, and is known as one of the best-performing asset management firms in Brazil, according to a statement. It is known largely for its high yield funds, such as Quest Ações, Quest Small Caps and Quest Equity Hedge. The firm has 30 personnel, and is aimed at institutional investors (who represent 55% of its client base), high net worth individuals and private investors (34%), and financial institutions (10%). With Azimut Brasile, the two companies will form a joint venture with AZ Quest. For the operation, the founder, De Barros, the investment bank BTG Pactual, and the asset management team will sell 35%, 15% and 10% of the capital in Quest to Azimut, respectively. De Barros will remain chairman of the board of directors at AZ Quest. The management of Quest, which will retain its independence, will be tied to the company for at least eight years. Lastly, a part of the earnings from the sale will be reinvested into the company, and into the recruitment of new professionals, which will make it possible to diversify the product range.
