Fees for institutional funds may be slashed


According to a survey carried out by Cerulli Associates, 34.8% of asset managers in Europe expect the commissions they can charge institutionals to be reduced, though only 4% said so in 2012, while 60.9% predict that they will not change, and 4.3% expect an increase. However, the future seems less dark for managers of segregated accounts, only 17.4% of whom predict a decline in commissions, while 78.3% predict that they will not change, and 4.3% expect them to increase.
