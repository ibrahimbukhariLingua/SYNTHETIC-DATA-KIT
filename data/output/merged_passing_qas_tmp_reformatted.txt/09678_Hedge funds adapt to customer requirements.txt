Hedge funds adapt to customer requirements


Hedge funds are modifying their behaviour to meet the increased requirements of institutional investors in the areas of transparency and costs. According to an international study undertaken by SEI in partnership with Greenwich Associates, a large majority of institutionals (80%) are not planning to alter their hedge fund allocations in the next twelve months, while 15% are planning to increase their allocations to these funds. However, over 70% of institutionals have added new requirements for transparency, with very strong demand for fund valuation methdologies. Managers will now need to explain their sources of alpha. Investors have also continued their efforts to influence fee structures. Nearly one respondent in five said they had negotiated terms which differ from the traditional “2/20,” i.e., 2% annual management fees and 20% performance commission for single funds, or “1/10” for funds of hedge funds.
