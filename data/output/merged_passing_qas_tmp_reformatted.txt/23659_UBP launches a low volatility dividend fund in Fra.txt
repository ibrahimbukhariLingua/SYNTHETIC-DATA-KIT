UBP launches a low volatility dividend fund in France


The Swiss bank UBP has launched in France the UBAM – Europe Equity Dividend+ fund, a fund which invests in shares in European businesses which pay stable dividends, and which includes a put strategy to profit from volatility. The product, launched on 15 December 2011, is designed to benefit of an equities market “that is expected to oscillate between -15% and +15% per year over the next three years,” says Dominique Leprévots, chairman of the board at UBI, the French arm of UBP, which unveiled the product on Tuesday. “To this end, it is essential to focus on the quality of businesses and also to use equities more for the revenues that they can generate, than for the gains. The portfolio will thus invest in equities from large European companies with a defensive profile which pay consistent dividends and generate stable returns of 5% per year,” explains the director. “In addition, we want to profit from volatility. To do that, we sell calls on equities that we have in the portfolio, which can also earn 5%. This systematic call sale strategy aims to limit losses in phases of falling markets, but on the other hand partly limits thee gains when the shares rise. The portfolio thus aims for gross returns of 10% per year. The fund is managed by a team in London led by Rob Jones and Scott Meech, co-heads of European equities, who have both been fund managers at Threadneedle. It also includes two option hedging experts. The fund, which was originally created for institutional investors, to whom, of course, the fund is aimed, will also be made available to individuals, largely via platforms. Assets total about EUR50m, though it has the capacity for up to EUR500m.
