East Capital Explorer liquidates its Russian utilities fund


The investment firm East Capital Explorer, listed in Stockholm, will be liquidating the East Capital Power Utilities Fund, in which it had been invested, and from which it expects to recuperate EUR14.2m, as announced. The remaining assets will be distributed in early 2013. The participation of East Capital Explorer in the fund represented EUR25.4m, which corresponds to 9% of the firmâ€™s net asset value. East Capital Power Utilities Fund aimed to benefit from concentration and liberalisation in the Russian utility sector. But the sector has not developed as expected, East Capital Explorer explains. Investment in the fund also resulted in annual pre-tax losses of 2.6% between December 2007 and 30 November 2012.
