Pictet launches a fundamental government bond product


The Luxembourg-registered, UCITS-compliant Pictet-Global Bonds Fundamental fund, managed by Mickael Benhaim, co-head of global & regional bonds, was launched on 31 January by Pictet Asset Management. The product invests in government bonds worldwide, based on a fundamental analysis to determine if the issuer has the ability and the desire to honour its commitments. This provides a way to diversify currencies and to bet on more rapid economic growth in emerging countries.No distinction will be drawn between sovereign borrowers in developed and emerging markets, which will allow subscribers to reduce their risks and increase their returns. This arrangement has the advantage of presenting none of the classic structural flaws of bond indices, which weight issuers depending on their capitalisation, which thus assigns more weight to governments which issue the most debt, whether or not these debt levels are sustainable.In other words, Pictet is adopting a strategy similar to the one applied by the team led by St√©phane Monier (Lombard Odier Investment Managers) for the LO-Funds-Global Government Bond fund.The Pictet fund is now registered for sale in Germany, Austria, Finland, France (as of 17 February), Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Sweden. It is available in eight share classes, one of which is a retail share class in euros.CharacteristicsName: Pictet Global Bonds fundamental R EURISIN code: LU0725946494Front-end fee: 5%Management commission: 1%
