Hermes speaks out against German brain drain danger


The British management firm Hermes on Wednesday sent a letter to the presidents of the 80 largest German companies (the businesses included in the Dax and MDax indexes) to tell them that in their opinion, a rule that forbids board members from becoming members of the supervisory board for two years after they leave their jobs runs the risk of costing the companies precious experience and expertise, the Financial Times reports. The rule is included in a new law on remuneration which came into force this month, and has also come in for criticism from the largest asset management firm in the country, DWS (Deutsche Bank group).
