Profits at Swiss Life Asset Managers up 16% in first half


The Swiss Life group on 14 August announced that sectoral profits for Swiss Life Asset Managers ncreased by 16% in first half to a total of CHF71m, boosted by rising commission revenues. In the first six months of 2013, the Swiss Life group earned CHF551m in revenues from fees and commissions (compared with CHF524m the previous year). This increase is due partly to an increase in earnings from Swiss Life Asset Managers and growth in unit-linked policies. Net inflows totalled CHF2.3bn, up 44% compared with net subscriptions in first half 2012, which contributed to growth in assets under management of 15%, to CHF24.1bn. Including mandates from Swiss Life, assets under management are up by only 1%, to CHF149.45bn. Non-annualised net earnings for the group total 2.4%, compared with 2.7% the previous year, “which represents excellent returns considering the unfavourable market parameters,” a statement says. Net profits for the group totalled CHF472m, which represents an increase of 29% compared with the previous year.
