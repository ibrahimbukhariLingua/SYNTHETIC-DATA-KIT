US prosecutors investigate “Cohen Account” at SAC Capital


The Wall Street Journal reports that US prosecutors have begun investigating transactions undertaken from an equities portfolio of about USD3bn at SAC Capital, known as the “Cohen Account,” or internally, as the “Big Book.” Prosecutors are focusing on transactions which were suggested to Steven Cohen for the portfolio by Noah Freeman and Donald Longueil, two former portfolio managers who have recently pleaded guilty to insider trading.The newspaper points out, however, that no accusations have been made against the head of the alternative management firm, or against SAC Capital. In addition, investigators don’t say that the transactions suggested by Freeman and Longueil were based on insider information, nor that Cohen knew what reasons were leading the two men to make the recommendations.
