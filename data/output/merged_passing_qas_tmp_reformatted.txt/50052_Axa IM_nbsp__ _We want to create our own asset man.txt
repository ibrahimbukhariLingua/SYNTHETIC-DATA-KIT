Axa IM&nbsp;: “We want to create our own asset management firm in China”


NEWSManagers: One of your objectives is to accelerate your international development. Where are you now?Christophe Coquema: We clearly want to pursue the globalisation of our distribution both by opening to new countries and by strengthening our presence in existing countries. We have set up a team dedicated to Scandinavian countries, for which we had relatively restricted coverage. We have also strengthened our team in Japan, where we have developed the local structure a lot by attracting new talent. We also want to strengthen our presence in the United States, which represent 50% of our global asstes in the sector, and which remain a market of fundamental innovation for the industry. Lastly, we also are considering adding to our distribution resources in emerging markets. We have already done so in Latin America, with the opening of an entity in Mexico. We have also added to our sales team in Asia.NEWSManagers: And what about China more particularly?Christophe Coquema: We already have joint ventures in China with Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and Guosheng Asset Management, and these are doing well. In parallel, we are considering developing our strategy in this country and we are currently looking at several other options. We are in the process of taking the necessary steps to obtain a license to allow us to create a Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise (WFOE) in the Luijazui free trade zone near Shanghai. We may also draw on the distrribution capacities we already have via our joint ventures to offer Axa IM investment solutions to our Chinese institutional and private wealth managemnet clients, and to meet their foreign investment needs.Read the full interview in the French version of NewsManagers: www.newsmanagers.com
