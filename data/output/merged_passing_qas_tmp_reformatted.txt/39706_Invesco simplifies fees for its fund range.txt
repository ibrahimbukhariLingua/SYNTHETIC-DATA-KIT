Invesco simplifies fees for its fund range


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Invesco Perpetual has announced a simplification of the fees for its fund range in the United Kingdom, the Financial Times reports. From 1 April, investors will only be charged once, for a fund management fee, rather than annual management commissions plus additional charges. Ian Trevers, head of retail UK at Invesco Perpetual, explains that many investors falsely believe that the annual management commissions represent the total cost of the fund.
