UBS ‘gives away’ identities of US clients to tax authorities


UBS has issued a warning to those of its US clients in danger of figuring in a list of 4,450 cases which the bank will be required to hand over to the US tax authorities, in a registered letter which is clearly marked with the name of the sender. As the US postal service is a government entity, the IRS will have no difficulty in obtaining the names of these parties without waiting for official disclosure, the weekly newsmagazine Sonntag reports. The lawyer for several of these clients, Andreas Rüd, estimates that UBS acted deliberately, and is planning to file suit against the Swiss bank.
