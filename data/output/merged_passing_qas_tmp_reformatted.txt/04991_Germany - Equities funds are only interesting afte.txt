Germany - Equities funds are only interesting after 25 years of performance history


According to the most recent statistics from the German BVI association of management firms, recent statistics suggest that these firms need 25 years to prove that German equities funds provide better performance than products specialised in other asset classes, Die Welt reports. Subscribers to bond funds in Euros or real estate funds in the past ten years have earned an average performance of 2.8%, while investors in German or global equities funds have lost an average of 3.4% or 8.1%. On 20 years, conservative and even boring products such as money markets have produced higher performance than equities funds.
