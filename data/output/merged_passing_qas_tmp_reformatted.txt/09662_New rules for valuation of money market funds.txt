New rules for valuation of money market funds


The five SEC commissioners were scheduled to vote on Wednesday on draft regulations which would require money market funds to declare minor fluctuations in their net asset value around USD1, once per month and with a 60-day gap, according to sources familiar with the matter. The Wall Street Journal reports that the move is a reaction provoked by the fact that in 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Reserve Primary Fund became the first to “break the buck,” as its value fell below USD1 per share.
