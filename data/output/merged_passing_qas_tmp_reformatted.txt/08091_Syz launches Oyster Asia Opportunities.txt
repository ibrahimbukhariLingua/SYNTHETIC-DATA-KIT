Syz launches Oyster Asia Opportunities


Tantallon Capital, in Singapore, will be the manager of the new Oyster Asia Opportunities fund from Syz & Co, a fund which will invest in Asian equities ex Japan. The sub-fund of the Luxembourg Sicav, which will initially be reserved for institutional clients, will soon be registered in several European countries, including Switzerland, which will allow it to be sold to retail clients, like other Oyster sub-funds. The manager of the fund is Siew Hua Thio, who is already in charge of a similar emerging Asia fund. The portfolio includes 30 to 60 positions, with a particular emphasis on midcaps, which are less widely monitored than the rest of the market, and have an attractive valuation level.
