Crédit Agricole Suisse prepared to make acquisition


In an interview with L’Agefi Switzerland, Christophe Gancel, director of Crédit Agricole Suisse, says that “the Crédit Agricole group would like to see us grow more quickly, particularly in wealth management activities, and particularly in Asia, where we would like to strengthen our presence, and also in the Gulf and Eastern Europe. We could grow through acquisition of teams, or - why not? - even of companies. But we think that we should still wait a little longer. 2009 will be a difficult year for asset management entities, and prices for these firms may fall. There will undoubtedly be opportunities in 2010 and 2011. Whatever the case, we will seek to acquire an entity of a certain size. It takes just as much work to run a bank with CHF3bn or CHF10bn in assets under management.”
