Institutional investors make a big gamble on accelerating climate change


Some of the world’s largest and best known investors continue to make a big gamble on accelerating climate change by investing in heavily carbon-exposed assets, while only a small minority are blazing a trail to a safer, low-carbon world.The third annual Asset Owners Disclosure Project (AODP) index of the top 500 global asset owners found that nearly a half of the funds surveyed (232) did absolutely nothing to protect investments under their stewardship from the threat of climate change.The investors were given a score ranging from AAA to D based on the feedback they provided and publicly available information. The 232 investors that made no effort to recognise or address climate risk received a score of X.Among the X-rated investors are some of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds, including the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the Government Pension Investment Fund of Japan and the China Investment Corporation.The AODP names nine asset owners as the best performers. Rated AAA, they are (in order of overall ranking): Local Government Super (Australia); KLP (Norway); CalPERS (US), ABP (The Netherlands); Environment Agency Pension Fund (UK) New York State Common Retirement Fund (US); Australian Super; PZW (The Netherlands) and AP4 (Sweden).The index lists the climate performance of the world’s largest 500 asset owners, including pension funds, insurance funds, sovereign funds, foundations and endowments. Together these funds own most of the assets in our global economy, amounting to nearly $40 trillion.“People understand that governments will not regulate carbon properly but they now realise that these massive funds at the top our financial system have legal and financial responsibilities to manage climate risks,” says Julian Poulter, AODP founder and chief executive.“Funds rated A or higher in the index are protecting their investments by engaging with the companies they own, divesting of heavily carbon-exposed assets, or deploying hedging strategies. The laggards – those rated D or X – have simply failed to calculate the odds of a “sub-clime” crisis’, he adds.
