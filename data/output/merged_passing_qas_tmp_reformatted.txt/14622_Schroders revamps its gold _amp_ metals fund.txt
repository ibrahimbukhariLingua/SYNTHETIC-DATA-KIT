Schroders revamps its gold &amp; metals fund


Schroders has re-named Schroder AS Gold & Metals Fund to Schroder AS Gold and Precious Metals Fund and changed the investment approach and objective in order to offer investors an actively managed fund focused on gold.The fund will be actively managed by Paula Bujia, a senior fund manager on the commodities team, which manages USD12.5billion in commodity funds. It will invest in a range of investment instruments including futures, swaps, physically-backed exchange traded funds (ETFs) and equities. It will be measured against a benchmark comprising 75% gold spot price and 25% gold equities (NYSE Gold Bugs Index). The fund aims to be 50-100% invested in gold, but can hold 0-50% in gold equities. It can also invest up to 33% in other precious metals, such as silver and platinum, if the fund manager believes that they will outperform gold. Finally, the fund can hold up to 33% in cash.
