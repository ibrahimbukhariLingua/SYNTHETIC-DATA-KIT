Lorenzo Gazzoletti to head Italian arm of Oddo Meriten AM


After the departure of Jürgen Mahler from Oddo Meriten AM, where he was country manager for Italy, Lorenzo Gazzoletti, deputy CEO of the asset management firm, has decided to take over the head of the Italian arm and to represent the company in Italy, Funds People Italia reports. In Italy, the office, which has EUR1.2bn in assets under management, has been transformed in to a branch. “Since Italy is not only our largest market after our two domestic markets in France and Germany, but also the market with the largest organic growth, it seemed logical, reasonable and strategic to take this responsibility over directly. And not only due to the strategic position of this market, but also because, as an Italian, it is a natural field for me,” Gazzoletti explains. “I will be taking over control of the Milan office, no longer as a startup but as a fully existing entity to be grown, and will be driving us into areas that have not been explored before, such as institutionals.” Gazzoletti also says that in the short term, he will be recruiting a senior sales representative who will be responsible for institutionals. With this arrival, the Italian team will include six people.
