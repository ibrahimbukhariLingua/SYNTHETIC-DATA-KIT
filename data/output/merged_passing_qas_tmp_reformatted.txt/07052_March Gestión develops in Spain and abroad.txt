p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Funds People reports that March Gestión has been granted a license by the CNMV to provide services in the European Economic Area, which will allow it to manage funds in Luxembourg without having a branch there, according to CEO José Luis Jiménez. The next step is to register a Sicav in Luxembourg, which will house the Vini Catena wine fund and the Terranova Sicav, the investment vehicle for the March family. To allow external clients to invest, March Gestión is joining the Allfunds Bank platform, where its funds will be available from next week.
