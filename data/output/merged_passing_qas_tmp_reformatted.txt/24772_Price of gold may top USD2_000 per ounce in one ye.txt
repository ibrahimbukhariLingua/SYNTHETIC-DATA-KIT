Price of gold may top USD2,000 per ounce in one year


Thomson Reuters GFMS, which yesterday published its 2011 report on gold, is predicting more record peaks this year, Les Echos reports. The price of gold may exceed USD2,000 per ounce later this year or in 2013. In the short term, the institute is more prudent, as after a massive average increase of 28% in 2011, the price of gold may consolidate. It is predicting an average price in first half of USD1,640 per ounce.
