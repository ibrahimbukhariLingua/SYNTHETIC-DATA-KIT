Deutsche AM overhauls management team


Deutsche Bank has announced a sudden reshuffle of the management of its asset management unit (EUR711bn), just as the unit is nearing its initial public offering, Financial Times fund management reports. Reinhard Bellet, head of products for passive management, will be leaving the firm. Pierre Cherki, head of alternative assets, and Stefan Kreuzkamp, chief investment officer for active management products, will now be co-heads of the asset management unit.The departure of Bellet surprised observers, as he had overseen the ETF activity, which has strongly outperformed this year. However, the activity has had difficulty finding a steady pace of growth in the United States, and its second-place position in Europe is threatened by Lyxor. Nicolas Moreau, CEO of Deutsche AM, says that the group is planning to unite its active, passive and alternative strategies in a single global and integrated investment platform.
