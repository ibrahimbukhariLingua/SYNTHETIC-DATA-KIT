AllianzGI to launch a second infrastructure equity fund


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Allianz Global Investors is raising capital for a second infrastructure equity fund which will be launched in December. The closed fund will be created on the same model as the AllianzGI Infrastructure Equity fund, which was fully invested at the end of 2014. The fund has a horizon of 20 years, and is invested entirely in renewable energies, and more precisely in solar and wind power. “These sectors are the leaders in renewable energies, since the technology used is mature,” explains Armin Sandhoevel, chief investment officer for infrastructure equity at AllianzGI. Geographically, the fund prefers European countries which are considered less risky, such as Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Sweden. The infrastructure equity team, founded in 2012, includes 12 professionals based in Frankfurt and Luxembourg. Over the three years to the end of September 2015, it has made ten transactions totalling over EUR430m.
