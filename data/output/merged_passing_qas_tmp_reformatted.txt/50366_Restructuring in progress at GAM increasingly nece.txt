Restructuring in progress at GAM increasingly necessary


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The ongoing reconstruction at the asset management firm GAM has become more urgent, according to CEO Alexander Friedman. The obstacles to overcome have become more numerous than initially, the head of the Swiss group told Finanz und Wirtschaft in its online edition of 10 October. The problems which GAM is facing are related to the market on the one hand, and are internal on the other. The asset management firm has some large funds which it depends on, particularly its absolute return bond strategy and the long/short equity fund. So long as the market is not moving, this is not dangerous. “But we could fall victim to our own success: a weakening of these flagships could destabilize the entire business.” According to Friedman, the recent poor performance of GAM shares is largely due to outflows of money and a fall in performance commissions. “The flows which are coming back into our largest funds are a problem which appeared before my arrival.” The measures taken to reorient are bearing fruit, “but investors want to see results first,” he says.
