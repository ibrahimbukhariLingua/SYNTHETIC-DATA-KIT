Investors bet on small independent management firms


Small, independent and specialised management firms are a growing force in asset management, Handelsblatt reports. Some institutional investors have been quick to notice this trend, and are already moving to a multi-boutique structure for their activities, as is the case at BNY Mellon and BNP Paribas Investment Partners. In Germany, Feri Finance has announced that it is interested in acquisitions. The phenomenon also extends to retail managers, such as DJE Kapital, Lingohr & Partner, Lupus Alpha, Flossbach & von Storch, each of which manage assets of less than EUR10bn. The major success story in this area remains Carmignac Gestion, which has brought in a total of EUR12.8bn in net subscriptions since the beginning of the year. Lastly, there has been a trend for managers to launch their own independent businesses. Two of them left Lups alpha to found f+m Financial, a derivatives specialist, while the former head of VCH, Michael Hallacker, is now head of Agathon Capital, which will be refocused on bond management.
