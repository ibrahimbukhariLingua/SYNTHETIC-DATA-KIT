Morgan Stanley cuts a deal with investors in MSREF VII


In order to buy more time to invest the amounts committed by investors in the real estate private equity fund MSREF VII, Morgan Stanley has agreed to lower both its fee on investments and its management commission. The firm has also agreed to reimburse about USD700m to subscribers, who include the sovereign funds GIC (Singapore) CIC (China, which had invested USD800m), and the Canada Pension Plan, the Wall Street Journal reports.The size of the fund has been reduced from USD4.7bn to USD4bn, of which only USD2.5bn are already invested. In exchange, a majority of more than two thirds of subscribers have agreed to a 12-month delay to the deadline from which Morgan Stanley would be required to reimburse all the money if assets are not wholly invested, to the end of June 2013. Morgan Stanley Real Estate Funds is reported to have initially sought an 18-month extension.
