Henderson to triple emerging market equity assets by end of year


The emerging market equities team at Henderson is expected to finish the year with USD2.5-3bn in assets, due to several “institutional success stories,” Glen Finegan, head of emerging market equities at Henderson, has announced during a visit to Paris. Assets in the unit currently total near USD800m, and they totalled USD300m in 2015, when Finegan joined Henderson from First State as an addition to the emerging markets range from the firm. “It establishes Henderson as a serious player in the area of emerging markets,” the head says.
