Bestinver puts brakes on redemptions from its funds


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Five months after the departure of its star manager Francisco Garcia Paramés, the Spanish asset management firm Bestinver has finally succeeding in slowing redemptions from its funds, and, better,, to attract new attention from investors, by highlighting the performance of its products, Cinco Dias reports. In fact, its flagship product Bestifond has earned 18.78% since the beginning of the year, while its Bestinver International fund has earned returns of 19.53% since 1 January 2015. “Our commitment is to earn the best long-term returns,” Beltran de la Lastra, the new chief investment officer at Bestinver, tells Cinco Dias. “With our ‘investing value’ management, we seek out the best returns for investors in our funds.” The Spanish website notes that the departure of Paramés in September 2014 had a negative effect on the asset management firm, in the form of a net outflow of more than EUR2.5bn. Since then, the pace of the outflows has slowed considerably, with only EUR4.2m in net redemptions in February, while March may be the first month in which Bestinver has begun to earn positive net subscriptions. “The evolution of flows is totally positive, and we can say that it has stabilized,” de la Lastra says. “What is important now is to start getting through to investors with our value proposal again.”
