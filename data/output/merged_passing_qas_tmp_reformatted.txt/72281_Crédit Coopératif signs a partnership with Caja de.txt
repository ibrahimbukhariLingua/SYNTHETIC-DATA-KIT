The agreement, signed by Christine Jacglin, CEO of Crédit Coopératif, and Joan Cavallé, CEO of Caja de Ingenieros, aims to assist the international development of their clients. The collaboration will be centred on supporting projects related to the social economy, the internationalisation of cooperative structures, sales of socially responsible investment (SRI) investment vehicles, and the sharing of best practices. The asset management firms at the two banks will be able to collaborate to distribute SRI funds, and will benefit from synergies in asset management and the economic and financial monitoring of assets, a statement says.
