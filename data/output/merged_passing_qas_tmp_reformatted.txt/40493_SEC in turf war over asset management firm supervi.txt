SEC in turf war over asset management firm supervision


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Top US officials are facing off to determine whether the asset management industry poses risks to the financial sector, and whether it therefore needs to be subject to stricter surveillance, the Wall Street Journal reports. Representatives of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who currently regulates asset management firms, are confronting a powerful but little-known office of the Treasury department which is seeking to lay the foundations for supervision of companies such as Fidelity Investments and BlackRock by the Federal Reserve. The regulatory battle, described by sources close to the situation, may complicate efforts by the US government to control non-banking companies which regulators feel may pose risks to the financial system.
