The Luxembourg-domiciled fund was launched on 31 January this year. It was presented as the first fund of its type to offer access to the onshore renminbi market, and a way to invest directly in Chinese government bonds. At the end of February, assets in the fund totalled nearly EUR34m. According to a spokesperson for Allianz GI, “demand was such that the fund was soft closed in early February, only a few days after its launch on 31 January, as the assets had reached the quota authorised by Chinese regulators.” The Onshore RMB fund is the sister produt of two other funds, Allianz Renminbi Fixed Income (Offshore) and Allianz Renminbi Currency. The Offshore fund, launched in June 2011, was closed in August 2011, after inflows of EUR450m in two months’ time. It was reopened in August 2012.
