Gen Re Capital becomes Oppenheim VAM


The acquisition of the management firm Gen Re Capital GmbH from Kölnische Rück (group Gen Re) by Bankhaus Sal. Oppenheim jr. & Cie was completed on Friday, as the necessary permission was issued by the antitrust and supervisory authorities (see Newsmanagers of 10 September 2009). Gen Re Capital (EUR11bn in assets) will now be known as Oppenheim VAM Kapalanlagegessellschaft mbH (OVAM), and will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Oppenheim Kapitalanlagegesellschaft (OKAG), which is in turn an affiliate of Sal. Oppenheim in charge of institutional management (EUR42bn). The two directors of Gen Re Capital, Andrea Simokat and Christian Finke, and most of the partners at Gen Re Capital, will join Oppenheim VAM.
