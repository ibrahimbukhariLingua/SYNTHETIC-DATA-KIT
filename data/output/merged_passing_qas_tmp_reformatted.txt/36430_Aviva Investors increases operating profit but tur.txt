Aviva Investors increases operating profit but turnaround takes time


Operating profit at Aviva Investors increased 32% to £41 million (HY13: £31 million), due to higher performance fees and the transfer of some of the retail fund management business from UK Life, said the group this morning. The business had assets under management at HY14 of £234 billion, with £1.7 billion of net external outflows (excluding the impact of the River Road disposal) experienced in the period, primarily due to rotation out of global high yield, convertibles and emerging market debt. The turnaround at Aviva Investors is, as previously communicated, likely to take time but the launch of the Aviva Investors Multi Strategy fund range is an important milestone.
