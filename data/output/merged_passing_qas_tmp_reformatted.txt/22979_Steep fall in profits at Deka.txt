Steep fall in profits at Deka


DekaBank, which has recently been decapitated as the chairman of its board, Franz S. Waas, was dismissed on 2 April, has posted an “economic profit” (pre-tax profit by IFRS accounting standards, plus the results of a valuation of financial instruments) in free-fall in 2011, down 58.6% to EUR383.1m, and net redemptions of EUR5.861bn, compared with net subscriptions of EUR908m, Oliver Behrens, interim chairman of the board, has announced.Real estate funds had net subscriptions of EUR965m (and EUR650m in first quarter 2012), while securities funds saw net outflows of EUR6.8bn, compared with EUR793m in 2010.The central asset management firm for the German savings bank is planning to react to these outflows from its open-ended funds firstly by accelerating its Vermögenskonzept structured products programme, which has already attracted EUR870m in assets since 2007, and secondly by extending its custom product ranges, with the help of the savings banks network, which now controls all of the capital in Deka, previously 50% owned by the Landesbanken.
