Fidelity wants to maintain bundled commissions


Fidelity International would like to maintain the coexistence of bundled and non-bundled commissions, Fund Strategy reports. Following the publication of a working document by the British Financial Services Authority (FSA) on the subject of distribution platforms which raises the question of commissions, the management firm has undertaken a survey of 350 British independent financial advisers (IFAs) which finds that 80% of them favour the status quo. Two thirds of advisers estimate that the cost of investments would rise if the FSA intervened to forbid kickbacks.
