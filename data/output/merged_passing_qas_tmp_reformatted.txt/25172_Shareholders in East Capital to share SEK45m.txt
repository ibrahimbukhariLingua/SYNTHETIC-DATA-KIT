Shareholders in East Capital to share SEK45m


Four shareholders in East Capital will share SEK45m (or about EUR5m) after an appreciation of one of the stakes in East Capital Explorer, the Russian fashion house Melon Fashion Group, dagens Industri reports. On Friday, East Capital Explorer (ECEX) announced that Melon Fashion Group had seen its value rise by 59% per share. Since ECEX owns 36% of Melon, this represents a windfall for the asset management firm. But those who are making the most on the operation are the owners of East Capital: Peter Elam HÃ¥kansson, Kestutis Sasnauskas, Karine Hirn and Jacob Grapengiesser. Observing that Melon Fashion Group is not listed on the stock market, Dagens Industri asked East Capital who decided to revalue the Russian firm. The firm responded that it had employed an external valuation agency.
