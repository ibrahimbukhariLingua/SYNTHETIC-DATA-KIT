Private bankers look abroad for solutions ahead of tax hike


“Our duty, while remaining in strictest conformity with the law, is to offer our clients the simplest and most tax-effective solutions we can,” says Iñigo Susaeta, managing partner at Arcano Investment Advisor, speaking of the position of all Spanish private banks on the eve of the announcement by the Spanish PM, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, that taxes on high net worth families will be raised in the next few weeks. Expansión reports that among the expected new tax measures will be a return of wealth tax (1% to 1.5% on wealth of over EUR0.9m), an increase in income tax, an increase in the tax on Sicav vehicles (currently 1%), an increase in capital gains tax (from 18% to 19% or 21%) for gains above EUR6,000, and/or a reimposition of tolls when transferring investments from one fund to another. To face up to these developments, private banks, which manage EUR325bn for Spanish clients, will primarily offer Irish and Luxembourg-registered funds, especially Luxembourg-registered special investment funds (SIFs). But these vehicles cost EUR27,000 to set up, and EUR50,000 to EUR60,000 per year to maintain, in addition to which there is also a management commission.
