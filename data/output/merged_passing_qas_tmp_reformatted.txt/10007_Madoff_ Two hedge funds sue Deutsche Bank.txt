Madoff: Two hedge funds sue Deutsche Bank


Two hedge funds, Kingate Global Fund and Kingate Euro Fund, have sued Deutsche Bank, accusing it of refusing to honour a commitment to buy up their claims for losses in the Bernard Madoff case for USD1bn, the Wall Street Journal reports. Under the agreement, Deutsche Bank would have been required to but up USD1.6bn in debt for USD1.1bn. But since then, a series of court verdicts has limited the ability of the court-appointed trustee for Madoff to recuperate money for investors.
