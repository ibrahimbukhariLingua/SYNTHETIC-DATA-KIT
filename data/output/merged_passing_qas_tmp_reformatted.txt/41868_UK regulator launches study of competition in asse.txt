UK regulator launches study of competition in asset management sector


The Financial Conduct Authority, the British financial market authority, on Wednesday presented a general outline of its major study of competition in the British asset management sector, announced in March 2015 as part of its 2015-2016 business plan.Three major topics will be analysed: “how asset managers compete to deliver value; whether asset managers are willing and able to control costs and quality along the value chain; how investment consultants affect competition for institutional asset management.“Across all three topics the FCA is interested in understanding whether there are any barriers to innovation or technological advances which may be preventing new ways of doing business that could benefit investors,” the FCA says.The study will include both the retail and institutional markets."Asset managers provide an important economic function, bringing together those with money to invest and companies and governments that need capital. Given the significant role they play in the economy, it is essential that competition works effectively for these services,» Christopher Woolard, director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said.“The UK is a world leader in asset management. Our market study aims to ensure that both retail and institutional investors can get value for money when purchasing these services – which we expect to further strengthen the UK’s position as a major centre for asset management.”The decision to undertake a market study of the asset management sector comes out of an effort to deliver responses to several issues observed by the FCA, such as difficulties on the part of investors in ensuring that they are obtaining a good price/quality ratio, of controlling the performance of asset management firms, as well as the role of consultants and potential conflicts of interest arising from the provision of advising and asset management services.The FCA aims to publish an interim report in summer 2016 and a final report in early 2017.
