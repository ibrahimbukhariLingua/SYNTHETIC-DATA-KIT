Deka offers profiled wealth management solutions


From May, 2012, DekaBank, seeking to win back at least some of the ground it has lost (see article in todayâ€™s Newsmanagers), is offering retail clients of Deka-BasisAnlage a combination of profiled unit-linked wealth management with ease of use and minimal subscription fees. The Deka-BasisAnlage A20 product will be 20% invested in equity funds, while the A40 will invest up to 40% in equities, the A60 up to 60%, and the VL, 60% to 100%. The universe includes about 1,000 investment funds (equities, bonds and money markets).For the first three variants, the central asset management firm for the German savings banks is aiming for capital preservation over a pre-defined horizon excluding front-end fees, with 4 years for the A20, 6 years for the A40 and 8 years for the A60. For the VL fund, there is no guarantee of capital preservation. The system includes a high watermark which retains the highest levels reached by each portfolio, regardless of the date of subscription.The various products are available in the form of savings plans from EUR25 per month, or with a single initial payment of EUR50.Front-end fees depend on the proportion of the fund invested in equities, with 2% for the A20 version, 3% for the A40, 4% for the A60 and 5% for the VL version, with management commissions of 0.50% (a20), 0.60% (A40), 0.75% (A60) and 0.90% (VL). All versions charge a fee of 0.10%.
