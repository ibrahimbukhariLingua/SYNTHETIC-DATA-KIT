Horizon AM performs an additional renovation operation in Germany


The French asset management firm Horizon AM, a specialist in private equity investment in residential real estate in France and Germany, has announced that it is financing a new operation in Berlin, consisting of renovating a factory which is a historic monument into a senior residence, with a new residential programme. The redevelopment will be financed via the fund Opportunit√© Pierre 2 and a bond issue serving institutional investors.The project comes as part of a strategy at Horizon AM to invest in markets with high added value. Like other major German cities, Berlin is facing a significant shortage in housing due to its strong economic and demographic growth. In this environment, the renovation operation undertaken by Dolphin Trust, an expert in renovation of historic buildings, will have an ideal location in the prized Steglitz district, less than 30 minutes from the city centre. The future high-end residence on the side of the Teltow canal will have 50 mooring places on the water, contributing to the exceptional level of the project.
