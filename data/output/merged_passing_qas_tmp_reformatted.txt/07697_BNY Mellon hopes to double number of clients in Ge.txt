BNY Mellon hopes to double number of clients in Germany


In an interview with the BÃ¶rsen-Zeitung, Timothy Keaney, Chairman Europa, Chief Global Client Management Officer and Co-Chief Executive Officer de BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, says that the BNY Mellon group is planning to bring the number of clients for all its sectors of activity in Germany up to 350-400, from 200 presently. He sees major potential for collateral management services and alternative assets. This growth will be sustained by the acqusition of BHF Servicing for EUR250m, which will be completed by 1 August. No clients of BHF Asset Servicing have left as a result of the acquisition. At the close of the transaction, BNY Mellon will have EUR473bn under custody or administration in Germany.
