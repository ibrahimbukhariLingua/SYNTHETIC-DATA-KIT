Mark Mobius remains confident in emerging market equities


Mark Mobius, portfolio manager and executive director of the Templeton Emerging Market Group (Franklin Resources), in a presentation in Paris has emphasized all the advantages of emerging market equities: growth far higher than that from developed countries, ample currency reserves (which are gradually used to make acquisitions of assets in Europe), lower debt than in industrialised countries, inflation which has fallen steeply, and moderate valuations, at multiples of under 10.The star manager from Franklin Templeton, who as a general rule invests on a five-year horizon (his turnover rate is generally below 20%), claims two themes should be preferred: one the one hand, demography and consumer spending, and on the other hand, commodities, whose prices are mostly on an upward trend. Over the past 20 years, this applies to the CRB index as well as to copper, platinum, palladium, mickel, sugar, soy, corn, rice, wheat, gold and oil.The Emerging Market Group at Franklin Resources has assets of USD45bn in shares in companies which make at least 50% of their earnings in emerging markets. It also extends to local companies and to a small number of Western groups, including some locally listed affiliates of firms from industrialised countries.
