Russell creates a series of volatility indices


The US firm Russell Investments (USD141bn in assets) has announced the launch of a family of Russell Volatility Control Index Series indices, which will aim to allow investors to better deploy a strategy based on a volatility objective.The new indices put the returns on equity markets in perspective with a dynamic allocation between an underlying Russsell index and investment in cash. Ultimately, the index provides a way to limit risks in periods of increased volatility on the markets, and to maximise exposure to the market when volatility is low.In addition, says Russell, these indices have the advantage of being totally customisable, which allows clients to set a custom risk exposure target for every Russell international or US equities index.
