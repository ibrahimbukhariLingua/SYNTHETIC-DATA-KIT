Unigestion to absorb cost of external research


Unigestion has announced that it will pay for all investment research on behalf of its clients in line with the upcoming Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II. MiFID II, which comes into effect from 3 January 2018 for all asset managers operating in the European Union, brings about important changes to the regulation of investment research. The Directive’s rules essentially lay out three options for how firms can account for the payment of investment research ranging from paying for it from their own Profit and Loss (P&L) to charging clients directly through a Research Payment Account (RPA). “Unigestion has opted to pay for all investment research from its own P&L as this approach is consistent with the firm’s core value of always putting its clients first”. This decision will not result in any change in management fees.
