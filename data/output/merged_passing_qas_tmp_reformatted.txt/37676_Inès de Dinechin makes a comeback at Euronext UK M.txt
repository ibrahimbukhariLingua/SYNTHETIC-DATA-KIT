Inès de Dinechin makes a comeback at Euronext UK Markets


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Inès de Dinechin, who left her position as chairman of Lyxor Asset Management in February 2014, has been appointed to the board of directors for the London trading market operated by Euronext, Financial News reports, citing documents submitted to Companies House. De Dinechin is one of four people who have been selected to join the board of directors at Euronext UK Markets. Andrew Cornthwaite, currently responsible for international coverage and international banking activities at the Russian VTB Capital group, has joined the board of directors at Euronext UK Markets. The two other appointments are John Gollan, former director of the NYSE Liffe derivatives market and non-executive director at Merrill Lynch International, and Keith Robinson, a former accountant who previously sat on the board of directors at the trading platform Smartpool, controlled by NYSE. Euronext UK Markets was established in London last year to take control of NYSE Euronext London, a stock market founded in July 2010 to target international companies. It will be part of the new independent Euronext, whose initial public offering is expected in summer 2014 (see elsewhere in Newsmanagers of 28 May 2014).
