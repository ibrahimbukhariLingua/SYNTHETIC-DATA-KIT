Hedge fund manager endorses Bitcoin


Michael Novogratz, co-chief investment officers of macro funds at Fortress Investment Group, has publicly supported the virtual currency Bitcoin, at a conference in New York, the Financial Times reports. He says he personally invested in the currency three months ago. However, Fortress felt that it was too speculative to do itself. Among other investors in Bitcoin are the Winklevoss twins, who are working to launch an ETF backed by the currency.
