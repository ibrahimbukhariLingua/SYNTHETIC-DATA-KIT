Financière de l’Echiquier aims for EUR1bn in Italy


In a video interview with Bluerating, Paolo Sarno, who has been appointed as country head of Financière de l’Echiquier in Italy, says that he is aiming for EUR1bn in assets under management in the country. The French firm, which has EUR7.5bn in assets, has just opened an office in Milan, which is also its first office abroad. Italy is its second-largest country in terms of assets, after France. The Italian experiment by La Financière de l’Echiquier began nearly 10 years ago, with the distribution of the firtst funds via an Italian insurance firm. Sarno joined the firm in 2006, and there are now three people covering the Italian market for the French boutique. Sarno says that if the Italian experiement is a success, La Financière de l’Echiquier will open other offices in other countries, such as Switzerland, Belgium and Germand, where the firm already has its funds on sale.
