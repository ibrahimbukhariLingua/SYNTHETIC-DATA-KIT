Deka funds show weak results


In the Feri rankings as of 31 March, only 28% of the Deka product range gets top ratings (A or B), compared with 43% one year ago, and the asset management firm for the German savings banks has fallen from sixth to 20th place out of the 35 largest fund management firms, Handelsblatt reports.The decline in performance, which is noticeable for equities as well as bond products, is due to the defensive investment policy sought by the CEO of Deka-Investment, Thomas Neiße, a policy which is more suitable for the savings banks, which are in a process of taking control of all capital in Deka. Neiße is concerned to “avoid disasters first and foremost, even if that could have a cost in terms of performance.”
