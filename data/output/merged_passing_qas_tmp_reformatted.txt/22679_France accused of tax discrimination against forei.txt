France accused of tax discrimination against foreign funds


On 10 May, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) will pronounce a verdict on the difference in tax status for foreign OPCVM mutual funds and French-registered funds in France, Les Echos reports. The latter category of funds will not be taxed on dividends paid by French businesses, unlike the former. For over six years, foreign firms have been denouncing this imbalance. The French tax authorities have already received more than 10,000 reimbursement applications for this withholding tax, for total rebates of about EUR4.2bn, including interest, equivalent to 0.2% of French gross domestic product in 2010.
