Man Group to free up owners’ equity through change in legal status


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } Man Group on 11 April announced that a change to its regulatory status, which will result in a limitation of its licensed field of action, will allow it to free up about EUR550m in owners’ equity.The reduction in regulatory owners’ equity reflects a change in the activities of Man Group, to require less owners’ equity than in previous years, such as for seed capital activities or for guaranteed products.Man Group states, however, that the new legal status has yet to be approved by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), probably in third quarter.Pending confirmation of the figures advanced, excess owners’ equity at Man Group may total about USD920m as of 1 January 2014, an increase in the cushion of about USD550m.
