IMA welcomes Lord Turner’s proposals


The chairman of the British management association IMA, Richard Saunders, has welcomed the proposals of Lord Turner for improved regulatory framework for financial activities. “Lord Turner has very correctly identified the need for banks to do a better job of managing risks and to maintain higher levels of owners’ equity when they engage in higher-risk activities,” said the chairman of the association. “We welcome the debate. However, taxes on transactions also carry risk that, as for stamp taxes, the savings investor will ultimately pay the price. In the debate to come, this factor must also be taken into account,” Richard Saunders continues.
