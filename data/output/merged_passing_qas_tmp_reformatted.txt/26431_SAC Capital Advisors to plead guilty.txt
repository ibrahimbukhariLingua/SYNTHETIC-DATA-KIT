SAC Capital Advisors to plead guilty


SAC Capital Advisors will plead guilty to securities fraud as part of an agreement with US Federal prosecutors which will be announced next week, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing sources familiar with the matter. The exact timing for the agreement has not yet been set, but it may be revealed by the end of the week. SAC will also agree to stop managing money coming from outside, and to pay penal fines of about USD1.2bn. This will be the largest fine ever paid. SAC had previously denied all accusations and claimed that Steve Cohen had done nothing.
