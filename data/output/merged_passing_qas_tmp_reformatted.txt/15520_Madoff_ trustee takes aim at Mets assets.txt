Madoff: trustee takes aim at Mets assets


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Negotiations towards an out-of-court settlement have collapsed, and Irving Picard, the legally-appointed trustee for the business interests of Bernard Madoff, on Friday released further details of accusations against Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, the largest shareholders in the New York Mets baseball team. The Wall Street Journal reports that Picard claims the men must have known for years that Madoffâ€™s activities were fraudulent. In addition, he accuses them of subsequently carrying out a plan to put their assets out of reach of confiscation once the fraud was discovered.
