Fed wants to team up with money market funds


The Federal Reserve is looking to team up with the money-market mutual fund industry as part of its strategy to ensure that its unconventional policies to stimulate the economy do not produce a bout of post-crisis inflation. So says the Financial Times. The central bank considers eventually draining liquidity from the financial system by engaging in “reverse repos” with the money-market funds. In these, the Fed would pledge mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries acquired during the crisis as collateral for short-term loans from the funds.
