Julius Baer plans to acquire Banque Sarasin


The Zurich-based private bank Juiuls Baer is planning to acquire other businesses. In an interview published on 19 November in Le Temps, CEO Boris Collardi says that Banque Sarasin would suit its requirements. “Only one financial sector actor is likely to be involved in the acquisition” of Banque Sarasin, says Collardi. “There would be no point” if Raiffeisen, for example, acquired one third of capital while Julius Baer bought the remaining two thirds. The Swiss newspaper Tagesanzeiger, cited by Agefi, reports that twelve top heads at the Swiss private bank Sarasin, including CEO Joachim Straehle, have sent a letter to the board of directors to address the acquisition proposal from Julius Baer. Sarasin last month said that Rabobank was studying all options for its 46% stake in its capital, which is equivalent to 68% of voting rights.
