Investors continuing to pile into equities


What a surprise! As in previous weeks, investors are continuing to privilege equities. In the week to 24 January, equity funds posted record inflows of USD33.2bn, the highest ever weekly total on existing records, according to the weekly Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey, based on data from the global flow evolution monitoring specialist EPFR Global. The statistics show that ETFs attracted slightly over USD21bn, and that open funds show net inflows totalling a record USD12.2bn.However, the wave of euphoria on equity markets seems to be nearing its peak. The synthetic “Bull & Bear” indicator published by BofA Merrill Lynch is now at 7.9, its highest level since March 2013. This is near its level of 8, which Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts consider a sell signal. In other words, a market correction, at least for the S&P 500, seems to be increasingly probable. Analysts warn that the US dollar may be a trigger for this correction, as was the case in the stock market crash of 1987, in the midst of controversy between US and European leaders.Funds specialised in European equities have attracted USD4.6bn, the largest level recorded in the past 37 weeks, while emerging market equity funds have attracted USD8.1bn, their second-largest total ever. US equity funds, for their part, show net inflows of USD7bn. Bond funds have seen total net inflows of USD4bn. Investment grade bond funds attracted USD2bn, and emerging market debt funds USD1.6bn. Inflation-linked bond funds have continued to attract investors, this week totalling a record USD1.7bn. However, high yield bond funds have seen net outflows totalling USD2.5bn.
