Pierre-Henri Flamand joins Man Group


Man Group announced, in a statement released on its site, that it has recruited the former Goldman Sachs trader Pierre-Henri Flamand, who at the end of 2012 announced plans to close his hedge fund, Edoma Partners, launched two years previously. Flamand will in June join GLG, whose assets under management total slightly over USD30bn, as senior portfolio manager, a statement says. At Goldman Sachs, Flamand worked with Manny Roman, who was then a partner at the US bank, and is now head of Man Group.
