Euro has a one-in-five chance of surviving the next ten years


The euro has only a 20% chance of surviving in its current form for the next ten years, according to the British research institute CEBR (Centre for Economics and Business Research), which on 31 December published its ten major predictions for 2011.In its commentary on the euro, at the top of the list of predictions, the CEBR points out that Spain and Italy will need to refinance EUR400bn of their debt in spring, which could potentially create a new crisis in the euro zone. The euro may disintegrate at that time, even if European directors are capable of responding to such a crisis.“If the euro does not fall apart, 2011 could be the year when it weakens substantially, towards parity with the dollar,” says the CEO of the CEBR, Douglas McWilliams. “I think that the thing which will put an end to the euro will be the failure of most countries to adopt remedies that include the necessary constraints to make their economies competitive over the longer term,” the CEBR chief explains.The British think tank estimates that Germany will continue to play the role of a super-star in the Western world. It points out that the success of the German economy is partly due to the contribution of its immigrants, particularly from Turkey. However, Japan, whose debt now represents 200% of its GNP, may be facing a new financial crisis.The CEBR gives itself a positive verdict on its predictions for 2010, but admits that its sporting predictions were nearly all wrong. For 2011, the CEBR is nonetheless giving it another try. In football, it plucks for Manchester United for the British championship, and Real Madrid for the European title. New Zealand will beat Australia in the rugby world cup final, it says.
