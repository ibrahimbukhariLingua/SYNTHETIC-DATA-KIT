Fundsdepotbank takes over settlement for Veritas share accounts


Fondsdepotbank, a joint venture of Xchanging and Allianz Global Investors (AGI), announced on Friday that Veritas Investment Trust, a former affiliate of Société Générale, has contracted it from 15 August 2010 to provide transaction settlement for approximately 100,000 client accounts. Veritas products, including the fund of funds A2A and the ETF Dachfonds, are distributed by about 280 partners on the German and Austrian markets. In January, Fondsdepotbank already took over management of transactions for shares in investment funds for SEB Bank and SEB Asset Management. With these partners, Fundsdepotbank was already handling 1.5 million accounts and EUR30bn in assets under administration. The migration of the new accounts will take place gradually until 31 December this year, as MEAG, the management firm for Munich Re, has also decided to transfer 151,000 accounts to Fondsdepotbank.
