Russell carries out a transition operation for Réunica


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } After the success of its transition management operation for GIE Agirc-Arrco in 2013, the asset management firm Russell Investments France has announced that it has finalised a transition management operation involving more than EUR900m for the social protection group Réunica, as part of a revision of part of its asset allocation. The large-scale operation involved transferring EUR900m from two diversified euro zone FCP funds into three new funds: one diversified euro zone fund, one index-based euro zone equity fund, and one index-based euro zone bond fund, a statement says. The operation also included an interim portfolio phase, during which Russell provided passive asset management, in line with the group’s global strategic allocation. “ … Our engineering made it possible to instantaneously achieve the target allocation as soon as outgoing portfolios were taken up, to reduce transaction costs and the level of tracking error, taking the differences in profile between the portfolios into account,” explains Patrick Lajoinie, deputy CEO of Russell Investments France. “In the past three years, we have seen constant growth in demand for our transition management services. We are consequently continuing to reinforce our European teams, in order to support our growth and to respond to the growing complexity of the mandates we are being awarded. As a part of this, two transition managers joined our teams in London in early September,” says Dominique Dorlipo, chairman of Russell Investments France.
