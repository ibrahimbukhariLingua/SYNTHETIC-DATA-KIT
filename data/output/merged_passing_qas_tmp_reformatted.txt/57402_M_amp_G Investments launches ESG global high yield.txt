M&amp;G Investments launches ESG global high yield fund


M&G Investments announces the launch of a fund focusing on the global high yield market that will incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. ESG considerations are fully integrated in the investment process through a 3 - stage screen. The first stage excludes companies in breach of the United Nations Global Compact principles. The second layer filters out companies that derive their revenue from specific sectors: tobacco, alcohol, adult entertainment, gambling, thermal coal, defence and weapons. The third stage filters companies according to their ESG credentials based on ratings provided by MSCI.Due to a comprehensive assessment of a range of ESG factors, the fund will exclude any companies that are classified as industry laggards displaying poor ESG credentials compared to its industry peers. This stage involves a sophisticated analysis of a wide range of complex issues, which might cover everything from energy efficiency and pollution to working conditions and product safety. The strategy will be co - managed by James Tomlins and Stefan Isaacs, who account for over 28 years of experience of investing in high yield, and will be supported by M&Gâ€™s extensive capabilities in the credit space. The fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in global high yield bonds to form a flexible and highly diversified portfolio in terms of issuers, geographies and sectors.
