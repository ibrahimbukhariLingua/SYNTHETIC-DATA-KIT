BlackRock and its affiliates now control 5.72% of Daimler


In a market statement published on the DGAP website on 18 August, Daimler announced that it has received notification that the BlackRock group on 11 August passed the 5% threshold in voting rights, and with its affiliates now controls 5.72% of the auto maker. The US management firm probably took advantage of a slump of about one third in Daimlerâ€™s share price since mid-July to increase its stake. BlackRock becomes the third-largest shareholder in Daimler, after Aabar Investments (Abu Dhabi) with 9%, and the Kuwait sovereign fund (7%), ahead of Renault/Nissan, which controls 3.1%.
