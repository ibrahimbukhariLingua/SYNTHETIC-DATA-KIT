Modifications to two Petercam funds


Petercam has announced that the Petercam Equities European Convergence fund has been renamed as Petercam Equities EM EMEA (Emerging Markets Europe, Middle East & Africa). The modification is related to an extension of the fund’s investment universe to include the Middle East & Africa.The strategy of another fund, the Petercam L Bonds Universalis, is also changing, to place the emphasis on balanced investment in bonds (risk and volatility control as part of optimized risk adjustment), as well as opportunistic investment (global “total return” profiles).
