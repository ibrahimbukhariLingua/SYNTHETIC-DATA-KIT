p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Singapore-based banking groups DBS Group Holdings and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp, and the Swiss bank Julius Baer have made non-binding offers for the Asian wealth management affiliate of Barclays, the Reuters news agency has learned from sources familiar with the matter. These preliminary offers for the affiliate of the British bank, based in Singapore and valued at about USD600m (EUR530m), were submitted last week, according to sources who prefer to remain anonymous. None of the banks concerned had any comment. The sale comes as part of a restructuring programme luanched by the new CEO of Barclays, Joe Staley. Several European banks are cutting back in Asia as part of a cost-reduction policy impopsed by the difficulties they have been experiencing in Europe in an extremely low interest rate environment. Sources had previously told Reuters that Credit Suisse may also be interested in the Asian affiliate being put up for sale by Barclays. It was not immediately possible to determine whether Credit Suisse has also made a bid. The bank did not wish to comment.
