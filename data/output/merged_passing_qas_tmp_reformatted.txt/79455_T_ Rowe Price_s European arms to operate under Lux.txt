T. Rowe Price’s European arms to operate under Luxembourg umbrella


The offices of US asset management company T. Rowe Price, located in Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, will all be operating under a Luxembourg license as from now on, according to InvestmentEurope. The move aims at responding any no-deal Brexit challenge. The concerned units were hitherto controlled by T. Rowe Price’s British base. The UK-based branch of T. Rowe Price, TRPIL, will also transfer control to its Luxembourgish counterpart, TRPSARL, effective 1 March 2019. Other asset managers such as Capital Group and Schroders have made similar moves in recent weeks.
