Axa announces UK layoffs


La Tribune reports that Axa Insurance, the British affiliate of the French insurance firm, yesterday announced the suppression of 560 jobs in the United Kingdom to come in the next few months. “We will have to cut product lines which have not been successful and which are unprofitable,” says the head of the affiliate, Philippe Maso, cited in the newspaper. Less than half of the announced job cuts will be achieved through layoffs.
