Euribor: ECB wants a new method of calculating inter-bank lending rates


In the midst of the Libor scandal, the European Central Bank (ECB) is putting pressure on the officials responsible for the Euribor to revise the way in which the rate is calculated, Reuters leaned yesterday, citing sources familiar with the matter. The ECB is calling for the current mode of calculating Euribor, which is based on banks estimating the rates they are required to pay to borrow, to be abandoned, in favour of a system based on the rates actually paid. The regulatory authorities are afraid that the current mechanism is too open to manipulation. “The big question is whether we want declared rates or real rates … so that at the end of the day, banks will say what operations they undertook at what price,” a source at the central bank explained. “If we use actual transactions, we will have solved the problem.” The ECB is the natural candidate to oversee Euribor, Reuters states.
