Willis Towers Watson launches an equity fund for institutionals


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Willis Towers Watson on 20 June announced the launch of an equity fund dedicated to institutional investors, which combines the best unconstrained equity ideas from the best stock-pickers in the world. The new fund, entitled Global Equity Focus Fund (GEFF), comes in the wake of five other funds of this type, including a multi-asset class diversified fund (which has a 10-year track record), liquid alternative funds, and an alternative credit fund, which include the best investment ideas from Willis Towers Watson. The new fund, which offers daily liquidity, includes the “top 10” equities out of 15 picks from eight top stock-pickers, with the risk managed across the portfolio. “Our new equity range is designed especially to provide institutional investors with targeted access to the best equity ideas in the world, with high levels of transparency on the underlying investments, at competitive prices. This meets our desire to assist all of our clients, - either advising our outsourcing, - and to earn the best returns after commissions for an appropriate level of risk. And if the vehicles do not exist, we will construct them,” explains Paul Berriman, global head of fund activities at Willis Towers Watson, cited in a statement.
