Debt crisis has eroded the credit quality of European businesses


A deterioration in the quality of credit from European businesses has been relatively marked in the first half of the year, even though few of these businesses have defaulted, the financial ratings agency Standard & Poor’s reports in a new study (“Europe’s Sovereign Crisis Continues to Erode Credit Quality.”) In the first nine months of the year, there were four ratings downgrades for every one ratings upgrade among both financial and non-financial sector businesses, compared with a ratio of about one to two in the previous two years. Continued access to financing will be a key factor in maintaining this default level, particularly in light of an increase in debt maturing in the next two years, the study finds. In September 2012, the default rate for businesses rated speculative grade was 2.3%, compared with 1.6% at the end of 2011, and 1% in 2010. On 2012, investors accepted a slight increase in their exposure to risk, when they could expect higher returns. That offset weak earnings and reduced refinancing risks, particularly for businesses at the bottom of the ratings scale.
