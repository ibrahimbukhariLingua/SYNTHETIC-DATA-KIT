ECB to play a key role in supervision of euro zone banks


The European Commission on 12 September laid out its proposals to create a a single supervisory mechanism (SSM) for banks in the euro area. As a part of the new single mechanism, the European Central Bank will be ultimately responsible for specific surveillance activities concerning financial stability of all euro zone banks. The national supervisory authorities will continue to play an important role in ongoing surveillance of banks, as well as developing and applying ECB decisions. The Commission has also proposed that the European banking authority (EBA) should create a Single Supervisory Handbook to preserve the integrity of the single market and to ensure coherent bank surveillance in the 27 EU countries. The Commission calls on the Council and European Parliament to adopt the proposed regulations by the end of 2012, together with the other three components of an integrated «banking union» – the single rulebook in the form of capital requirements, harmonized deposit protection schemes, and a single European recovery and resolution framework.
