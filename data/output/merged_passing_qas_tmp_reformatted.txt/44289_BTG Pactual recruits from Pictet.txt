p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Brazilian BTG Pactual group has recruited Yves Bonzon, chief investment officer (CIO) of the wealth management division at Pictet, Financial News reports. Bonzon will become a partner at BSI, the Swiss private bank acquired by the Brazilian group from Generali, and will become CIO under the usual terms. Bonzon had worked for a quarter of a century at Pictet, where he had been director of the investment committee at the private bank since 1998. He will be leaving the Swiss group within the next few months. Assets under management at BSI total CHF90bn, compared with assets of about CHF435bn at Pictet. But heads at BTG Pactual have recently announced that they are planning to massively invest in BSI, to make the Swiss private bank the centre of expertise for wealth management for the Brazilian group.
