Pictet confirms strategy of growth without acquisition


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } The Swiss private bank Pictet & Cie is not making acquisitions of other banks a priority. “We have demonstrated that we can growth without acquisition,” says senior partner Jacques de Saussure in an interview published on 10 October in the newspaper Handelsblatt. “Few acquisitions of banks are crowned with success, and the risks are high,” de Saussure comments. If a good occasion should arise, the bank will seize it, the partner concedes. “Acquisitions are, however, not at the heart of our growth strategy.” Many banks are already encountering problems inherited from the past. “We don’t want to impose those on ourselves,” the banker says. De Saussure also remains confident on the subject of the bank’s taxation conflict with the United States. “We are convinced that we acted in a reasonable and responsible manner.” The legal action may last two more years.
