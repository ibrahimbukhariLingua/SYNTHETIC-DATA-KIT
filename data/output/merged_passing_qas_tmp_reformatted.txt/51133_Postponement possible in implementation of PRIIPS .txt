Postponement possible in implementation of PRIIPS regulations


The economic and financial committee of the European Parliament (ECON) on Thursday, 1 September, as part of its work on PRIIPS regulations, asked the European Commission to propose new technical standards (RTS) to integrate more transparency and accuracy for retail investors than they receive at present. “Although this vote has yet to be confirmed in a full session of Parliament, it renders the timetable for the application of PRIIPS regulations, initially set for 31 December this year,” the French association for stock market derivative products (AFPDB) says in a statement. If the work of the commission does not meet with the approval of Parliament, or if due to the scale of the task, the job is not completed in time for the plenary session of Parliament, the body will most likely ratify the position which went to a vote on Thursday this week. In the absence of objections from the European Union Council, the European Commission will be expected to ask expert groups to rework the RTS. The unknown factors are related to the length of the mandate, which may be longer or shorter, or may be limited to the points cited by the ECON committee; or it may call for a complete rewrite of RTS. In the past few weeks, numerous professional associations have spoken out in favour of a postponement. The request is on the grounds of the time required for the technical implementation of the new rules, though many clauses are still not laid out in detail in RTS. The AFPDB states that it supports this position.
