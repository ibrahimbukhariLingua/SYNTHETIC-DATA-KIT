Avenue Capital raises USD2bn for a European fund


Avenue Capital, which invests in distressed corporate and government debt, has raised USD2bn for its second European fund, the Financial Times reports. The asset management firm is planning to create a platform which would buy up private sector debt connected to European governments. For example, the Spanish, Greek, Italian and Portuguese health sectors owe EUR25bn to major pharmaceutical companies. Avenue would create an independent entity which would buy up risk from pharmaceutical companies, and would then deal with governments to collect on the debts.
