Santander to strengthen management affiliate


Juan Alcaraz, CEO of Santander Asset Management and the Allfunds Bank platform, has told Expansión that he hopes to make Santander AM more competitive globally in several asset classes, such as Latin American and Spanish equities, European large caps, bonds from these regions, and money market products. Other asset classes will be covered by funds from third-party managers specialised in those areas, such as European small and midcaps, some categories of bonds, and convertible bonds. This will lead to an increase in multi-management teams in Madrid, led by Marta Pérez Cogollos, and in London, where a top director will need to be recruited. Santander AM is also planning to recruit more managers for Latin American equities, emerging market bonds, and corporate bonds, as well as a CIO for Spain and a global head of sales. Alcaraz has also announced that the Spanish asset management firm will open a branch office in Tokyo, to serve Asian investors interested in Santander AM’s Latin American specialties. If this experiment is a success, other offices will be opened in Asia.
