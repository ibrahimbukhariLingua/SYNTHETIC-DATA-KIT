LGT goes into fund distribution in Germany


BaFin has issued a license to LGT Capital Management, which now allows for distribution of funds in Germany from Frankfurt, where the firm already has four managers, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. Torsten de Santos, CEO of the management firm which serves as a family office for the royal family of Liechtenstein, estimates that it is realistic to aim for EUR2bn in assets in Germany in the next five years. Unlike LGT Capital Partners, which is specialised in hedge funds and private equity, LGT Capital Management (EUR13bn in assets) is concentrated on traditional investment funds, which will be offered largely to pension funds and employers via a network of eight LGT Bank branches in Germany.
