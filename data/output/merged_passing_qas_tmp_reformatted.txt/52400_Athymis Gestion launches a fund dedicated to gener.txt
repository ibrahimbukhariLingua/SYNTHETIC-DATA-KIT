Athymis Gestion launches a fund dedicated to generation Y


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; }a:link { } Athymis Gestion, the asset management firm led by Stéphane Toullieux, has launched the fund Athymis Millennial, which invests in the theme of Generation Y or the Millenials. This young population, born between 1980 and 2000 “brings a dynamic social effect which the business world cannot ignore,” the asset management firm says. This new generation will represent half of the active French population by 2020. The Athymis Millennial fund thus integrates the generation Y problematic and selects businesses which are the best adapted to this “new millenium,” in the words of Athymis Gestion. “Listening to the specific issues of the Millenials, innovation and especially integration of the digital revolution, customer-oriented approach, new methods of management, social engagements are several of the selection criteria for this portfolio, in which adaptation to change and not search for income is privileged,” says the asset management firm. The new fund, launched at the initiative of Stéphane Toullieux, is managed by Hicham El Aissaoui and Sébastien Peltier, two generation Y managers, Athymis Gestion says.
