Syz group launches private equity activities


The family-owned Swiss financial group Syz on 10 December announced the launch of Syz Capital, an activity specialised in investment advising for private markets. This unit becomes the fourth division of the group, joining high-end private banking, management of institutional assets, and services to independent managers. Syz Capital will select investment opportunities in private markets, and will offer custom solutions via themed funds and co-investment instruments, as well as advising services for financing and capital structuring. The unit will be based in Zurich, and will be directed jointly by Marc Syz (son of Eric Syz, founder of the Syz group) and Olivier Maurice, who had previously worked at Ace & Company. Syz becomes group CEO, while Maurice will be head of commercial development and a member of the executive and investment boards at the group. “Syz Capital is aiming to offer unique access to targeted opportunities in private markets and direct investment. The company is seeking to align the interests of all parties, by actively participating in each operation it undertakes,” Marc Syz, managing partner at Syz, says in a statement. The product range is based on two core offerings. The first is a diversified multi-manager fund, with no constraints. Clients may also access mandates for personalised portfolios in sub-segments of private markets. The second offering is direct investments in family businesses, aimed at family office clients in particular. “Syz Capital is taking the latest step in the evolution of the Syz Group … With Syz Capital, our objective is to democratise private equity investment. Our clients are composed primarily of entrepreneurs, who understand the real economic impact which investment in private companies can have; that means sharing a vision, and profiting from the growth created by a well-performing business model,” says Syz
