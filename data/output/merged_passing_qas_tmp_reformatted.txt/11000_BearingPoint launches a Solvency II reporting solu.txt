BearingPoint launches a Solvency II reporting solution


The consulting firm BearingPoint has announced the launch of Abacus/Solvency II, a specialised reporting solution for European insurers, which allowed them to collect, consolidate, validate and send their reports under Solvency II regulations in a “simple, effective and cost-efficient way.” Abacus/Solvency II is based on the IT platform of the bank reporting solution Abacus/DaVinci, which is used in Europe by many banking and financial establishments. The system makes it possible to produce all quantitative reports in the structures defined by the regulator (Quantitative Reporting Templates, or QRTs), which are currently established by the European Indurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), and to update thee reports to take into account future regulatory changes and new requirements in this area. “BearingPoint’s objective is to establish ABACUS/Solvency II as a standard regulatory reporting solution for the insurance sector,” Jean-Christophe Gaury, head of France for the Insurance sector at BearingPoint, explains. The agency is essentially making an easy-to-use, accessible and multilingual interface at the disposal of the widest possible number of users in Europe.
