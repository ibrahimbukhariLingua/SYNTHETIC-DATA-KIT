Absolute Return Partners launches an energy fund


In response to growing demand on the part of investors for uncorrelated and liquid alternative management products, Absolute Return Partners (ARP) will launch an energy fund entitled NEAS Power Fund on 1 October. The fund will trade futures, forwards and options on carbon emissions certificates and complex energy commodities (carbon, gas, and petrol). More than 95% of the shares traded will be listed on the two main Europeanenergy trading markets, Nordpool and EEX. NE Capital Management, an affiliate of the Danish energy specialist firm Nordjysk Elhandel (NEAS), will be responsible, as sub-investment manager, for the day-to-day management of the portfolio.
