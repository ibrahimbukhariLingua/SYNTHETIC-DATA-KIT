Fidelity Germany launches a wealth portfolio solution


With SAM (for: Strategische Anlage Modellierung), Fidelity Worldwide Investments is offering German retail fund subscribers wealth management and advising. Whether it be for short-term investments, an individual savings retirement plan or to create savings for a real estate investment, SAM is designed as a complete solution. SAM portfolios are adapted to the needs of individual clients, with automated monitoring up to the time of payment, and risks systematically and progressively reduced from five years to the end of the savings period, without the client needing to pay attention to them constantly. This service is available for investments of EUR10,000 and up.After determining via a questionnaire what the clientâ€™s expectations are, the SAM system selects the three best funds in each category among the 8,000 funds on sale in Germany from 220 asset management firms, so long as they are rated at least 4 stars by Morningstar and they have an adequate track record and asset levels. In addition, SAM analyses the performance of pre-selected funds with regard to their risks of loss and volatility. That then allows for the creation of profiled portfolios (from prudent to dynamic) able to pass through difficult market phases without excessive fluctuation.
