Three potential future paths for LIA


The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), the Libyan sovereign fund, is waiting to get back most of its assets, which are frozen abroad, according to Les Echos. The teams in place at the sovereign fund say that several possible scenarios are taking shape. Either the fund will become a strategic national investor, on the model of Qatarâ€™s fund, or it will become a safeguard fund on the model of the Abu Dhabi fund Adia. The third possibility is that assets will be gradually sold off in order to finance reconstruction of the country.
