Analyst fined by AMF and barred from practise for 10 years


The sanctions committee of the French Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) has hit hard. It has handed a former analyst at CA Cheuvreux a pecuniary sanction of EUR100,000, and a bar from practicing in the profession of financial analysis for a period of ten years. He had been accused of violating the rules prohibiting transactions by analysis on financial instruments and declaration of any securities accounts open in their names, of failing in his requirement to abstain from the use of insider information, and of having diffused false information (see NewsManagers of 23 May 2017).
