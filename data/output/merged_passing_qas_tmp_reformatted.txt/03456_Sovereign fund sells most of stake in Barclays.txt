Sovereign fund sells most of stake in Barclays


La Tribune reports that the Abu Dhabi sovereign fund Ipic, representing the interests of Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, yesterday sold 11% of the 16.3% stake in the capital of Barclays which it had held. Despite having sold the shares at a price 16% below the value of the shares on Monday night, the fund’s capital gains totalled GBP1.5bn (EUR1.7bn), 42% of the proceeds of the GBP3.5bn sale. The approximately GBP5bn the fund spent in late October 2008 allowed the bank to avoid having to rely on a bailout from the government, and the arrival od Abu Dhabi in the capital of the firm reassured the markets. The exit of the investor has relaunched speculation about the banking sector in general, says the newspaper, and about the health of Barclays in particular and about the behaviour to be expected of other sovereign investors (Qatar, Singapore, China). The sale of the bank’s asset management activities (GBP6bn) shows that the company needs new money, even more so due to a weak start to second quarter. For its part, the Abu Dhabi fund now prefers to invest in energy and commodities, and, according to La Tribune, says that “sovereign funds are financial investors in search of capital gains, and not angels sent to save banks.”
