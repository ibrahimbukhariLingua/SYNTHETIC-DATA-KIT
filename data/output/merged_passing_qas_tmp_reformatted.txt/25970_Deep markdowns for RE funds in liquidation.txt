Deep markdowns for RE funds in liquidation


The Berlin-based ratings agency Scope has determined that on average, the 126 properties sold by the 11 German open-ended real estate funds in liquidated were sold 12.5% below their most recent market value since the liquidation decision was taken. The discount rises with time. It is on average 6.9% during the first year after the announcement of the liquidation, but totals 18.5% in the second year, and 22.2% in the third.Since the announcement of the decision to liquidate the fund, the 381 remaining assets have depreciated by an average of 4.5%. And Scope predicts a further 5% downward correction in market values. Since the portfolios are also quite different from one another, Scope cannot rule out further capital losses which may reach 15%.Among the portfolios to be liquidated which present the least risks, Scope has selected the KanAm grundinvest, CS Euroreal, TMW Immobilien Weltfonds and SEB Immoinvest funds.On the other hand, the riskiest portfolios are the DEGI Business, International and German Business funds as well as the Axa Immoselect.
