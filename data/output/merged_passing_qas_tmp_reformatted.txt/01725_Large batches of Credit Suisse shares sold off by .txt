Large batches of Credit Suisse shares sold off by managers


AGEFI Switzerland reports that four Credit Suisse Group managers have sold off significant numbers of shares in the bank on stock markets in the past two days. In total, 500,000 shares have been sold in four transactions, for a total of nearly CHF27.8m, according to the website SIX. Based on 2008 activities, it appears that only one person is likely to have made a single transaction, concerning 300,000 shares. He is Paul Calello, Chief Executive Officer Investment Banking at Credit Suisse. As of the end of 2008, he held 411,856 shares in CS. On the board at the firm, the CEO, Brady Dougan, held the second-largest number of Credit Suisse shares, with 296,000, after Calello, and he therefore could not have been responsible for the 300,000-share transaction, but could have been responsible for selling off one of the other three batches of shares.
