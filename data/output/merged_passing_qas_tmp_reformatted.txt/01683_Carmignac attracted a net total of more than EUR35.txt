Carmignac attracted a net total of more than EUR350m in Europe in October


Edouard Carmignac insisted at a press conference on Thursday in Madrid that redemptions from the management firm in Spain were only a storm in a teacup, Funds People reports. As of the end of September, the Spanish market represented 6% of overall assets at Carmignac Gestion. Since then, EUR450m have flowed out of its funds, one quarter of total assets under management in Spain, and about 2% of assets under management at the firm. In October, however, Carmignac Gestion drew EUR350m in net subscriptions, and in the last week of the month, it saw net inflows in Spain. Responding to critical observations that rapidly increasing assets under management could pose problems of capacity for the funds, Carmignac stated that over the past two years, he has been formatting the firm in a way that will make it able to manage EUR50bn by the end of 2012, a goal which initially surprised his own team, but which the business now looks likely to achieve.
