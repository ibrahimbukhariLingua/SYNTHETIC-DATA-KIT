BlackRock reduces stake in Man Group below 5%


As regulations require, BlackRock has announced that it has reduced its stake in the alternative management group Man Group below 5%, compared with 9.32% in March this year. The news comes at a time when Man Group has been through a difficult period for the past two years, which has resulted in its removal from global MSCI indices last month.
