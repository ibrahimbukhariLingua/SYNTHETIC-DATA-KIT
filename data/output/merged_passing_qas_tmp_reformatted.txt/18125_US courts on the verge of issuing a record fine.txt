US courts on the verge of issuing a record fine


US prosecutors accuse a hedge fund affiliate of SAC Capital, CR Intrinsic Investors, its manager, Matthew Matroma, and Dr. Sidney Gilman of pocketing record profits of USD276m between 2006 and 2008 from insider trading, Les Echos reports. The trades are said to have been conducted on the basis of tests of medications to treat Alzheimerâ€™s, which were not public at the time. The SAC Capital trader, who has since left the firm, used the information to speculate and make money on shares in Elan Corp and Wyeth LLC, with the complicity of doctor Gilman, an eminent neurologist who oversaw clinical trials of bapineuzumab, a treatment for the illness.
