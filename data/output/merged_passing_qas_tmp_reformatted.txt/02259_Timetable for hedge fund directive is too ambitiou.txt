Timetable for hedge fund directive is too ambitious


The timetable for amending the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFM) is too ambitious, according to experts quoted by Ignites Europe. The proposed date for the first reading in the European Parliament, expected to take place in February 2010, is too soon.Speaking at last week’s Asset Management Conference in London, Peter De Proft, director general at Efama, said: «We are now moving towards having a general framework for non-Ucits funds; it is so important not to rush».
