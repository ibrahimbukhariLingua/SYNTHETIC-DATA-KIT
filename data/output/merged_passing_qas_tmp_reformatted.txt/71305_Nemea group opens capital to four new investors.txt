Nemea group opens capital to four new investors


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } The residential services specialist Nemea on 6 March announced that it is making changes to its capital structure, with the entry of Arkea Capital, BNP Développement, Grand Sud-Ouest Capital and Crédit Agricole Aquitaine Expansion, which jointly control about 40% of securities. This capital increase will allow Nemea to consolidate its tourism activity (60% of its earnings), and to add to its business and student branches. With 22 Appart’Etud residences in major student areas, and seven new locations opened in 2017, Nemea has set the objective of opening seven to 12 locations per year, for 44 Appart’Etud locations by 2020. Nemea will soon move and enlarge its headquarters, but will continue to be based in Mérignac, to make space for all of the personnel necessary for growth.
