DeAWM transforms 12 db X-tracker funds into physical replication ETFs


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management (DeAWM) has announced that it will soon be converting 12 ETFs of its db X-trackers range from synthetic replication to physical replication. ETFs exposed to equity markets in the Asia-Pacific region will primarily be affected, which represent about EUR2.5bn in assets (as of 30 May 2014). In April, DeAWM launched a first wave of conversions of 18 synthetic db X-trackers ETFs to physical replication (see NewsManagers of 17/04/2014), which allowed the asset management firm to create a presence for itself as a top player in Europe in this segment.
