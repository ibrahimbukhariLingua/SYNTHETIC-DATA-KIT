Raiffeisen paid CHF560m for non-US activities of Wegelin


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Raiffeisen banking group has paid CHF560m to acquire the non-US activities of the Swiss Wegelin private bank, which have since been transferred to the new Notenstein bank, according to the Handelszeitung. This total comes from a document formulating the recommendations of the New York state prosecutorâ€™s office for criminal charges against Wegelin in the United States. The transaction was announced in January 2012, shortly before Wegelin was accused of helping US taxpayers to conceal their assets from the tax authorities. The sale price has not then been revealed. With these figures, the prosecutor intends to demonstrate that Wegelin is able to quickly pay the sum in question (USD75m) to settle charges against it.
