Pioneer launches a Luxembourg-based Sicav for the UK


Pioneer Investments has confirmed plans to launch in August 2012, a Luxembourg-domiciled UK registered SICAV subject to regulatory approvals. Through a UCITS IV structure, the asset manager, an affiliate of Italy’s UniCredit, will offer UK investors greater access than before to a selection of its strategies.The SICAV will allow UK investors access to the same portfolio management capabilities as clients outside of the UK."Pioneer Investments’ existing main international umbrella is a Fonds Commun de Placement (FCP). While in general terms it is a mutual fund just like a SICAV, it is not common in the UK and for retail investors an FCP has certain tax drawbacks which do not apply to the SICAV», explains a press release.The new SICAV range will be important for Brian Clay who was hired at the beginning of July as head of its UK wholesale business, his role is to develop relationships with the leading UK Distribution networks, Multi-managers and Discretionary Managers.Once the SICAV is launched, it will be notified to the FSA for retail sale in the UK and reporting status will be sought from HMRC. 19 Pioneer SICAV sub-funds: Absolute Return Bond Euro Aggregate Bond Global Aggregate Bond Strategic Income Euro High Yield Global High Yield Emerging Markets Bond Euroland Equity Top European Players U.S. Fundamental GrowthU.S. Pioneer Fund U.S. Research European Research Euro Bond Euro Corporate Bond U.S. Dollar Aggregate Bond U.S. High Yield Euro Strategic Bond Commodity Alpha
