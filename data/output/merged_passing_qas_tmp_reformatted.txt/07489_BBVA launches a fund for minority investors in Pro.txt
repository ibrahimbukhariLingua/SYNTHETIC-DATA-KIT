BBVA launches a fund for minority investors in Propriedad


Funds People reports that BBVA has launched the BBVA Ahorro II fund, whose benchmark is one-day repo rate, and which aims to achieve returns equivalent to these “repos” after fees. It will be an exclusively bond fund, and will charge fees of 0.35%. The low risk profile product is aimed at the last 342 minority shareholders in the BBVA Propriedad fund, who control 0.21% of its assets (EUR1.42bn), whom BBVA Asset Management decided at the end of July to evict. Redemptions from the BBVA Propriedad fund were frozen at the end of 2008, but a “liquidity window” was opened in April, and 2,578 investors then exited the fund.
