Christian Bito makes a comeback with CBT Gestion


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } “After 9 months of enforced holiday,” Christian Bito, former managing partner at Rothschild & Cie Gestion, has obtained a license from the AMF for his new management firm, CBT Gestion, which he is founding with Vladimir Danesi, former head of multi-management at Rothschild & Cie Gestion, and Jean-Luc Fargin, former treasurer of the Pasteur institute, who is administrative and financial head of the new firm. Due to the particular expertise of its founders, CBT Gestion will aim to provide traditional multi-management products, with adequate liquidity and diversification, with specific solutions in the area of portfolio risk profile control. The range will be aimed at CIFs (investment advisers), in the form of funds or mandates, and at financial institutions. “Our plans will initialls concern diversified management, wealth style, and Euro zone, PEA eligible equities portfolios,” says Bito, president and CEO of the new firm. Bito, who has developed a management technique based on risk levels (volatility), explains that the formula “allows for better adaptation of products to the expectations of investors. In particular, taking into account the expectations and behaviour of the markets gives high performance results on turbulent markets which need perhaps a few more years to stabilise.”
