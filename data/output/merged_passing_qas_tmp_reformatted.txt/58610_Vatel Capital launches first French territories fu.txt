Vatel Capital launches first French territories fund


Vatel Capital, which traditionally invests in Corsica, has launched its first proximity investment fund (fonds d’investissement de proximité, FIP) to invest in French overseas territories. It is entitled Mascarin Capital n°1. «Drawing on a vast network of 30,000 small and mid-sized businesses based in the French overseas departments (départements d’outre-mer, DOM), the investment strategy of Vatel Capital will be focused particularly on sectors known well to the management team: agribusiness, tourism, renewable energy and corporate services,” a statement explains. The fund is expected to offer the same tax advantages as for Corsican funds. Vatel Capital has also indicated that two of its FCPI funds this year went into liquidation, and have commenced distributions. Eight out of the 10 FCPI funds managed by Vatel Capital currently show positive performance, excluding tax breaks.
