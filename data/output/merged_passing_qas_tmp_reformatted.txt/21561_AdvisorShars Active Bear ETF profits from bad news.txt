AdvisorShars Active Bear ETF profits from bad news


A steep fall in the value of shares in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc last month (48%) brought profits for David Einhorn, the famous hedge fund manager. It was also good news for the AdvisorShares Active Bear ETF (USD280m), managed by John DelVecchio in Dallas, and Brad Lamensdorf in Connecticut, The Wall Street Journal reports. The fund, the only one of its kind, is catalogued by Morningstar as the only actively-manged, short-only ETF in the world. In other words, the ETF makes only negative bets, but does not use leverage, and the composition of its portfolio is published on a daily basis.
