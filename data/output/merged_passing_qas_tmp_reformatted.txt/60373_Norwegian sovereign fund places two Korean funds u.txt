Norwegian sovereign fund places two Korean funds under watch


The Norwegian sovereign fund on 29 June announced that it has placed its stakes in two Korean companies on a watch. The companies, Hansae Co Ltd and Hansae Yes24 Holdinjgs Co Ltd, are suspected of violating the ethics code of the fund. “These companies are planed on watch due to an unacceptable risk that they are contributing to promoting, or are responsible for systematic violations of human rights,” the sovereign fund says in a statement.
