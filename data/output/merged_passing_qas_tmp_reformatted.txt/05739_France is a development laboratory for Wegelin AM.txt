France is a development laboratory for Wegelin AM


Wegelin Asset Management -a division of Swiss-based private Bank Wegelin- which started on the French market in January, has spent all this time since then to set the bases for its development en France. It has started to concentrate on institutional investors who are managing their own account, just like it does in Switzerland where the company has a broad client base among pension funds and insurance companies.However, to be successful on the French market, Wegelin wished to go further. In order to contact other professional investors (FoFs, private banks and so on), the asset management company recently passed a partnership with the third party marketer (TPM) Aloha Finance."This approach is adapted to the French market which is very fragmented but where private investors may have needs that are very similar to those of institutional investors. Thus, they are also very interested in our management strategies», says Pierre-Yves Cahart. If this double approach is successful in France, which is a sort or laboratory or testing ground for this kind of model, it could possibly also be used in other European countries, especially in Italy. «Provided that we find the right partners to develop our business», the head of institutional customers in France and French-speaking countries at Wegelin AM says.In the meantime, Wegelin is selling its active indexing equity strategy, managed by Daniel Leveau, the head of the quant management team. After been awarded a sales licence in July, the company started with the active sales drive of the range, which combines active and index-based, market picking strategies and consists of three Luxembourg domiciled UCITS III funds."The response of French institutional investors to this range has been very positive», the manager says. «One must say, though, that French institutional investors were themselves expressing interest for these products, which has prompted us to propose them in France», Cahart confirms.Other strategies might be proposed to French customers in the future, especially the «global diversification» one, which has no sales license in France yet. «We actually register a strong demand for product that include a pre-defined exposure to the different sources of risk», says Cahart.
