Change of strategy at 3i


The British management firm 3i has decided to open its private equity unit to outside investors, La Tribune reports. Investors from Asia, North America, Europe and the Middle East contributed one third of the capital raised for the vehicle which the firm has recently put together (putting in EUR400m out of a total of USD1.2bn), whereas 3i had previously relied exclusively on capital from its publicly traded holding company. 3i says the decision to turn to external capital was motivated by opportunities offered by the market.
