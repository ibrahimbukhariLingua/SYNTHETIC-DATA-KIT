Irish asset management continues international drive


The Irish Funds Industry Association (IFIA) will open representative offices in Shanghai, Frankfurt and Sydney, bringing the number of branch offices worldwide to ten, the professional association announced at its annual conference on 13 September.The association began its international offensive last year, with the opening of offices in the United States, in Atlanta, New York and Chicago, and in Europe and London. Since then, the IFIA has opened offices in Singapore, Tokyo and Hong Kong.According to the CEO of the association, Pat Lardner, “this all demonstrates the IFIA’s commitment to being present on all the major growth markets, in order to better promote Ireland as the ideal jurisdiction for investment funds distributed internationally. We would like to be available to assist asset managers to find the solutions, products and expertise that Ireland can offer in a constantly-changing international regulatory environment.”In other words, the asset management sector in Ireland clearly wishes to defend and strengthen its position in relation to continental European competition, and particularly in response to activism on the Luxembourg market, which has a strong presence on all major markets worldwide.
