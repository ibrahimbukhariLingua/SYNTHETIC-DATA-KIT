Corporate default rates may rise again in 2012


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The ratings agency Standard & Poorâ€™s estimates that default rates in Europe for speculative category corporate bond issues may fall slightly in 2011, and then rise again in 2012, due to a difficult market environment and refinancing problems. Default rates totalled 5.9% as of the end of September, compared with a peak of 14.8% at the end of third quarter 2009. This rate will fall to about 4% by the end of the year, and 3.8% by the end of 2011. However, restrictive monetary policy and rising refinancing risks may lead to a rise in default rates, particularly for LBOs launched between 2006 and 2008, at 6.5% or higher in 2012.
