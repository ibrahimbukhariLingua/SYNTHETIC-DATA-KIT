ETP returns not to be expected


Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank, Julius Baer, UBS and Amundi launched 45 commodity ETPs in the first two months of 2010, according to figures from Deutsche Bank, compared with 66 such launches across Europe in the whole of 2009. The launches come after assets under management in European commodity ETPs surged 145 per cent to EUR21.2bn in 2009, according to Deutsche. However, investors in these products are, more often than not, receiving substantially worse returns than those of the underlying spot commodity prices.
