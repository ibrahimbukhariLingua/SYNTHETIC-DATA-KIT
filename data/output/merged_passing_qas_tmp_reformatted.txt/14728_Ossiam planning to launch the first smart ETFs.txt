Ossiam planning to launch the first smart ETFs


According to information obtained by Newsmanagers, Ossiam, the ETF development firm led by Bruno Poulin and Antoine Moreau (see Newsmanagers of 26 October 2010), with Natixis Global Asset Management as its majority shareholder, are planning to launch five new products in the month of June. It will be a European launch, as license applications have been submitted to several European regulators (Italy, Germany, and the UK).The ETFs in question are part of what could be called a niche strategy. The Ossiam products will belong to the “smart” family of ETFs, as opposed to traditional ETFs. According to our sources, this may mean equities ETFs offering alternatives to indices weighted according to market capitalisation, and which may be instead weighted according to other factors, such as volatility. The indices on which the house products will be based will be created in collaboration with traditional index providers, on the basis of optimisation criteria, backtesting, etc.More has also now become clear about the organisation of the firm, particularly about the development and distribution arms of Ossiam. Natixis Global Associates International (NGAI) will handle distribution to institutional investors in Europe and Asia. Isabelle Bourcier, who has recently been appointed as director of development, will be exclusively in charge of the French market. In addition, the former head of Lyxor AM will also have a “product specialist” role, at least in the interim, for products to be distributed in Europe by NGAI. In France, two other people will soon be recruited to assist her.
