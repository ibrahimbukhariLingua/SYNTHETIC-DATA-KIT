Strong growth in annual profits for Syz &amp; Co group


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Swiss banking group SYZ & CO grew strongly in 2013, with assets under management totalling CHF28.7bn as of the end of December, for growth of 14.5% at the end of 2012, the group announced in a statement on 15 April. The observed increase of CHF3.7bn was 62% due to a net inflow of CHF2.3bn, and inflows of new money of CHF2.3bn, while the rest arises from the performance of management. Ordinary revenues increased by more than 20% to CHF220.1m, while costs increased 9%. As a result, net profits at the Group more than doubled, to a total of CHF26m (compared with CHF12.6m in 2012). The good performance management showed in 2013 and the gradual recovery of economic growth in most developed countries has made it possible to envision continued growth for the group in 2014, as the results in the first three months confirm, a statement says.
