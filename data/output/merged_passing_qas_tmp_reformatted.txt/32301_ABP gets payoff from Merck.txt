ABP gets payoff from Merck


To settle a lawsuit, the pension fund for public employees in the Netherlands ABP (EUR291bn), a few days before a hearing scheduled for 4 March before a New Jersey court, obtained an agreement from the US pharmaceuticals company Merck to pay it USD215m, or EUR161m, Fondsnieuws reports.For the past five years, ABP had accused Merck of publishing the results of clinical trials which lasted two years, and which demonstrated that the anti-cholesterol medication Cytorin delivered no statistical advantage in the treatment of arterial sclerosis compared with the generic product Cimvastatin too late. These results lost investors money.The Dutch pension fund led a class action lawsuit in which it teamed up with the Jacksonville Police and Fire Retirement System, the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit and International Fund Management.Overall, the class action lawsuit will cost Merck USD688m, or EUR517m, to settle.
