Liquidity still tops concerns for bond managers


Nearly one in two bond managers estimates that a lack of liquidity in corporate bonds represents the largest threat to the sector, according to the latest Aviva Investors survey of a sample of managers with over GBP2trn in bond assets under management. These concerns already took the fore in the second half of 2015, but have not dissipated. In addition to problems with liquidity, 15% of the sample of managers cite a stoppage of quantitative easing policy and more severe banking regulations.Two thirds of managers surveyed are expecting total returns of zero to 3% for corporate bonds, while 15% of them are expecting negative returns. The percentage is roughly the same for government bonds. Outlooks for emerging market debt are also very negative, as 50% of managers are anticipating negative returns.The largest threat to government bonds is rising interest rates, according to 37% of bond managers, while 26% cite a low level of interest rates, and 21% cite stoppage fo quantitative easing policies. In the euro zone, 63% of managers are not expecting interest rates to rise beyond 2017, but 60% see an increase in British interest rates before the end of the year. Managers are also unanimous in predicting that the United Kingdom will not leave the European Union.
