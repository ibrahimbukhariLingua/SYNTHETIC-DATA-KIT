Baring Asia Growth Fund opens to Vietnamese market


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } HyungJin Lee, head for Asian equities and manager of the Baring Asia Growth Fund, a Baring fund which invests in equities from Asian companies, has obtained permission to invest in Vietnam, he announced at a conference in Paris on Tuesday. This will extend his investment universe already including Korea, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. The manager is already allowed to invest in Australia, which is not part of the benchmark index, the MSCI AC Asia ex Japan Total, when he finds interesting companies. “The index has 600 stocks, but my investment universe is 2,000 stocks,” Lee says. The fund currently has 47 positions in the portfolio, selected for their quality, growth and ability to rebound on the market. The themes currently preferred by Lee are Asian consumption, reforms and structural growth, and technologies. In this latter area, which he prefers particularly, the head of Asian equities cites the advent of “big data.” With assets of EUR82.6m, the fund has earned annualised returns over three years of 12.5%, compared with gains of 12.7% for its benchmark index, as of the end of January. In 2014, it gained 23.6%, compared with +19.7% for the index, after a year in 2013 at -2.5%, compared with a decline of 1.1% for the index.
