Syz says German investors expect too much


In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Eric Syz, CEO of the Swiss firm of the same name, claims that German investors expect too much of private banks, but that they are stingy about paying commissions, which makes it impossible to conduct private banking activities in reasonable economic conditions. Retail clients are also difficult to serve because they are often passive and conformist.However, Syz sees opportunities to develop in the institutional client segment, especially pension funds and insurers. In terms of institutional asset management, the Swiss firm is hoping to gain market share in Germany, France and Italy.
