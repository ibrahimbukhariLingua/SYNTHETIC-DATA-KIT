State Street launches an index dedicated to private equity


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } State Street Corporate has launched the State Street Liquid Private Equity Investable Index, a new index which offers access to exposures in the private equity sector. This solution may be used as a liquid substitute for investment in private equity, and represents the first in a series of investable indices. The index was developed as part of research carried out under a partnership between State Street and State Street Associates, which suggests that private equity managers are collectively outperforming the equity markets in the task of anticipating the relative performance of the various sectors of the economy. Starting from that point, the model identifies the exposure to different private equity investments using a proprietary index, the State Street GXPrivate Equity Index (SSPEI), which includes more than 2,400 private equity funds, representing assets amounting to over USD2.2trn in engagements. The index, currently available in the United States and Australia, will soon be launched in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Switzerland, and Canada.
