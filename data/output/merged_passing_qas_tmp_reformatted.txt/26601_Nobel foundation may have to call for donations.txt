Nobel foundation may have to call for donations


The performance of the investments of the Nobel foundation fell from 8.6% per year in the 1990s to 1.1% since 2000, which appears to be due to alternative investments, which as of the end of 2012 represented about 33% of assets totalling SEK3.1bn, according to figures from Bloomberg relayed by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.Since then, the unit Nobel prize has been reduced to SEK8bn from SEK10bn, and the amount spent on the official banquet in honour of the laureates has been reduced. The Foundation is now considering seeking donations in the next few years, but a decision has not yet been taken.
