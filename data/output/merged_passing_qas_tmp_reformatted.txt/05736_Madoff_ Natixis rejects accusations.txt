Madoff: Natixis rejects accusations


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Natixis announced in a statement on 9 December that it has not yet received notification of a lawsuit from the legally-appointed trustee of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (“BMIS”), but that it nonetheless rejects the plaints against it. Following a press statement released by the trustee, Irving Picard, the bank announced that “Natixis rejects the claims against it, and is planning to take the necessary measures to defend itself and ensure that its legal rights are protected.” Natixis says that it “has always acted in good faith and that it did not gain from, nor participate in, nor have knowledge of the fraud committed by Bernard Madoff. To the contrary, it is a civil party in the current penal legal action currently in the instruction process in Paris.” The statement points out that as of 31 December 2009, Natixis had set aside EUR463m, or 100% of its exposure to Madoff assets, minus insurance costs.
