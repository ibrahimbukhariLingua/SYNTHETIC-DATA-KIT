Unigestion plans assault on Canadian market


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Unigestion is continuing its international development. The Swiss asset management firm, based in Geneva, has opened an office in Toronto, in order to conquer Canadian institutional clients, eFinancial News reports. As a part of that effort, Unigestion has recruited Heather Cooke, formerly of Mercer Global Investments Canada, whose mission will consist precisely of setting up this asset management activity for local institutional investors. The asset management firm will target pension funds and foundations as a top priority. Meanwhile, the firm is seeking to recruit a senior head in charge of distribution for its Toronto office. Unigestion is not starting out with a completely blank page in the country. In 2011, the asset management firm won its first mandate in Canada from Desjardins, a Quebec company specialised in financial services.
