Edouard Carmignac strongly critical of Santander and BBVA


The founder of Carmignac Gestion and himself a manager, Edouard Carmignac has sinled out Satander and BBVA for strong criticism, Expansión reports. He called their attitude “prehistoric,” since the two major Spanish banks recently withdrew Carmignac funds from the list of products that they offer to clients. He says the two firms are now selling their inhouse funds, even though they are less profitable for subscribers. The newspaper reports that since Quality, the third-party fund platform from BBVA, published a report a few weeks ago which suggested that Carmignac may encounter some problems due to the significant increase in its assets under management, the French asset management firm has seen EUR450m in redemptions from its EUR1.8bn in assets in Spain. Edourard Carmignac has made assurances that these redemptions have not penalized other shareholders in the funds, and the two Spanish banks have preferred to make no comment about the issue
