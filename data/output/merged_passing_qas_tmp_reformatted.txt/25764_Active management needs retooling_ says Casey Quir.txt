Active management needs retooling, says Casey Quirk


Most current active investment strategies are becoming outmoded. Investors’ requirements and frameworks are moving away from rigid benchmark-based allocations towards risk-factor and outcome-based mandates. Thus, the Casey Quirk consultancy stresses, next-generation “New Active” strategies will represent nearly 45% of industry revenue opportunity worldwide through 2018. New Active strategies will attract USD3.4trn of inflows through 2018, while legacy active portfolios will lose more than USD1.8trn. In comparison, passive strategies will attract only USD1trn during the same time frame, according to the new report Life After Benchmarks: Retooling Active Asset Management.There will be six categories of New Active strategies, all of which erase the line between traditional and alternative investments by incorporating more innovative techniques in friendlier packaging: broad debt investments, benchmark-agnostic equity, private capital strategies, trading strategies, dynamic multi-asset class solutions and real assets platform.Asset managers can employ any of three levers to retool legacy strategies: resetting risk guardrails, expanding the investment universe, and obtaining new capital market skill sets. The optimal path forward will vary according to manager credibility, current client footprint, and institutional appetite for change.
