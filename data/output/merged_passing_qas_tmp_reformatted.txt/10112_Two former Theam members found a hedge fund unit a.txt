Two former Theam members found a hedge fund unit at Scor GI


Xavier Lattaignant in November joined Scor Global Investments in Paris, the asset management firm of the French insurance group Scor, to head a new unit dedicated to alternative multi-management. In this role, he is appointed as head of alternative multi-management. In December he was joined by Frédéric Delleaux, as deputy head of alternative multi-management. The two investment professionals previously worked at the BNP Paribas group. Lattaignant is the former head of alternative investments at Harewood, which then became Theam after its merger with a team from BNP Paribas Asset Management. Delleaux had been an alternative investment manager at Harewood. The new desk at Scor GI will be dedicated to alternative multi-management. As of 30 June 2010, the asset management firm had nearly EUR13.6bn in assets under management, the group’s website states. The firm has been in operation since 2009, and handles the management of investment portfolios for all entities of the Scor group. It has also been accepting assets from third parties for some time.
