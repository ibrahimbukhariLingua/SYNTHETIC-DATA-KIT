BlackRock chief plays down ETF price war


Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has announced that the price war in the ETF sector is a myth, at a presentation of the groupâ€™s third-quarter results. Earlier in the week, the group announced the creation of a range of 10 low-cost ETFs. BlackRock states that the cost reduction will cost iShares USD35-40m in revenues, but Fink predicts that this will be offset by subscriptions. Fink has also pledged a campaign lasting several years to revitalise the iShares brand.
