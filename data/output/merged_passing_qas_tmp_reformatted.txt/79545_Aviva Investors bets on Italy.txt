Aviva Investors bets on Italy


Aviva Investors has grand ambitions in Italy. The British asset management firm opened an office in Milan last year, and has recruited Paolo Sarnon as head of wholesale for southern Europe. In an interview with Bluerating, Sarnon explans that Aviva Investors considers Italy to be “a fundamental market for the growth strategy in continental Europe.” In Italy, “we are investing a lot: we have an ambitious three-year development plan,” Sarnon says. The recent opening of an office comes as part of this move: “it will facilitate dialogue with clients, which is necessary in order to build long-term partnerships and strengthen our presence in the market,” he says. The wholesale segment, including wealth and fund of fund managers, is the primary target. “We are also closely watching institutionals (pension funds and retirement planning institutions) and financial advisers,” says Sarnon.
