Institutionals want to work with experts in the alternative universe


More than half (58%) of pension funds surveyed by Cerulli Associates say that it is important or very important that the alternative asset management firms they engage be from the altnernative universe. This can be taken as a warning to generalist asset management firms, a growing number of whom are seeking to develop in asset classes that they know less well, the Cerulli study (“European Institutional Dynamics 2015: Successful Strategies for Asset Managers”) finds.“Institutions value the management and experience of investment teams highly, but other attributes such as risk controls and risk management skills are also significant,” says Justina Deveikyte, senior analyst on Cerulli’s European institutional research team. The study finds that it is logical for pension funds to want to work with managers who are experienced in alternative asset management, especially when they know that the deal flow, for example in real assets such as infrastructure and real estate, is particularly important in the identification of good investments.The study also indicates that reqeusts from pension funds to hedge funds for more transparency are not really very costly. Comments on perfomance on a monthly basis would be adequate in most cases. A minority of pension funds, however, still seek explanations about the drivers of hedge fund performance. “ There is such a thing as too much information. Most pensions prefer regular commentary and additional updates on significant developments to indiscriminate data dumps,” says Tony Griffiths, senior analyst on Cerulli’s European institutional research team.
