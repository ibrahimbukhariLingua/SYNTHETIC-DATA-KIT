Financial sector fires a barrage against MiFID directive


In their responses to a proposed transposition of the European MiFID directive submitted to the German federal finance ministry on Friday, banking and asset management associations suggest that it should remain possible to launch open-ended real estate funds. They also claim that rules regulating products which will continue to be available to retail investors, including an increase in minimal subscription levels, are not appropriate and are discriminatory, and carry additional risks for retail investors. The associations claim that the proposed transposition significantly toughens the measures set out in the directive, and run the risk of penalising Germany as a financial centre against Luxembourg and Ireland.
