Wealth managers increasingly integrate ETFs into portfolios


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Since its launch more than 20 years ago, the global ETF market has developed considerably, and now has a total of USD2.5trn invested in a range of more than 5,000 ETF products, Asia Asset Management reports. Wealth managers are said to have played a key role in this spectacular growth of the ETF market, and have constantly increased the proportion of this relatively low-cost product in terms of management fees, into the portfolios of their clients. A survey carried out by the Fiancial Planning Association (FPA), a US organisation which aims to provide information to retail investors, has shown that 79% of advisers and wealth managers use or recommend ETFs when they work on the portfolio strucure of their clients, compared with only 40% in 2006. The survey also shows that the proportion of ETFs in portfolios managed by wealth managers is growing faster than any other asset class.
