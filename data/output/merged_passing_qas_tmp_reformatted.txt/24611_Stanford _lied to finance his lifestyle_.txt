Stanford “lied to finance his lifestyle”


Allen Stanford told “lie after lie” to investors in order to be able to use their money to finance his lavish billionaire lifestyle, as part of a Ponzi-type fraud scheme, a US prosecutor claimed in the first day of Stanford’s trial on Tuesday, the Financial Times report. Robert Scardino, Stanford’s lawyer, replied that his client was a “Texas boy” who did not lie to investors. Stanford will plead not guilty to all charges.
