Blackstone acquires a large distressed real estate portfolio


One of the real estate funds from Morgan Stanley has opted to sell Blackstone a portfolio of 16 office properties (3 million square feet), rather than pay off debts of USD820m which were set to mature next month, the Wall Street Journal reports. The properties were added to the portfolios of Morgan Stanley upon the acquisition of the Glenborough Realty Trust in 2006.Blackstone already holds about USD225m in junior debt from Glenborough, which it acquired over a year in small instalments from banks and insurers. That now allows it to take control of the properties, and not to take on the USD600m in debt.Blackstone manages USD41bn in real estate assets, and has already raised USD4.6bn for a global real estate fund, for which it is aiming for total volume of USD10bn.
