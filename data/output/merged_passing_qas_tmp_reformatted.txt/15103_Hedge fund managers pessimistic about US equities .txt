Hedge fund managers pessimistic about US equities and Treasury bonds


Hedge fund managers remain pessimistic about US equities, according to the most recent monthly survey (March) from TrimTabe/BarclayHedge. In March, 36% still predicted that the S&P 500 would fall, compared with 40% in February, while 28% were optimistic, compared with 26% previously. Sentiment about 10-year US Treasury bonds had not changed greatly, with 33% of managers pessimistic and 16% optimstic. However, managers have become highly pessimistic about the dollar, with 43% predicting a decline, compared with 31% in February. In parallel with this continuing pessimism, investors are continuing to pour money into hedge funds, which saw record inflows in February. 18% of hedge funds are expecting to increase their leverage in the short term, while 14% say that they are planning to lower it. This will come as little surprise, as managers last month estimated that Portugal would be the next victim of the European debt crisis, and Spain is their next candidate.
