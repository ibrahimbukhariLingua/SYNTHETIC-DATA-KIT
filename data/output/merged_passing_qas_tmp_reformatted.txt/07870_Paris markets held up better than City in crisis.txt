Paris markets held up better than City in crisis


In an interview with Les Echos, Gérard Mestrallet, chairman of the Paris Europlace association, whose 17th annual international financial conference begins today in Paris, claims that the City is still “very powerful and reactive,” but that the Paris market withstood the crisis better. “The good management of most French banks proves that their universal banking model softened the blow of the crisis. The permanent dialogue between French regulators and users of the market guaranteed a level of regulation which was adapted to investor protection. This resilience in a crisis context allowed Paris Europlace to form international ties with emerging financial markets with strong growth potential, such as Dubai, Qatar, and most recently Moscow. The Paris market plans to continue to improve its positioning, particularly in SMB financing and long-term savings development,” Mestrallet tells the newspaper.
