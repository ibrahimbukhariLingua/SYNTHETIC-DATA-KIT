AIFM directive: non-UCITS funds not necessarily invited to the party


The reporter for the proposed AIFM (Alternative Investment Fund Managers) directive at the European Parliament, Jean-Paul Gauzès, has confirmed, at a conference held by the EIFR (European Institute of Financial Regulation), that after a three-year period, funds from non-EU countries (often “offshore”) may be eligible for a passport to be offered for sale in the European Union. This would give less substance to the term “non-UCITS fund,” which Anglo-American managers, adapted to offshore vehicles, have been pleased to learn, Agefi reports. However, Gauzès pointed out that to make this possible, the countries in question must sign regulatory equivalence agreements with the European countries. If these agreements are not signed, the fund will not be eligible to be bought or sold there, the newspaper reports.
