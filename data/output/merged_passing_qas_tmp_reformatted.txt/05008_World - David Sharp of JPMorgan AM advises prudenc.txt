World - David Sharp of JPMorgan AM advises prudence on equities markets


In an interview with Les Echos, the global strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management, David Shairp, predicts that volatility will remain high in the next few months.â€¯?The major indexes will evolve within a narrow range: the S&P will oscillate between 750 and 950 points, and it is not out of the question that it may fall below its low point in November (752.44 points),? he predicts. The markets will not really rebound before the end of 2009, and so this is not really the time to return to equities markets.
