Smith Barney deal boosts asset management profits at Citi


The sale of Smith Barney to Morgan Stanley has generated net capital gains of USD6.7bn for Citi. Citi has also announced that earnings for its brokerage and asset management (BAM) division for second quarter totalled USD12.3bn, compared with USD2.5bn in the corresponding period of 2008, while net profits totalled USD6.8bn, compared with USD218m. As of 30 June, total assets came to USD56bn, which represents a decline of 14% from the end of December, which represents a desire on the part of Citi to reduce volumes in this activity. This amount includes about USD19bn managed at Nikko Cordial Securities, which is one of the activities up for sale. The sale of the Japanese affiliate was announced in May. Globally, Citi shows net profits in second quarter of USD4.3bn, or 49 cents per share.
