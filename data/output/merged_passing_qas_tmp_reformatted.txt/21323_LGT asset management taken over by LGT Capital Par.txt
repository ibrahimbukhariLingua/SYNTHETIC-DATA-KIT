LGT asset management taken over by LGT Capital Partners


The Liechtenstein banking group LGT on 19 June announced that its Asset Management activities would on 1 July be moving internally to LGT Capital Partners, a specialist in alternative management. Traditional and alternative wealth management had recently been in two separate entities, LGT Capital Management and LGT Capital Partners, respectively. Assets under management at the two divisions total about CHF40bn. LGT estimates in a statement that the borders between traditional management and alternative management have been breaking down over the past few years, which justifies such a decision. The redeployment will also allow the bank to optimise its product range and client advising. New new structure will also allow the firm to earn larger growth and to realise synergies, the nature of which have not been disclosed. LGT Capital Partners will continue to position itself as an alternative asset management firm, with expertise in various sectors, such as private equity and hedge funds. The CEO of LGT Capital Partners, Roberto Paganoni, will direct the new structure from 1 July. Torsten de Santos, CEO of LGT Capital Management, will be leaving the bank. He will, however, remain as a consultant to LGT and as a member of the board of directors for various fund companies.
