Regulatory official opposes creation of a single regulator


La Tribune reports that Sheila Bair, director of the United States financial institutions guarantor, the FDIC, has expressed criticisms to the Senate banking committee of plans to create a single financial regulator, which are part of draft reforms to financial regulations in the United States sought by the Obama administration. Bair says she is opposed to the direct control of banks, insurers, brokers, and other actors in the financial world, which are currently partly the responsibility of the FDIC, being handed to a single body. These powers would de facto become one of its most central powers.
