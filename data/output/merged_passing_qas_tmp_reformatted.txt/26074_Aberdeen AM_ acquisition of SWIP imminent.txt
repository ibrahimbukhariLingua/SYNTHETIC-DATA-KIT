Aberdeen AM: acquisition of SWIP imminent


Aberdeen AM will probably today sign off on the purchase of Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP) from Lloyds Banking Group, to create the first independent publicly-traded fund management firm in Europe, Agefi reports, citing the Sunday Times. The price of about GBP500m (nearly GBP600m), paid in shares, will allow Aberdeen to manage about GBP250bn in assets. Life insurance activities at Scottish Widows will continue to be housed at Lloyds.
