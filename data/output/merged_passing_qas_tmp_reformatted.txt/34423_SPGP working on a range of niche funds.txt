Two themed OPCVM funds have joined the offerings. The first of these is focused on the luxuries sector and is entitled “L’Esprit du Luxe.” This includes the full spectrum in the sector, from “premium plus” to ultra-luxury, and places the emphasis on emerging markets for luxuries produced on all continents. The second fund, Digital Explorer, is concentrated on tech stocks, including leaders of tomorrow. Other funds are in the works. “We will continue to offer niche products. In 2015, we are planning several launches, especially China and Africa themed funds,” Chaboud announced at a press conference in Paris on Thursday, 6 November.
