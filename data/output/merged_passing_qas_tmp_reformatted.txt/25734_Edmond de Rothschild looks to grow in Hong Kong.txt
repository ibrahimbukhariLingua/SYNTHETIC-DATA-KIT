The Edmond de Rothschild group would like to develop its private banking activities in Hong Kong, adding to its sales personnel, Asian Investor reports. According to Christophe de Backer, CEO of the firm, Edmond de Rothschild may recruit 10 people in the next 12 months. The group currently employs 70 people in Hong Kong, including private banking and asset management activities. The firm is also studying the possibility of setting up an office in Singapore. The group would also like to actively develop its asset management and research activities, and with this in mind, is actively seeking a partner in Asia to increase its assets under management in the region by one third. Globally, the group hopes to bring in about CHF40bn by 2016, both for private banking and asset management, of which Asia is expected to represent a significant proportion, de Backer says.
