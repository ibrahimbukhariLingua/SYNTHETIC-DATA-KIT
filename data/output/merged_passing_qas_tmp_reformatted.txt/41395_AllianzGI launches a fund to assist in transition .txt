AllianzGI launches a fund to assist in transition to low-carbon economy


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Allianz Global Investors has launched Allianz Europe Equity Climate Transition, a common investment fund (FCP) which offers mid- to long-term investment in European equities, respecting sustainable development criteria, and making it possible to assist in the transition to a low-carbon economy. The fund has been created through a transformation of the thematic fund Allianz Eureco Equity, which was oriented to the renewable energy and energy efficiency sector. The Allianz Europe Equity Climate Transition fund is at least 75% invested in securities which are eligible for PEA. Active management aims to meet two objectives: to reduce the exposure of the portfolio to carbon risks, in order to limit the impact on the value of investments, particularly through controlling the carbon footprint and using a system of targeted exclusions of high-risk practices, and to assist in the transition to a low-carbon economy, seizing opportunities to integrate the climate impact of companies as part of stock-picking. AllianzGI privileges companies with the lowest carbon emissions in their sectors (best peformer), those which show dynamism and progress in aligning with transition objectives (best effort), and those whose activities, products or services offer solutions to develop a low-carbon economy (best solution).
