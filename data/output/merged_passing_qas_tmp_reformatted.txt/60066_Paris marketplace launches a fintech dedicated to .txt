Paris marketplace launches a fintech dedicated to blockchain


The players in the Paris financial industry are mobilising as part of a blockchain initiative. BNP Paribas, Caceis, la Caisse des Dépôts, Euroclear, Euronext, S2iEM (géré par OFI AM) and Société Générale, with the support of Paris Europlace, yesterday announced the creation of the European fintech LiquidShare. The new independent startup, created from a partnership launched in June 2016 by its shareholders, will develop post-market blockchain infrastructure for the small and mid-sized enterprise (SME) segment. The young company aims to improve access to capital markets for SMEs, facilitating security and transparency of post-trade operations through blockchain technology. The solution will eventually help to reduce transaction costs.LiquidShare, soon to be enshrined in a Paris incubator whose name has not been disclosed, will rely on a number of individuals to achieve its project. The firm is led by Thibaud de Maintenant as CEO. Anthony Attia, a member of the board at Euronext, has been appointed as chairman of the board of directors at LiquidShare.
