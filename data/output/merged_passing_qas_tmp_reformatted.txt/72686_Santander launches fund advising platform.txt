p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } The Spanish banking group Santander has launched Santander Orienta, a new digital fund advising platform aimed at clients of its retail bank, the website Cinco Dias reports. The objective is to assist clients of the bank who wish to buy and invest in mutual funds. The tool will assist clients in their investment decisions, by giving them access to an adequate range of products appropriate to their needs and expectations. The funds will be offered for the appropriate risk and investment profile for each client, based on a profile including information about age, investment objectives, investment horizon and the level of risk they are prepared to take on. The Spanish bank will mostly offer its own funds through this tool. However, Santander Private Banking, the private banking division of the group, may offer funds from other asset management firms. In total, the platform will offer more than 180 national and international portfolios from over 350 managers, mostly to high net worth clients.
