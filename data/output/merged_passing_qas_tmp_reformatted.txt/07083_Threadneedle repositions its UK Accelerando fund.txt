Threadneedle repositions its UK Accelerando fund


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In a letter to subscribers, Threadneedle has announced that it has been granted permission by the FSA to propose to an extraordinary general shareholders’ meeting which will be held on 20 October at the Menzies Hotel Swindon, at 1:30 pm local time, that the management firm be authorised to use serivatives and futures transactions for its UK Accelerando fund, which will not alter the fund’s performance objective or investment policy, while better allowing it to hedge risks for a portfolio which will remain concentrated and focused on British equities. According to information obtained by Newsmanagers, the letter includes not only a request for permission to change the name to UK Extended Alpha Fund, but also a request for permission to end the limited issue status for the shares. Threadneedle’s proposals require a majority of at least 75% of votes cast.
