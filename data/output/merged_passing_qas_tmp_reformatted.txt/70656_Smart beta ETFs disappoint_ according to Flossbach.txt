Smart beta ETFs disappoint, according to Flossbach von Storch


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } Not as smart as they seem: smart beta ETFs are not meeting up to the expecations of investors. Most of the existing products are earning returns which are not higher, but loer, than their benchmark indices, according to a study undertaken by the German asset management firm Flossbach von Storch (“Smart Beta ETFs - Euphemismus par excellence,” Agniszka Gehringer and Kai Lehmann). Out of 160 smart beta ETFs reviewed in the study, 63% did less well than their benchmarks, the study finds. The average smart beta ETF has performance 0.5% lower than the benchmark. Last but not least, the returns from more than three quarters of smart beta ETFs is lower than the tracking index established by ETF designers. Smart beta ETFs have still earned average returns of 10.8% in 2017, but in a context of gains last year, this is not surprising, the authors say. Rather than investing in costly smart beta variants, investors would do well to invest in traditional ETFs, which cost less and do better, the authors of the study say.
