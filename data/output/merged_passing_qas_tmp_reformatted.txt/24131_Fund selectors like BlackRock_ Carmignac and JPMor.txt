Fund selectors like BlackRock, Carmignac and JPMorgan


In 2011, for the first time, brand has become a decisive element for fund selectors in Europe, who represent EUR2trn in assets. The Berlin-based publication Fund Buyer Focus (FBF) has published its pan-European Fund Brand 30 rankings (see attached document), which surveys the preferences of these intermediaries. BlackRock and Carmignac Gestion have both gained one place in the rankings compared with last year, taking first and second place, dethroning JPMorgan.FBF estimates that the size of BlackRock was the determining element, while Carmignac benefited from a rise in business from intermediaries and demand from final investors. BNP Paribas and Amundi lost 18 and 16 ranks respectively.More generally, the authors of the study estimate that in the next few years, cost efficiency will be an increasingly important factor. Fund selectors are also attaching growing important to knowledge of local markets and to ability to respond to developments in these marktets, which would work to the advantage of asset management boutiques.
