Marc Romano leaves Schroders NewFinance Capital


Marc Romano has left Schroders NewFinance Capital (SNFC), Schroders’ funds of hedge funds unit, for personal reasons. He had been chief executive officer since January 2010. Schroders has confirmed the appointment of Miles O’Connor as CEO of Schroders NewFinance Capital (SNFC). He has joined the board at SNFC and will retain his existing role as head of UK Institutional. Five years after Schroders’ acquisition of SNFC, Marc Hotimsky has also decided to step back from day-to-day management and will be retiring as executive chairman and chief investment officer during the autumn. However, he will become non-executive chairman and continue as a member of the investment committee so our clients will continue to benefit from his wealth of experience. David Mooney, currently co-head of investment, has been appointed chief investment officer for all of SNFC’s investment strategies and Benjamin Moute, has become sole head of investment. Both will join the board of SNFC reporting to Miles O’Connor. In addition Nico Marais, head of multi asset investment and portfolio solutions, will join the board.
