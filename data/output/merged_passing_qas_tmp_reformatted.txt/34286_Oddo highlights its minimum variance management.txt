Oddo highlights its minimum variance management


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Oddo Asset Management is throwing the spotlight on its minimum variance approach. In order to stimulate sales of the main fund using this approach, the asset management firm has recently renamed the fund, previously known as Oddo Min Variance Europe, as Oddo Vision, since the old title is “a name which may suggest that we value the fund with a quantitative approach, which is not the case,” explains Laurent Denize, co-CIO for investment management at Oddo AM. The fund, launched slightly over one year ago, now has EUR116m, is invested 100% in European equities, and aims to partially reduce market volatility with a minimum variance approach. Selection of 50 shares is performed according to security risk, using three filters: financial criteria, sectoral diversification of the portfolio to correct the defensive bias of the minimum variance approach, and lastly, a qualitative review of shares by the team of analyst-managers at Oddo AM. Oddo AM plans to capitalise on the minimum variance sector. Currently, the team led by Denize is doing backtesting to develop a global minimum variance fund, which would invest in US and Japanese stocks in particular.
