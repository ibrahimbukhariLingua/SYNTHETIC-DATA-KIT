A new instrument is expected to allow investors to refine their allocations in order to meet their needs and objectives. “In so far as their allocation to private assets is increasing, a growing number of institutional investors are diversifying their portfolios so as to include not only private equity but also infrastructure, private debt, natural resources, forest land, agricultural land and other ‘real assets,'” Unigestion observes in a statement. “However, many are still having difficulty determining the contribution these assets make to risk, performance, correlation and other characteristics of their portfolios.” On the basis of academic research the Private Asset Allocator tool is designed to allow institutional investors to better define their allocation according to defined objectives (a need to dynamise returns, to achieve early dividends, decorrelation from publicly-traded assets, protection against inflation, adherence with regulatory capital requirements, etc.), while also benefiting from the characteristics propert to this universe of private assets. “This new tool allows investors to set objectives for investment in private assets and to rank their importance,” the Geneva-based asset management firm emphasises. “It then formulates an allocation recommendation for the various types of private assets in line with the objectives assigned, and calculates key data for the proposed portfolio.”
