p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The alternative asset management firm Man GLG on 7 April announced the launch of the Man GLG European Mid-Cap Equity Alternative Fund, a UCITS fund dedicated to European midcaps. The new strategy, domiciled in Ireland and managed by GLG Partners, is managed by Moni Sternback, who joined Man GLG in January 2015 from Cheyne Capital. The fund aims to generate “attractive risk-adjusted returns for investors,” according to a statement, by making long and short investments in European stocks whose capitalization varies from EUR500m to EUR10bn. Moni Sternback, a manager specialised in midcaps, joined GLG after working for nearly three years on the European Mid Cap Long/Short strategies at Cheyne Capital. Before that, he was responsible for European small caps at Gartmore Investment Management, where he served from 2002 to 2011.
