New CEO at Skagen looks to international


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } In January 2015, Leif Ola Rød will become CEO of the Norwegian asset management firm Skagen, succeeding Harald Espedal. «My main task will be to maintain and further develop Skagen’s position as an independent-minded and contrarian fund manager in the Nordic region. (...) But I also have a long-term ambition to increase our international footprint even further,» he says in a statement. Rød joined Skagen in 2012, after serving as CEO of Odin, another Norwegian asset management firm. He had previously been head of support and compliance. His arrival at the helm at Skagen will coincide with a split of the roles of CEO and chief investment officer. This position will be held by Dane Ole Søeberg.
