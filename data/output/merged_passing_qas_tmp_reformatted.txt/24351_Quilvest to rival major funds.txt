Quilvest to rival major funds


Quilvest, created to manage the wealth of the Bemberg family, is planning to double its size in the next five years to EUR8bn, Les Echos reports. The CEO of Quilvest, Michel Abouchalache, says that “a major rationalisation of the French market is to be expected, as after the years of crisis, the market is still overpopulated. At least 50% of investors in funds will disappear in the next few years.”
