p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } According to the Mythos Family Offices 2010 survey, undertaken by J.P. Morgan Asset Management and others, of 64 family offices, most of them in Switzerland and Germany, 40.6% of these structures have assets of EUR300m and EUR1bn, while 23.4% manage between EUR1bn and EUR3bn, and 9.4% manage over EUR3bn, the BÃ¶rsen-Zeitung reports. As about 15% of assets are in liquid form (compared with 4% for the endowments of US universities), family offices have survived the turbulence on the financial markets without having to sell assets at a markdown in order to procure the necessary liquidity. The study finds that 23% of assets were allocated to bonds (13% for US university endowments), 26% to equities, 8% to private equity and 7% to hedge funds. Exposure to real assets such as real estate and commodities, or exotic investments such as art total 21%. The main objective of 78% of the family offices is preservation of capital, while 53% atim to avoid excessive concentrations of investment, and 40% follow the preferences of the families. Expectations in terms of performance are moderate, with an objective of 5-10% for the next five years. In the next few months, family offices are planning to reduce their allocation to cash in order to increase their exposure to emerging markets and alternative assets.
