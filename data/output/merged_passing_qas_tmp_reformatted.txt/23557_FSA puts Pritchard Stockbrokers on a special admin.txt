FSA puts Pritchard Stockbrokers on a special administrative regime


The British Financial Services Authority (FSA) announced on 9 March that it has placed the brokerage firm Pritchard Stockbrokers on a special administrative regime. The decision follows a freeze of Pritchard’s assets on 10 February this year, when the FSA observed unorthodox use of client assets, to cover the firm’s costs. ON 29 February, another brokerage firm, WH Ireland, announced that it had taken charge of the assets of most of Pritchard’s clients. The FSA says in a statement that it has named three trustees from the auditing firm Mazars who will review client positions and restore as much as possible to each client.
