Old Mutual GI to absorb research costs under MiFID II


Ahead of the entry into force of the European MiFID II directive, the British asset management firm Old Mutual Global Investors (Old Mutual GI) has confirmed a decision to cover external research costs from 3 January 2018. “External research remains of the utmost importance to our business, in order to allow fund managers to deliver good investment outcomes,” explains Warren Tonkinson, managing director at Old Mutual GI, in a statement. “However, we do not believe it is in the best interests of our customers to charge them separately for this research.”
