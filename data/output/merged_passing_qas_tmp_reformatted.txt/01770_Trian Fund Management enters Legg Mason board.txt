Trian Fund Management enters Legg Mason board


Via its “constructivist” hedge fund Trian Fund Management, activist shareholder Nelson Peltz has acquired a 4.3% stake in Legg Mason (USD700bn in assets), and has obtained a seat on the board, the Wall Street Journal reports. It has been agreed that Trian will increase its stake to 9.9% in two years, and that in the meanwhile it will vote in favour of a list of candidates for directorial positions presented by the firm’s executives. Trian bought most of its 6.94 million shares early in the summer, when they cost about USD20 each. On Friday, Legg Mason shares closed at USD31.90. The share price has tripled since its low point in March.
