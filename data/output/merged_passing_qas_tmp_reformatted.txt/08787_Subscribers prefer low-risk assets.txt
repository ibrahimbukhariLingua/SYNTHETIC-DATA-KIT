Subscribers prefer low-risk assets


As of the end of 2009, assets in Spanish funds were 75% invested in money market funds, short-term bond funds and guaranteed funds invested primarily in equities or bonds, compared with 66.6% at the end of 2006, and 80% at the end of 2008, Cinco Días reports. The historical average (76% over the past 19 years) reveals that Spanish investors have always been highly conservative, except in 2000, during the internet investment bubble, when the proportion fell to 56%. In the three years of 2007, 2008 and 2009, net redemptions totalled EUR89.47bn, which represents 97.5% of declines in assets under management, which fell by 31%, while commission revenues fell by 48%. Seven of the largest management firms had more than 80% of their assets in lower-risk investments, excepting Ibercaja, for which the figure was 57%. However, Gesmadrid and Ahorro Corporación had more than 87% of their assets in money market instruments, short-term bonds and guaranteed products.
