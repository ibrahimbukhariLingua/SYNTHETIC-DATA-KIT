Tikehau Capital sells a stake in Asten Santé


Tikehau Capital on 4 May announced plans to sell its stake in Asten Santé, a health group specialised in respiratory insufficiency, drips, nutrition, insulin therapy, housekeeping and telemedicine. The investment company and other shareholders in Asten Santé have entered exclusive talks with the La Poste group to purchase a majority stake in Asten Santé. Tikehau Capital invested about EUR28.5m in Asten Santé in April 2014 and in April 2016 (via Salvepar) invested alongside the private equity firm Gemmes Genture and other pioneering associations in assisting chronic illnesses. To date, Tikehau Capital controls 21%. “In light of the sale of its stake and the concomitant termination of various agreements tying the group to other shareholders, this sale will allow Tikehau Capital to earn capital gains of about EUR16m, before taxes and transaction costs,” the firm says in a statement. The Asten Santé group, founded in 2013, makes earnings of EUR100m, and has 750 employees.
