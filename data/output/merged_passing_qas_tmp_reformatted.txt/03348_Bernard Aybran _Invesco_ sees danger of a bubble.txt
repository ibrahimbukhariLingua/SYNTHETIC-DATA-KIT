Bernard Aybran (Invesco) sees danger of a bubble


«There is a major risk that a bubble could develop if you consider that US institutional investors were seated on a record USD2,555bn in money market funds on May 4th, 2009", says Bernard Aybran, head of multimanagement at Invesco in Paris. This actually means that institutional investors, and not only in the US, have lots of cash which just doesn’t perform at all, that produces no yield. This huge amount of liquidity will have to be invested somewhere, just to pay for the pensions, for instance. Therefore, there is a risk that big amounts of cash could be invested at the same time in one asset class that would have become fashionable, which could end into a bubble.
