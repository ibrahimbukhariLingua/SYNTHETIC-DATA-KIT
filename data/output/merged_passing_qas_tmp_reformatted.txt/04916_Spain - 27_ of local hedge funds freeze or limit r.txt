Spain - 27% of local hedge funds freeze or limit redemptions


Of the 70 hedge funds formerly registered in Spain, there are only 57 left, of which six have toughened redemption conditions, and four have seen net outflows of more than 20% of their assets, Cinco DÃ­as reports. Funds which have set up obstacles to redemptions include Cygnus Utilities, which has instituted a longer waiting period, CAAM Multistrategia Alternativa, which has limited the amount of redemptions, Accurate Global Assets, which is paying out only a part of the redemption requested if the amount is large, and Foncaixa Privada Estrategia Hedge, which is paying out only partial redemptions.
