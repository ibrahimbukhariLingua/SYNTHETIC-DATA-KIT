Stanford found guilty of fraud


R. Allen Stanford was on Tuesday found guilty of orchestrating a Ponzi plan worth USD7.1bn, the Wall Street Journal reports. At the conclusion of a criminal trial that lasted nearly three years, a jury of eight men and four women found the defendant guilty of 13 counts out of 14 against him, for fraud, conspiracy, money laundering and obstructing law enforcement. He faces a sentence of up to 230 years in prison. Stanfordâ€™s lawyers have told journalists that they will appeal the verdict.
