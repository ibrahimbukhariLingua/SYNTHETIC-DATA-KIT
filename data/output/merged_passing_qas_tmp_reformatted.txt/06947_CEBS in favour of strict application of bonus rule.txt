CEBS in favour of strict application of bonus rules


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) on 8 October published its recommendations for the application of European rules limiting bonuses for bankers, proposing a stricter interpretation of the rules than had been expected by the City. The 84-page document, which is open for consultation until 8 November, introduces much tighter limits than the G20 rules. Regulators are planning to require that the amount of bonuses be “proportional” to fixed salaries, that they be paid over a staggered three-year period, and that the paid portion of bonuses not exceed 50% of total payments, ad 30% of initial payments. The CEBS also says that the period of time over which bonus payments is to be staggered should be “further extended by management” at banks, and suggests a period of at least five years. The Committee also provides concrete examples of good governance, in which the initial cash payments are limited to 18% or 20%. Another suggestion of the Committee, undoubtedly the most controversial, is that all affiliates of European banking establishments, including those located outside the continent, should be subject to the rules. A public hearing on the matter, scheduled for 29 October in London, will likely be heated.
