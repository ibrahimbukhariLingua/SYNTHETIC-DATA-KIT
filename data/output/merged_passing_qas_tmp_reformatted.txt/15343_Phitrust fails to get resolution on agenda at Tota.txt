Phitrust fails to get resolution on agenda at Total general shareholders’ meeting


Phitrust Active Investors has not succeeded in its campaign to present the first shareholder resolution to deal with environmental issues in France, which would have gone to a vote at the Total general shareholders’ meeting on 13 May 2011.On Friday last week, the asset management firm specialised in shareholder engagement announced that it had succeeded in uniting 0.68% of capital in Total, or 16.1 million shares, behind its cause. It claims that would have allowed it to propose a resolution to modify article 14 of the firm’s statutes, to obtain increased disclosure to environmental and social risks related to its operation of oil shale mines.But at the last moment, a shareholder withdrew its support for Phitrust, which then wound up with less than 0.5% of capital, the minimum to propose a resolution, behind it.
