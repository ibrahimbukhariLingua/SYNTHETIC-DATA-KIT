Ambitious goals for Mirabaud private banking in Spain


Lionel Aeschlimann, a partner at Mirabaud and head of the asset management operation, has told Funds People that the Swiss firm is continuing to add to its private banking team in Spain. The objective is to reach total assets in this area of EUR1bn to EUR1.5bn in three years. However, recruitments will not be made at the expense of profitability.
