RWC preparing a long/short fund that complies with UCITS III


Independent asset management firm RWC Partners (USD2.3bn in assets) announced on Wednesday that it is planning to launch the Luxembourg-registered fund RWC US Absolute Alpha in October. It is a long/short product that complies with the UCITS III directive, and will be managed in London by Mike Corcell, who has joined RWC recently after managing the American Crescendo funds at Threadneedle. The new fund, which is awaiting a license from the CSSF, will be focused on US equities, with the objective of generating high returns with low correlation to the direction of the markets, and of managing the risk of a decline in all market configurations.RWC Partners is planning to release the fund, with daily liquidity, throughout Europe. The fund will have tax-optimised share classes for German and British investors, and will offer share classes which are completely hedged for currency risks in Euros, US dollars, pounds Sterling and Swiss francs.
