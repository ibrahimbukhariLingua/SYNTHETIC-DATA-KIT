Janus Henderson launched an equity fund based on biotechnologies


Janus Henderson Investors has launched an equity fund based on the theme of biotechnologies, entitled Janus Henderson Horizon Biotechnology. The Sicav, domiciled in Luxembourg, will invest at least 80% of its assets in innovative companies active in the biotech sector, or companies with activities related to this sector. Biotechs which address unsatisfied medical needs worldwide will be priority targets of the investment vehicle. The Janus Henderson Horizon Biotechnology fund will be co-managed by Andy Acker and Dan Lyons, who have a combined total of over 40 years of experience in biotech investment. They will be supported by the health care specialist investment team at Janus Henderson. Acker explains that “the pace of progress is picking up in the biotech industry, which means that medical advances are coming much more quickly.” He adds that the Food and Drug Administration, the government body which authorizes sales of medications in the United States, has approved 55 new treatments this year, an all-time record, according to the manager. Janus Henderson had about EUR325.5bn in assets under management as of 30 September 2018.
