SEC files charges in first CDS insider trading case


La Tribune reports that the US regulator has brought its first case of insider trading on credit derivative markets to court. The facts date back to 2006. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accuses a manager at Millennium Partners, an arbitrage fund, and a vendor at Deutsche Bank Securities, of profiting from insider information about a bond issue from VNU holding, which influenced an increase in the price of CDS contracts to protect against the risk of defaults by VNU.
