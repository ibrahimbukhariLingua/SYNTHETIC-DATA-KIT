Swiss stock exchange warns Credit Suisse


SIX Exchange Regulation has issued a warning to Credit Suisse Group SA for violating its disclosure requirements in relation to transactions by management. The violation was in connection with a management transaction involving 1,400 nominative shares that the firm declared and published with a delay of 18 trading days. According to SIX Exchange Regulation, at the time when Credit Suisse Group SA submitted a declaration of the operation, the transaction had already been executed by an internal department.

The infraction has been qualified as minor; therefore, SIX Exchange Regulation has opted to issue Credit Suisse SA with a warning.
