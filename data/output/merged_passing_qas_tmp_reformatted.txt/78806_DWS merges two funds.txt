DWS merges two funds


DWS Investment will be merging two funds on 9 April, NewsManagers has learnt. The DWS Invest New Resources, which invests in stocks in the commodity, energy and service sectors, will be absorbed into the DWS Invest Climate Tech, a diversified investment strategy focused on environmental protection. In a letter to investors seen by NewsManagers, DWS explains that “since mid-2008, the active allocation of the DWS New Resources fund has decreased from €500m to €46.8m (€43.9m as of 28 February 2019), due to ongoing divestment of capital.” “Sales analysis shows that investors are no longer interested in the investment strategy of the absorbed fund, as shown by the lack of net inflows in the past 24 months,” the German asset management firm continues, adding that climate tech is “a major strategic theme for the coming decades in the view of DWS.” The DWS Invest Climate Tech fund had €6.43bn in assets as of the end of February 2019. As of 31 March 2018, DWS had €676bn in assets under management.
