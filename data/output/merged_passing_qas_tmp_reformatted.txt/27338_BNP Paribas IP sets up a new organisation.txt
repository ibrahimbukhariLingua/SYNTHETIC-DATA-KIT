BNP Paribas IP sets up a new organisation


According to information obtained by Newsmanagers, the head of BNP Paribas Investment Partners, Philippe Marchessaux, on the evening before the weekend internally announced the global organisation of the asset management firm. It is a new organisation into business lines, which could be focused around two areas of activity, institutional and retail. This new configuration is intended to signify the end of the multi-boutique model at the Investment Partners unit, which is considered too costly and which has also already been modified, as with the sale of Fauchier Partners at the end of 2012 to Legg Mason, and the internalisation of activities at Fundwuest. The details of the new architecture may be unveiled in the next few days. The CEO of BNP Paribas, Jean-Laurent Bonnaf√©, at the end of July announced at a presentation of quarterly results that asset management, which accounted for EUR375bn in assets as of the end of June 2013, represents a strategic area for the group, with three priority areas for development, institutional clients, retail clients, and private banking, and emerging markets.
