Fitch updates criteria and ratings scale for AMCs


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Fitch Ratings on 22 April published an update to its criteria and ratings scale for asset management firms.Among the modifications made by the agency are a new five-point descriptive sale, new ratings definitions which explicitly label managers according to the standards practised by institutional investors, with more explicit ratings attributes for each of 30 ratings factors, and an introduction of ratings outlooks, which indicate the direction that a rating may take over a two-year period.The ratings resulting from these modifications will be communicated separately at a later date, Fitch Ratings says, but it does not expect major changes for the 55 asset management firms it rates.
