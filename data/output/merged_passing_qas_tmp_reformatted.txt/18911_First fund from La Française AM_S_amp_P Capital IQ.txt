First fund from La Française AM/S&amp;P Capital IQ partnership released


Since 1 October, Jean-Luc Hivert has been managing the LFP R2P Global Credit fund, a product created on 17 September, under a partnership signed in June with S&P Capital IQ (see Newsmanagers of 22 June). It is the first sub-fund of the SICAV LFP S&P Capital IQ Fund, domiciled in Luxembourg.The UCITS IV-compliant fund, with 150/200 positions, invests in global bond markets, and already has about USD70m in assets. It is based on the risk-to-price (R2P) strategy developed by S&P Capital IQ, which aims to outperform the Barclays Global Aggregate Corporate Hedge $ or € indices with exposure to securities from the major geographical regions (at least 90% investment grade), with systematic hedging for currency risks.The originality of the R2P methodology is that it provides ratings based on a market risk numerator (spread divided by the volatility of bond prices) and a credit risk denominator (probability of default).La Française, which has EUR5.4bn in assets in open-ended bond funds, selects securities on the basis of analysis by S&P Capital IQ from a liquid universe of 3,000 “eligible” securities, in the top two quartiles for each sector and geographical region. The French asset management firm is responsible for the construction of the portfolio and the execution of transactions.CharacteristicsName: LFP R2P Global CreditISIN code: LU08115675656 (I share class)Initial subscription: EUR0.5mFront-end fee: Maximum 3%Ongoing fees: 0.85%
