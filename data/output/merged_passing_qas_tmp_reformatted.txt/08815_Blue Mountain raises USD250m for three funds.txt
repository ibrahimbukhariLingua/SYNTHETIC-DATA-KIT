Blue Mountain raises USD250m for three funds


Hedge Week reports that Blue Mountain has raised more than USD250m for three new funds, whose objective will be to seize investment opportunities in the post-crisis credit world. The three funds are the BlueMountain Long/Short, BlueMountain Distressed Fund, and a fund dedicated to securitisations. Blue Mountain is also planning to launch a multi-client ABS fund by the end of third quarter. The funds will allow clients access to strategies which have already been proven by the firmâ€™s flagship fund, the BlueMountain Credit Alternatives, but in dedicated products with custom liquidity conditions.
