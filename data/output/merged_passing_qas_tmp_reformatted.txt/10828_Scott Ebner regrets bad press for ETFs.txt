Scott Ebner regrets bad press for ETFs


Scott Ebner, global head of development for SPDR ETFs at State Street Global Advisors, is seeking to bring calm to a tense topic. Though there has recently been a lot of talk about the risks represented by ETFs, and about the fact that the major providers use either synthetic replication of indices, or pure replication, in an environment in which these firms have had to defend one model at the expense of the other. For his part, Ebner argues that there is too much media hype on the subject.Interviewed by Newsmanagers at an event in Paris, the head also claimed that “ETFs are UCITS products, and are therefore perfectly regulated and transparent. The technique of securities lending and borrowing deployed by SPDR ETF means additional revenues, which are divided 50/50 between the client and the lending agent for the ETF funds», Ebner adds. This is also a trade which we have been doing for some of the ETFs in our range for more than ten years, knowing that it is subjec to strict risk controlling, with collateral deposited in a loan with a guarantee from a bank. Pure replication had previously constituted the maker’s mark for SPDR ETF’s house products. “However,” adds Ebner, “we did not develop synthetic replication ETFs because we never felt the need. That doesn’t mean we’re definitively closing the door on this type of construction, since we can envision it in cases where physical replication is not possible.” Though Ebner calls for more calm, he also regrets the fallout from the controversy, which has caused investors to be concerned. “It is important for us that investors retain the idea of a simple product. That’s why we now need to increase pedagogy by ETF distributors about the product.”
