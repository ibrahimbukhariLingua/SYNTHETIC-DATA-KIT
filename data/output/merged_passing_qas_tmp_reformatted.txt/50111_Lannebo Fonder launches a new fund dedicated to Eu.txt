p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Scandinavian asset management firm Lannebo Fonder on 17 October announced the launch of a new fund dedicated to European small caps. The new investment vehicle, Lannebo Europa Smabolag, is managed jointly by Carsten Dehn and Ulrik Ellesgaard, who joined the asset management firm in April 2016 from SEB Investment Management. The investment approach for the fund is based on an active selection process for high quality small and mid-sized companies with potential for long-term performance and an acceptable risk level, the Swedish firm says on its website. The fund is domiciled in Sweden, and will primarily target businesses whose market capitalisation does not exceed EUR5bn.
