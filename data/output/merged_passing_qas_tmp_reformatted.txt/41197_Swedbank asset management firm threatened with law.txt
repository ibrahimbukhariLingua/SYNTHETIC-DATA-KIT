Swedbank asset management firm threatened with lawsuit


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Investors are continuing their battle against the asset management company of the bank Swedbank, Robur, which they accuse of selling funds which are falsely claimed to be actively-managed, the Swedish newspaper SvD Näringsliv reports. The Swedish shareholders’ association is now planning to file a lawsuit against the Swedish bank. “We feel that it is clear that Swedbank Robur did not really seek to provide what it sold to savings investors, who should therefore get their money back,” Carl Rosén, director general of the association, tells the newspaper. In July, the Swedish council for consumer-related conflicts, ARN, rejected a collective action against Swedbank Robur. In this context, a lawsuit is the only way to resolve the conflict. The plan is for a single investor, supported by the association, to bring suit. This will serve as a test for all other holders of the shares in question. The Swedish shareholders’ association claims that nearly one million savers in the Allemansfonden and Kapitalinvest funds paid for active management services which were never provided.
