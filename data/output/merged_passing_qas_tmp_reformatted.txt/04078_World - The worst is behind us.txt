World - The worst is behind us


A prudent optimist, but an optimist all the same: ?The worst of the crisis is behind us,? estimates Hideki Takayama, chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors (Japan). ?Japanese investors are certainly very cautious. Currently, aversion to risk is even higher than in the 1990s, but there are some reasons to be prudently optimistic,? says the Japanese manager. The trauma of the crisis Japan went through in the 1990s is still there, and Takayama finds reasons for hope in the shock treatment the US government is going for, particularly its policy of buying up toxic assets, even ?with very short response times.? Although it is undeniable that the fundamentals of the Japanese economy are not good, large companies like Toyota will need to replenish their stocks. At the end of 2008, SSgA (Japan) was at the head of USD60bn in assets, compared with about USD100bn one year earlier. But the trend has turned upward now, says Takayama, adding that, rather than concentrating on alpha, ?we have recently made some efforts to minimise beta risk, which has been well appreciated by investors.?
