The first study, entitled “The Way Ahead: Helping Trustees Navigate the Hedge Fund Sector,” is a practical guide to how investors handle problems and challenges posed by investments in hedge funds which weaken the advantages associated with investment in hedge funds. The next studies in the series, which will run until first quarter 2016, will cover a number of subject such as hedge fund strategies, transparency, and governance. All of this work is done in collaboration with the investor consulting board at AIMA, which includes institutional investors whose exposure to hedge funds totals about USD150bn. The first study points out in particular that in the past ten years, investors engaged in hedge funds are estimated to have made a total of USD1.5trn after commissions.
