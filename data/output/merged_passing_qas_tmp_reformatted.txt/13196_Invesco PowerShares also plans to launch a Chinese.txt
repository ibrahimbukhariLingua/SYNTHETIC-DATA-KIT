Invesco PowerShares also plans to launch a Chinese yuan bond ETF


The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports that a third contender is in the running to become the first to launch an ETF dedicated to bonds denominated in Chinese yuans: Invesco PowerShares, which has submitted an application to the SEC for a license for the PowerShares Asia Pacific Bond Portfolio, a few days after Wisdom Tree made a similar application. Exchange Traded Spreads submitted a similar application in May for the ETS Offshore RMB Bond Fund.
