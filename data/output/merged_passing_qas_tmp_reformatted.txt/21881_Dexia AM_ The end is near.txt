Dexia AM: The end is near


The sale of Dexia AM is fast approaching, Agefi reports. The submission of binding offers is scheduled for mid-June, and the final choice will be made in July. Dexia AM has received 40 expressions of interst, 20 non-binding offers, and has appointed six final candidates, Pierre Mariani, deputy director of Dexia bank, told Les Echos yesterday. No names have been released, but rumours put investment funds including Permira and Bain Capital up against the Australian bank Macquarie. A bid by the latter would make sense: “A major part of the value of Dexia AM is in Australia via Ausbil Dexia,” a business banker tells the newspaper. However, he notes, no bids are said to be coming from any European actors.
