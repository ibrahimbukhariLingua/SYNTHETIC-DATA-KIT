Net inflows of over USD900m for Och-Ziff in first quarter


Assets under management at the US asset management firm Och-Ziff as of 31 March totalled USD30.1bn, compared with USD28.8bn at the end of December 2011, and USD29bn one year previously. An increase of USD1.1bn, or 4% year on year is related to net inflows of USD902.4m, and positive market effects of USD184.3m. As of the end of April, assets under management totalled about USD29.8bn, up by USD1bn compared with the end of December, due to positive market effects, and despite net outflows of USD600m, which are called “relatively small, in historical perspective.” Och-Ziff states that the proportion of assets in pension funds as a part of total assets under management has increased from 24% one year ago to 29% this year. At the same time, assets in funds of funds represent only 17% of total assets, compared with 21% one year ago, as institutional investors are now preferring to invest directly in single hedge funds.
