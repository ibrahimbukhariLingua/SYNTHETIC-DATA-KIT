Are German real estate funds doomed?


In a very long article relayed by Handelsblatt, the weekly newsmagazine Wirtschaftwoche claims that subscribers to open-ended real estate funds currently in the process of being liquidated cannot be sure that they will soon see a redemption of their shares, since the banks which provided credit to the funds will have first dibs on the proceeds of sales of properties. Eurohypo (Commerzbank) and WestImmo (WestLB), two institutions which will soon be liquidated, prove to be the toughest at getting their money back. Open-ended real estate funds in Germany still have assets of EUR85bn, distributed over 19 products.The problem of asset sales for vendors is that the banks are hesitant to finance real estate, and that fund managers are not able to get the amounts for the properties that they had figured them at on their books.
