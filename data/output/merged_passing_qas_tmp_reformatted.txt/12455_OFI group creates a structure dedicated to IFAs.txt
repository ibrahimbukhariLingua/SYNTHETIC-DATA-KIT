OFI group creates a structure dedicated to IFAs


The OFI group on 6 September announced the creation of an affiliate dedicated to independent financial advisers (IFAs), OFI Premium, which will offer wealth management professionals the full range of products and services from the group, via dedicated and personalised solutions. Annie Riaud, director of development at OFI Premium, says that “IFAs have become undeniably powerful actors in savings in France. That’s the reason we wanted to create a structure dedicated to them, which offers products, advice and personalised solutions. IFAs will receive an adapted and reactive service.” The range from OFI Premium will rely on all the expertise of the group: collective management, asset allcoation advising, mandated management, special products, and associated services. In order to assist IFAs in their considerations and investment choices, IFO Premium makes analysis and research available, via specific tools: newsletters, whose titles translate as “Between Us,” “Product Info,” and “Flash VL Weekly,” as well as training, events in cooperation with platforms, iPhone and iPad apps, and a new website. OFI Premium has a team of 10 people. The range of offerings from OFI Premium will be unveiled at the Patrimonia convention at the end of September in Lyon.
