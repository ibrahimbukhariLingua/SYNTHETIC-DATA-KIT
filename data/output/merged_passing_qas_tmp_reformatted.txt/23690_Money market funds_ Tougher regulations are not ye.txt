Money market funds: Tougher regulations are not yet a sure thing


Mary Schapiro, chairwoman of the SEC (independent), is planning to unveil plans to toughen regulatory requirements for money market funds by the end of March, but it is not certain that she will have the necessary 60% majority in the Commission to pass the proposals, the Wall Street Journal reports. In an interview, a Democratic commissioner who generally votes with Schapiro, says that the rules proposed by the chairwoman could cause more risk for the financial system by inciting capital to leave the United States or to move to less well-regulated investments. The SEC consists of the chair, two Democrat and two Republican commissioners.
