Family offices seeking a new real estate investment model


European family offices want to continue to invest in real estate, but if possible, at lower fee levels, with better returns. With this in mind, a group entitled FORE, for Family Office Real Estate, will soon be launching a platform to allow family offices to invest collectively and directly in commercial real estate, Investment Europe reports. The European market represents about EUR115bn, in which family offices are among the largest actors. The partners at FORE are Basil Demeroutis, previously a partner art Capricorn Investment Group, a family office whose assets under management total over USD4.5bn, and Peter Dave, active in the management of commercial real estate for over 30 years.
