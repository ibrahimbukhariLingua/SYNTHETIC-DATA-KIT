Trendy strategies tend to underperform


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Strategies which earn the highest inflows in a given quarter very often see a large decline in their returns in the following quarter, according to a study undertaken in fourth quarter 2010 by TrimTabs, in partnership with Informa Investment Solutions. In other words, following too readily along with the flock may be a highly costly mistake for institutional investors. As an example, TrimTabs points to investorsâ€™ sudden interest in US bonds, and outflows from US equities funds in third quarter 2010. Investors who followed this trend were probably negatively affected by the movements observed recently, as they would have missed the rally in US equities.
