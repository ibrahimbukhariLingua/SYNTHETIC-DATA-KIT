Sovereign funds have a total of over USD6trn in assets


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Assets in sovereign funds took off in 2014, with growth of 17%, putting them over USD6trn (USD6.106trn), according to estimates from the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, reported by Les Echos. In detail, sovereign funds gained nearly USD1trn, while it took them nearly four years to get from USD4trn to USD5trn. The strong rise in these assets is due to three factors: growth on stock markets, net new money, and lastly, a multiplication in the number of sovereign funds. In 2013, direct investments and strategic stakes by sovereign funds reached a record USD175bn in 2013, according to data from the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, far over the USD65bn in 2012, and the USD106bn recorded in 2009. Funds were particularly active in their preferred sectors â€“ real estate, finance, infrastructure, etc. - but their geographical orientation is increasingly broad and no longer concerns only developed markets. Lastly, the economic newspaper observes that most sovereign funds have earned double-digit returns, citing the example of the Norwegian sovereign fund, which in 2013 posted the best returns in its history (16%).
