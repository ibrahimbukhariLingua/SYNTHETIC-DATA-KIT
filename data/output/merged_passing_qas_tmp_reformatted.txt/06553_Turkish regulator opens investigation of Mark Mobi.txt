Turkish regulator opens investigation of Mark Mobius (Templeton AM)


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Turkish securities commission (SPK) has opened an investigation of Mark Mobius, star manager and chairman of Templeton Asset Management, who on 12 October in Malaysia predicted a strong correction of 15-20% for the Turkish market by the end of the year. The next day, the fall materialised, with a drop of 3.1%. the heaviest decline in a single day of trading since 25 May, the Wall Street Journal reports. The investigation came following complaints from retail investors. This type of prediction is not in itself illegal. However, if the regulator can prove that Mobius knowingly made false and misleading statements and that, in addition, he was in a position to profit from a fall in Turkish share prices, he could face a fine.
