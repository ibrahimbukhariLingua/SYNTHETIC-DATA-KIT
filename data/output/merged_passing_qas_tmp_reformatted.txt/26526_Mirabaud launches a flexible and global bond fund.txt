Mirabaud at the beginning of this month launched a flexible and global bond fund, the Global Strategic Bond Fund, which assets of over USD100m. The product is an absolute return fund “which aims to seize all opportunities in the bond universe during various economic cycles, including the current phase of quantitative easing,” a statement explains. It is managed by Andrew Lake, head of high yield and a fixed income specialist, and Fatima Luis, senior portfolio manager, who recently joined the asset management firm. Alexander Lushnikov will reinforce this team based in London. “The primary driver of performance for the new fund will be active management of duration and exposure to credit over economic cycles,” says Lake, who already managed a similar bond fund at Aviva Investors before joining Mirabaud a year ago.
