Europe - Small caps funds penalised for low liquidity of their shares


According to statistics from Bloomberg, relayed by Handelsblatt, the number of illiquid shares in the MSCI Europe Small Caps Index (1,122 shares) increased in January by 85% to 724, and these shares now represent more than EUR50bn in capitalisation. According to the London-based firm Marwyn Investment Management, 90% of the market capitalisation in small caps (those with a cap of less than EUR100m) could not be traded in the past twelve months, and this percentage is expected to rise. On average, small caps funds in Europe lost 37% last year, compared with 31% for large caps.
