Sovereign funds may become active investors


According to a State Street report cited by L’Agefi, “sovereign funds may become more active investors in the future.” They may also “eventually catch up with the most activist institutional investors or alternative funds.” State Street, which counts 37 sovereign funds with assets of over USD1bn, also states that “falling sources of revenues are leading these funds to revise their allocation policies and to avoid higher-risk investments.”
