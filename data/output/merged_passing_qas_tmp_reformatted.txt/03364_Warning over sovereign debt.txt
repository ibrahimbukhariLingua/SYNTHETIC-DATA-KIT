Warning over sovereign debt


In an interview with L’Agefi Switzerland, the head of bond management at Reyl Asset Management, Stéphane Decrauzat, claims that government debt represents the next major issue in credit analysis. “After the credit ratings of Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece were lowered, S&P began a major trend by lowering the outlook for its rating of the United Kingdom to negative. It is not taboo to think that G7 countries could lose their AAA rating. Japan has not had a top rating for a long time, even though its rates are among the lowest, and access to capital markets is not obstructed. Whatever the circumstances, with so much debt and such a degradation of public finances in the G7, how can we jsutify leaving ratings where they are?” says Decrauzat.
