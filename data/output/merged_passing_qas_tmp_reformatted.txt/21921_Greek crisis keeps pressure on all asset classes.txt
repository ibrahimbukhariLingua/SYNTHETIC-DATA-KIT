Greek crisis keeps pressure on all asset classes


Since tension over Greece has picked up again, the Ro-Ro (risk-on, risk-off) risk indicator again shows disoriented and worried markets, Les Echos reports. The index, which measures the correlation between asset classes, has gone haywire in the face of risks of a Greek exit from teh euro. According to the Ro-Ro, all assets, or at any rate many of them, are in the same boat. Whatâ€™s happening in Greece will have globla repercussions (growth, systemic risks, etc.) and impact on many markets, many of them far away, due to the danger of a domino effect. In the eyes of operators, few markets are protected from the danger of a global collapse.
