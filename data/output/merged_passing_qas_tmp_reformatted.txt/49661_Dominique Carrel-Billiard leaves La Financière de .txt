Dominique Carrel-Billiard leaves La Financière de l’Echiquier


Dominique Carrel-Billiard, who joined the general management at La Financière de l’Echiquier in April 2014, has left the asset management firm by common agreement with Didier Le Menetrel, who will now be taking over 100% operational control of the asset management boutique. “Carrel-Billiard structured the organisation of the company very well,” Le Menestrel tells L’Agefi. “The international resources have grown, services related to asset management such as risk analysis and performance attribution have been strengthened, and each profession now has a clear idea of its perimeter. How we need to nourish this infrastructure with management performance, which will allow us to stand out again as a niche actor, and that is the spirit I incarnate.” The economics newspaper points out that the departure comes at a time when assets at the firm had been stagnating since 2014, at EUR7.6bn. Without revealing concrete objectives, La Financière de l’Echiquier is hoping to increase assets to levels nearer those of actors such as DNCA or Comgest. In order to achieve that, the firm has launched a recruitment search for a director of development.
