RDR regulations may eliminate the smallest clients


Nearly two thirds of independent financial advisers estimate that one of the consequences of RDR regulations which will come into force in early 2013 in the UK will be that it will eliminate some retail clients, Fund Web reports. With the introduction of the new rules, portfolios of less than GBP50,000 will no longer be profitable, advisers claim, according to a survey undertaken by Allianz Global Investors of 166 IFAs.The survey also finds that 60% of advisers consider it inevitable that their product range will change, while 36% predict that their services to more modest clients will decline, 16% predict that they will no longer serve clients of this type, and 6% are unsure.About 14% of participants in the survey say that they have raised their prices for the most modest clients, while 13% say they will maintain their level of service to these clients, even if that decision entails losses.
