Assets at DekaBank up 7.7%


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } At a press conference to present results for the DSGV federation of German savings banks, president Georg Fahrenshon announced that AUM at the affiliate DekaBank, which will release its results on 9 April, increased by 7.68% to EUR162.6bn in 2012, compared with EUR151bn as of 31 December 2011. That is partly due to net inflows in fourth quarter, following net outflows in first half. Demand from clients of the savings banks was largely for open-ended real estate funds and diversified funds.Meanwhile, Fahrenschon has also announced that “economic profits” (pre-tax profits according to IFRS accounting standards, plus the results of a valuation of financial instruments) at Deka for 2012 were higher than the EUR383.1m recorded in 2011, when they were 59.6% down on 2010.
