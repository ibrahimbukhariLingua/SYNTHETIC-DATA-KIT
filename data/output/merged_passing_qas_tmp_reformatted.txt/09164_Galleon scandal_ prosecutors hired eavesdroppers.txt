Galleon scandal: prosecutors hired eavesdroppers


Franz Tudor, who was a trader at the alternative management firm Schottenfeld Group, and who has confessed to complicity in fraudulent trading of securities in the Galleon scandal, has admitted that last year he used registration material supplied by the prosecutorâ€™s office and the FBI in an effort to entrap two of his friends and colleagues also implicated in the scandal, the Wall Street Journal reports. In the Galleon insider trading case, there are a total of 21 suspects, at least eight of whom have admitted guilt and are cooperating with the authorities against their co-defendants.
