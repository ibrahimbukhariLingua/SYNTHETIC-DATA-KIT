Deka becomes single outlet for savings banks in securities


The board of directors at DekaBank on Wednesday has approved an extension of the firm’s operations. Deka, which is already the central asset management firm for the German savings banks, will now also offer certificates to retail clients of these banks, with the ultimate objective of making Deka the central asset management firm for the savings banks in the whole securities spectrum, says Oliver Behrens, interim chairman of the board. Deka will also rely on the expertise of the Landesbank Berlin in this area.Meanwhile, Deka has confirmed rumours that the management at Deka Investments, the active open-ended fund and institutional fud asset management specialist affiliate, will be reshuffled. Viktor Moftakhar will become co-CEO on 1 October, alongside Thomas Neiße, while Frank Hagenstein, head of fixed income management, will be appointed CIO, and will also be responsible for equity and multi-asset class management.
