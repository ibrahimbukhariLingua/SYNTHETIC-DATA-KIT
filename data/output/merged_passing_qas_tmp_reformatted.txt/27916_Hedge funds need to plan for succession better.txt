Hedge funds need to plan for succession better


The founders of hedge funds have a hard time planning for succession, the Financial Times finds in a long article on the subject. Most of them have decided that the matter is so complicated that they redeemed investors when they retired, or used their money to finance other firms. The reason is simple, the author of the study finds: the star hedge fund managers tend to be entrepreneus with egos and non-conformist opinions. That does not make them natural mentors or people who are likely to share power. The question of succession is important, since one third of assets in the hedge fund sector are managed by principal-founders who will be 60 years old in the next 10 years, a Deloitte survey finds. Some hedge funds, such as Highbridge Capital, are blazing a trail. Glenn Dubin, who founded the firm 23 years ago, recently handed over control to his “baby,” a former Goldman Sachs banker.
