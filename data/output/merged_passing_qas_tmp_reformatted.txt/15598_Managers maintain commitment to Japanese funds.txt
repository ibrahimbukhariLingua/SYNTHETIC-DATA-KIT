Managers maintain commitment to Japanese funds


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Disinterest in the Japanese market in the past few years means that the number of funds investing in the Land of the Rising Sun managed in Paris is not large. And the population of funds in question – like the asset management firms that offer them - is a mixed bag. However, though these funds have seen heavy losses since the beginning of this week, fund managers have had the same behaviour: that is, not to freeze the funds, to avoid panic selling by investors who may put the existence of the fund in danger. Managers we have spoken to are insisting that they will continue to manage the funds pragmatically, with some admiration for the fact that the Tokyo stock market has remained open, and taking Japanese stalwartness in the face of such a dramatic situation as a powerful sign. Though no fund closures are planned, managers have made a few trades. “Concretely,” one of them tells us, “investments in businesses located on the east coast of the country, or which rely on lots of subcontractors, have been replaced by companies which have been preserved because they are located in the west, or do a lot of work abroad.” However, as expected, positions on shares in the consumer or luxury sectors have been cut back. Yet this is something short of a major revision of the portfolio. It is easy to see that it is impossible to predict the real impact of the disaster. The Japanese market will remain a market for stock-pickers, say many specialists, pointing out that the valuations of many shares have been attractive for a long time. The irony is that the market has seen a renaissance in the past few weeks as a result of favourable economic indicators. In the longer term, managers are divided, knowing that many investors will steer clear of the market for a long time, but also aware that the Japanese are never stronger than in adversity. But how long will it take to recover from a disaster like this?
