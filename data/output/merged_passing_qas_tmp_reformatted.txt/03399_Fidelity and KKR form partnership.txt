Fidelity and KKR form partnership


Fidelity is teaming up with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Financial Times reports. The agreement provides that retail clients of Fidelity will have access to futures IPOs of companies owned by KKR. This is the first time such an agreement has been signed, although Fidelity has had similar arrangements in the past with investment banks.
