Asset management firms throw their hands up


At the first investment fund conference held by the Börsen-Zeitung, Thomas Neiße, president of the German BVI association of asset management firms, admitted that professionals have made mistakes and lost clients for emotional reasons, since they highlighted the prospects of returns on products while not mentioning the risks they involved.In addition, in the past 10 years, fund managers have not kept their promises in terms of returns, due to the falling markets. Lastly the industry overworked clients by failing to explain arduous products to them in clear language.Now, winning back the confidence of investors is a Herculean task. The industry needs to start again from zero, and be modest, the BVI president says.
