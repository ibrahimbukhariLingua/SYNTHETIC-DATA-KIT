Barclays recruits in Singapore


The British firm Barclays has set up a team of three people in Singapore to develop activities with local independent managers, Asian Investor reports. The team will be led by Cedric Lizin, who will retain his responsibilities as country head fo Japan and head of ultra-high net worth clients (UHNW) in the Asia-Pacific region. He will be assisted by Annabelle Chow and Josephine Koh, both of whom join from Credit Suisse. Independent managers manage about 5% of assets at private banks in Singapore, compared with 30% in Switzerland, but Barclays estimates that the segment is expected to develop in the next few years.
