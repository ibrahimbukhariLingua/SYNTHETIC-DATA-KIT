Scottish government authorised to issue its own bonds


In the midst of a debate about the independence of the country, the British government has authorised its Scottish counterpart the right to issue its own bonds from 2015, according to reports on the BBC, Money Marketing reports. The Scottish government may issue up to GBP2.2bn of its own bonds. This possibility is related to the increased borrowing capacity of Scotland, which will be effective next year as part of the Scotland Act.
