EFAMA critical of Commission’s tax proposals


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The European asset management association (EFAMA) on 18 October called the reasons offered by the European Commission for introducing a tax on financial activities in the asset management sector “seriously biased.” EFAMA noted that the Commission does not take into account the fact that the asset management sector has not received government support, and that it does not enjoy the security assurances such aid would offer. An increase in costs related to the introduction of a tax on financial activities would probably be borne by the final consumer, i.e., the investor. The phenomenon could result in an undesired distortion in the matter of small investors’ choice between direct investment in equities and investment via collective funds. That evolution “should concern governments, who are seeking to encourage investors to invest responsibly for retirement,” says Peter de Proft, chairman of EFAMA, cited in a statement. EFAMA therefore encourages the Commission to enter into dialogue with the various sectors of the financial industry to ensure that measures are “targeted, effective, and adapted.”
