Concentrated portfolios outperform others


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Investors who select actively-managed funds should invest in portfolios which track a benchmark index, or else they run a risk of paying high fees in exchange for underperformance, a new study by State Street Global Advisors cited by the Financial Times shows. Brian Routledge and Anthony Forcione, the authors of the study, feel that “high conviction” funds, which concentrate on a restricted number of shares, tend to outperform over the long term, despite higher volatility. By comparison, portfolios which invest in a large number of shares dilute the impact of the “best ideas” of managers.
