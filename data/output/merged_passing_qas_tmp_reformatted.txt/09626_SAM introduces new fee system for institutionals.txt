SAM introduces new fee system for institutionals


The Swiss firm SAM Sustainable Asset Management (USD14.8bn in assets, Robeco group), has announced the establishment of a “sustainable” system of charges for institutional clients. It will include on the one hand, a set payment to cover the costs of the establishment and operation of mandates, and on the other hand, a commission based on performance, at a percentage established in agreement with the client and in accordance with the client’s long-term investment objectives, with the more ambitious objectives translating to proportionally higher fees. This implies that the investor awarding the mandate and the management firm will agree about the investment horizon before setting up the investment strategy, and that the investment firm may receive a performance commission throughout the market cycle. This new fee structure will be made available through segregated accounts. Fee levels will be set on the basis of the number and complexity of services which the client selects, with each strategy carrying its own fee rate. All custom services, such as desiderata on the basis of region and cap size, will give rise to supplemental charges.
