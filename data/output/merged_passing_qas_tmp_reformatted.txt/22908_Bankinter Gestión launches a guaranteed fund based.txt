Bankinter Gesti√≥n launches a guaranteed fund based on Eurostoxx 50


On 30 March, the Spanish regulator CNMV has registered the Bankinter Eurostoxx 50 Garantizado fund, which aims on the one hand to guarantee initially invested capital at maturity (on 30 November 2015), and on the other hand to deliver a return which will depend on the performance of the Eurostoxx 50 index in the meanwhile. In the worst case, there will be no additional return, and in the best case, the return will be equivalent to 6.50% per year, depending on a 60% participation rate in gains limited to 42% during the period of reference. From 8 May (subscriptions will close on 7 May), the portfolio will be invested in bonds denominated in euros rated at least A-, with a maturity similar to that of the fund.
