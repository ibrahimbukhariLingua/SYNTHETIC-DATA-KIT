Robeco launches a low-risk emerging markets fund


On 14 February 2011 Robeco launched the Emerging Conservative Equities. The fund gives the opportunity to invest in emerging markets – but with less risk. The new fund is a result of research into the volatility effect conducted by Pim van Vliet en David Blitz from the Quantative Equities team. The research showed that low risk doesn’t need to lead to lower returns. Due to the low risk investment objective the fund invests in different stocks than traditional emerging market funds. This increases the possibility to diversify.Fund managers of the new fund are Pim van Vliet and Arlette van Ditshuizen. Pim van Vliet and Arlette van Ditshuizen also manage the Robeco Global Conservative Equity fund and the Robeco European Conservative Equities fund.
