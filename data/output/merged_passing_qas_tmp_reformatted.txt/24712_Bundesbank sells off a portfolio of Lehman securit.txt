Bundesbank sells off a portfolio of Lehman securitisations


The US hedge fund Lone Star is reported to have bought up a portfolio of securitised real estate mortgages which Lehman had pooled together in a portfolio entitled Excalibur, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports.Joachim Niegel, a board member at the German central bank, claims that the operation will ultimately result in minimal or no losses. The nominal value of Excalibur had been USD2.16bn, but since the Lehman bankruptcy, redemptions and interests have already reduced that sum by EUR800m. Lone Star declined to comment on the reports.
