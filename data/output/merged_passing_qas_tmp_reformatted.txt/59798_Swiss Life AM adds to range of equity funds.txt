Swiss Life AM adds to range of equity funds


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Swiss Life Asset Management (Swiss Life AM) on 26 July announced that it is adding to its range of “Minimum Volatility” equity products, with the launch of Swiss Life Funds (Lux) Equity Global Minimum Volatility I. The new vehicle will invest in global equity markets, and offers investors “a global geographical diversification solution, with the objective of offering an optimised risk/return pairing,” the asset management firm says in a statement. The management process is based on a “minimum variance” approach, which respects a set of constraints defined by the management team. A liquidity filter is applied in an analysis of the investable universe (MSCI World), while the weighting of each share invested in must represent 0.05% to 1% of the total portfolio. The portfolio is composed of at least 150 stocks. “No style constraint is set on the stocks,” Swiss Life AM adds. The new fund is the fourth investment solution in the Minimum Volatility equity line, which includes the following funds: Swiss Life Funds (F) Equity France Minimum Volatility C, Swiss Life Funds (F) Equity Euro Zone Minimum Volatility I and Swiss Life Funds (F) Equity Europe Minimum Volatility I.
