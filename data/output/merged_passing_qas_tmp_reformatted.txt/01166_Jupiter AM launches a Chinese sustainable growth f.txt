Jupiter Asset Management is to launch a UCITS III fund for investors seeking to gain exposure to China’s sustainable growth story. The Jupiter China Sustainable Growth fund (Sicav), which will be managed by China fund manager Philip Ehrmann, is a sub-fund of the Jupiter Global Fund Sicav. It will open for institutional investment on 11th December and for retail investors in the first quarter of 2010.The fund will aim to achieve long term capital growth through investing in companies which will benefit from the secular trends associated with sustainable environmental, social and economic growth in China. It will focus on key growth markets within the Chinese economy such as energy, water, agriculture, transport, real estate and construction, waste management and healthcare and education.Although the fund is not intended to be a ‘green’ investment vehicle, Philip Ehrmann will draw on the insights of Jupiter’s Sustainability & Governance team, lead by Emma Howard Boyd, to inform his analysis of particular businesses and industries.
