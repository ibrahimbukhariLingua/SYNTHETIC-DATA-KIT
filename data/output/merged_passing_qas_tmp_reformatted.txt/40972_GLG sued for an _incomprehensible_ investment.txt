GLG sued for an “incomprehensible” investment


Richard Desmond, founder of the British Northern & Shell media group, is seeking GBP20m in court from GLG Partners, an affiliate of Man Group, following losses on an “incomprehensible” investment, Bloomberg reports. Desmond explains that GLG Partners advised him to enter into a derivative transaction with Credit Suisse in 2007 as a counterparty. He invested about GBP50m in a product known as Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance, a sort of swap. “It was incomprehensible except to an expert,” Desmond’s lawyers claim. Desmond says that GLG did not inform him of the risks. He lost GBP20m.
