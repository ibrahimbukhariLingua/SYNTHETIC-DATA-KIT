Aquila Capital renames a fund


The German asset management firm Aquila Capital, a specialist in alternative strategies, has decided to revise the investment process for its long-only, multi-asset class strategy, taking into account the latest developments in quantitative finance and the artificial intelligence sector. In this context, the AC Risk Parity Fund has been renamed AC â€“ Adaptive Diversification Fund. The investment process includes an advanced range of indicators to measure the attractiveness of the market, and aims for stable returns independently of market cycles. The fund is based on strategies developed by the Systematic Trading Group from Aquila, which was launched in January 2017 and manages equity strategies and systematic multi-asset class futures representing USD2.5bn in assets under management. The team, which manages quantitative strategies, includes Urs Schubiger, Fabian Dori and Egon Ruetsche, both quantitative strategists.
