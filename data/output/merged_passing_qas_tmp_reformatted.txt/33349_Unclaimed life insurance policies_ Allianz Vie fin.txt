Unclaimed life insurance policies: Allianz Vie fined


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } After Cardif Assurance Vie and CNP Assurances, Allianz Vie is next. The sanctions committee of the prudential and resolution control authority (ACPR) have issued an official reprimand against the insurer with a pecuniary fine of EUR50m, for “failing to adapt its organisation and budget, until a recent date, to the new requirements concerning the identification of deceased policyholders and the search for beneficiaries.” The sanction, under the law of 17 Decembe 2007, is the highest yet, as Cardif and CNP Assurance respectively got of with a reprimand and fines of EUR10m and EUR40m.“Alliance Vie initially diverted virtually all of its portfolio of life insurance policies (99.5%) from its consultations with the national identity register for physical persons (RNIPP),” the reguator says. “As a consequence, for several years, Allianz Vie identified only a very small number of deceased policyholders. The large number of policyholders whose decease became known after wider consultations of this registry from October 2013 reveals a massive and prolonged shortfall in the previous period at the business, with respect to its obligations in this area. Despite the small number of searches to be performed, due to this shortfall, serious inadequacies were observed in the diligence of the enterprise in identifying beneficiaries of insurance policies which were resolved by the decease of the subscriber, and to inform them of the stipulation to their profit,” the ACPR continues.With this verdict, the Commission has also sanctioned failures to fulfil contractual obligations to execute by set dates, revaulation of death benefit, and to establish the list of resolved life insurance policies which include unpaid sums. It also found that this resulted in prejudice to beneficiaries, and more generally, had a negative impact on the confidence of policyholders in life insurance products.
