The passage of US tax reforms was welcomed by investors, as shown by sales of assets and profit-taking. As a result, equity funds posted outflows in the week ending 20 December of a net USD14.5bn, the highest outflows since Brexit, while bond funds saw outflows of USD3.2bn (the largest of the past 52 weeks), and gold funds saw outflows of USD400m, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, based on statistics from the global flow evolution monitoring specialist EPFR Global..Unsurprisingly, US equity funds suffered most, with outflows of USD14.6bn, the largest weekly outflows since the election of Donald Trump.European equities, great favourites of the market this year, suffered a third consecutive week of redemptions, for the first time since October 2016, with USD0.8bn flowing out of the asset class this week. Only Japanese and emerging market equity funds were spared, with modest inflows of USD1bn and USD1.4bn, respectively.In bonds, high yield funds suffered most, with USD5.3bn in redemptions, for the eighth consecutive week of outflows from this market segment. This corresponds to the longest negative series on record since the financial crisis of 2008.
