MSCI unveils two Japan ESG indices


After FTSE Russell (see elsewhere in NewsManagers), MSCI has become the next to launch two new environmental, social and governance (ESG) indices based on Japan. The two indices are the MSCI Japan Empowering Woman Index and the MSCI Japan ESG Select Leaders. Like those from FTSE Russell, the two indices have been selected by the Japanese Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) as benchmarks for its ESG investment strategy. The MSCI Japan Empowering Woman Index is composed of companies whose initiatives in the area of gender diversity, determined by ESG research by MSCI, works to encourage women to enter the labour market or to return to work. A recent study found that a higher percentage of women in the labour market brings benefits for the Japanese economy. The Japanese government has therefore set objectives to encourage women to participate in the job market more. The second index, MSCI Japan ESG Select Leaders, targets businesses with the best ESG profile compared with their counterparts in their sector. The index is designed using the ESG ratings model from MSCI, and targets companies with the highest ESG ratings within the MSCI Japan IMI Top 500 Index.
