ICE to create new platform for ETF


Intercontinental Exchange, Inc., an operator of global exchanges and clearing houses and provider of data and listings services, announced its intention to launch a new open-architecture, centralized industry platform to facilitate creation and redemption orders for exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This new platform, expected to begin operations in 2019, subject to regulatory approval, will employ innovative functionality and establish standards to simplify the primary market trading process, which will bring more efficiency and transparency to the process. BlackRock will be one of ICE’s development partners and has executed a memorandum of understanding with ICE to support the new platform.The U.S. ETF market has seen tremendous growth. According to the Investment Company Institute, net assets grew six-fold over the last decade to $3.4 trillion. Fixed income ETFs have been one of the fast growing segments within ETFs, with compounded annual growth of over 30% during the last ten years.“In order to fulfill its next phase of growth, the ETF industry needs to standardize the process for creating and redeeming shares, particularly in fixed income. ICE has a well-established track record of bringing innovative technology to drive efficiencies and solve the market’s most complex challenges,” said Intercontinental Exchange President Ben Jackson. “With a diverse range of investors embracing ETFs, participants in the ecosystem will benefit from the transparency and scalability these standards will foster.”
