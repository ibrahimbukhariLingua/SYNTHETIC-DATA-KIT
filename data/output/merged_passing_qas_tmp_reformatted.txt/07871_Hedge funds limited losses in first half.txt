Hedge funds limited losses in first half


In June, the Hedge Fund Researchâ€™s hedge fund index (HFRX) was down 0.94%, meaning that losses in first half were limited to 1.25, while the S&P 500 lost 5% and 7.6% in June and first half respectively, the Wall Street Journal reports. In general, hedge fund managers avoided big losses because they stayed defensive, says Chris Jackson, a fund of hedge fund manager at SFG Asset Advisors. The main hedge fund managed by Och-Ziff Capital Management lost 0.46% in June, but gained 1.39% in January-June. David Einhorn made more than 2% in June for Greenlight Capital Re, putting its performance for first half at 0.6%.
