The evening beforethe broadcast, the Netherlands-based financial group stated that ithad declined an invitation to a debate in the studio, arguing thatneither the NGO nor the programme had sent the report to the firm tobe read in preparation for the debate.Ina statement, ABN Amro says that palm oil should be produced in themost sustainable manner possible, and added that a boycott of theingredient would not be realistic, since it is a component in manyproducts. “In its lending policy, ABN Amro explicitly excludesexpropriations and illegal deforestation, two important potentialnegative effects of irresponsible production of palm oil. We don’twant anything to do with these practices.”“Thedomain of investment is a different story. ABN Amro does not investon its own behalf. When there is reference to an investment, we aretalking about investments by our retail and private clients. Theseclients are given the choice to make their own investment decisionsor to entrust the management of their assets to ABN Amro. Ultimately,they are the ones who decide how they invest and in what assets. Wealways encourage our clients to invest sustainably and our newclients are offered a sustainable investor profile as a standardoption,” ABN Amro explains.
