La Française REPI signs a new deal in Amsterdam


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } La Française Real Estate Partners International has acquired an office property located at Muiderstraat 1, in the centre of Amsterdam, on behalf of a collective real estate investment body reserved for institutional clients of La Française, The five-story building, renovated in 2012/2013, has 2,731 square metres of office and business space, and is fully leased. “We are making our second acquisition in the Netherlands. The limited supply of modern office space in Amsterdam and the currently strong demand can be expected to have a positive impact on the valuation of the property and the floors to lease. We are continuing to seek investment opportunities that are similar in terms of quality and profile,” says Jens Goettler, managing director for Germany at La Française Real Estate Partners International.
