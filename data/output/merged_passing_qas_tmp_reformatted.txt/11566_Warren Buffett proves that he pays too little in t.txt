Warren Buffett proves that he pays too little in taxes


Warren Buffett, chairman & CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has explained his campaign to raise taxes for the rich in a letter to Congressman Tim Huelskamp, a Republican from Kansas, the Wall Street Journal reports. Buffett says that he made USD62.85m in 2010, but paid less than USD7m in taxes, which represents an effective tax rate of only 17.4%. That is lower than the 18.2% paid by taxpayers with incomes of USD103,000 to USD163,000.
