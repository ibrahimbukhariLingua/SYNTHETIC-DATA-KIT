Credit Suisse may be fined USD1.2bn


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Geneva lawyer Douglas Horning claims that Credit Suisse may pay a fine of USD1.2bn in its taxation clash with the United States. The bank HSBC may be fined as much as USD1bn. “In the eyes of the United States, five banks which are currently facing charges are more guilty than UBS, and so the fines will have to be larger, at least for HSBC and Credit Suisse,” says Hornung, in an interview in a supplement to Agefi Switzerland. UBS paid USD780m in fines, and handed over information on 4,500 clients. Julius Baer may face a fine in the hundreds of millions. As to the cantonal banks of Zurich and Basel, some of which estimate are in a bad position, the Geneva lawyer explains that the United States does not want a series of bankruptcies of banks, but to collect large fines. In the matter of the HSBC employee who in late April lost a case before the Swiss Federal court against a decision of the Federal Council to reveal his name, Hornung, his lawyer, says that four civil actions are still in progress.
