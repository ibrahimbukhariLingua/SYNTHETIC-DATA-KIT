European pension funds pull out of equities


According to the most recent edition of the European Asset Allocation Survey by the consultant Mercer, 20% of 1,200 pension funds surveyed are planning to further reeduce their allocation to domestic or international equities, Investment Europe reports, stating that the percentage of British funds planning to reduce their exposure to British equities is as high as 38.8%, compared with 1.4% who are planning to increase it. Average allocation of British funds to equities is down 4 percentage points year on year, at 43%. The survey also finds that this year, 50% of resopndents are now invested in alternative assets, compared with 40% last year, but that exposure is generally limited to 3-5% per alternative asset class. Among continental pension funds, 20% have made an allocation to hedge funds, emerging markets and high yield bonds, while British funds prefer diversified growth funds, asset allocation hedge funds (GTAA) and funds of hedge funds.
