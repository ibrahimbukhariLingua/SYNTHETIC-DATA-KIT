BNP Paribas-BNL launches a small cap corporate bond fund in Italy


The Italian bank BNL (BNP Paribas group) will launch a fund of EUR150m after this summer, which will invest in Italian small cap corporate bonds, Il Sole – 24 Ore reports. The fund is reserved for institutional investors, and will replicate an analogue product in France. It will buy senior bonds issued by small and mid-cap businesses with a maximal duration of 5 years. 30 to 40 bond issues, created ad-hoc, will be targeted. Il Sole – 24 Ore notes that many initiatives of this type are being created at present, due to a dearth of bank financing.
