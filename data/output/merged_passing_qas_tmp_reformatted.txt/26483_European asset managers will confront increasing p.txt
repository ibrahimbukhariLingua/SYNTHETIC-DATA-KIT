European asset managers will confront increasing pressure on profit margins


Starting next year and in the following years, the pressure on margins is expected to increase in the asset management sector, with competition getting more severe and activities that generate commissions falling, the financial ratings agency Fitch Ratings estimates in a study released on 24 October.The average margin on assets under management for European actors in the sector last year totalled 40 basis points, compared with 44 basis points in 2010. This decline, which is not considerable, is a sign of the long-term risk of pressure on margins. This development is partly related to the abandonment of high-margin equity products. “We estimate that this movement is expected to continue due to a growing trend for institutional investors to favour passive investments,” Fitch says, adding that the marings will also fall due to the gradual adoption of low-cost products (ETFs and target-date funds) by retail investors. This trend is structural, although a regain in interest in equities may temporarily boost margins. Competition may also intensify in Europe due to the relative openness of the market to foreign investors, attracted by the efficiency and simplicity of UCITS funds and the UCITS brand. US investors have responded favourably to the attactiveness of the UCITS brand, which is also beginning to win over Asian and Latin American mangers.
