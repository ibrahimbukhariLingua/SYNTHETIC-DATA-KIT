Switzerland - Madoff: UBS’s defense is fragile


UBS will have a hard time avoiding any responsibility for the Madoff scandal, Ignites Europe reports on 7 January, citing lawyers. The Swiss bank was, until recently, the depositary for the LuxAlpha Sicav. Last month, UBS defended itself by pointing to the subscription terms of LuxAlpha, which stated that the firm was not the guardian of the fund’s assets. Jean Bricher, a partner at Brucher & Associés, says that clauses of this nature exonerating the firm from responsibility are not valid under Luxembourg law.
