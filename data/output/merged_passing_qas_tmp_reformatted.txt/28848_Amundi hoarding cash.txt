Diversified funds from Amundi are curently 55% positioned on cash, as economic outlooks weigh against investing in higher-risk assets.In a letter sent on 27 June and cited by Bloomberg, Alain Pitous, deputy CIO of Amundi, says the cash allocation for absolute return funds was doubled last month to 30% due to sales of high yield bonds and of emerging market equity and bonds.
