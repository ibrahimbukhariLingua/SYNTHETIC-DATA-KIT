Clients of pension funds want transparency for sustainable strategies


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } More than one Swiss citizen out of two (52%) would like to know what countries and what businesses their pension contributions are invested in, according to a survey of 1210 policyholders at pension funds in all three language regions of Switzerland, presented on 4 September by the RobecoSAM company. An interesting detail is that 56% of German speakers would like more information, while only 45% of French speakers and only 29% of Italian speakers would. Another finding of the survey is that nearly three out of four people (72%) would like their pension fund to take environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) aspects into account in their investment policies. Only 5% of them are against it. German and French speakers are highly favourable (78% and 65% respectively), while far fewer of Italians are (39%). It is to be noted, however, that respondents are not prepared to sacrifice returns on the altar of respect for ESG criteria. More than one quarter of those surveyed (27%) say these criteria must only be taken into account if they have no impact on returns. 40% of respondents say they are prepared to give up some part of their returns to take these investment criteria into account. 20% would even be prepared to suffer a loss of half or more of their returns if such criteria preside over investments by their pension fund.
