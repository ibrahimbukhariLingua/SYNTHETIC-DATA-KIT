New money market instruments for British insurers


After an extensive consultation, the association of British insurers (ABI) has decided to create a new investment sector within the money markets, entitled “Deposit & Treasury.” The constraints for the new category for available instruments and their maturities will be stricter than those for the current sector, which will nonetheless continue to exist, the association says in a statement. The new category, which will be available from 1 November, will respond to investors’ desire to have a sector in the wake of the crisis in which capital preservation will be the main priority. “This initiative is good news for consumers. It will make life easier for investors seeking stability in a volatile context. No sector can cover all risks, but this new segment will consist only of the simplest available funds,” says Maggie Craig, director of life and savings at the association. Among the instruments to be made available in the new category will be time deposits, deposit certificates, and British government bonds. All instruments will be denominated in pounds sterling, and will have a maximal time to maturity of 12 months.
