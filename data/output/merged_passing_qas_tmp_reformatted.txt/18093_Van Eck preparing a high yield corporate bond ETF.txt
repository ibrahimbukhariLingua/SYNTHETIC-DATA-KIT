Van Eck preparing a high yield corporate bond ETF


The US firm Van Eck Global has submitted a license application to the SEC to launch a forthcoming ETF of the Market Vectors range which would be based on high yield corporate bonds, replicating an exclusive index covering US and international high yield securities denominated in US dollars, Index Universe reports. The Markets Vector High Yield/Treasury Bond ETF fund would be authorised to short-sell bonds and Treasury notes in order to protect itself against interest rate changes.
