Skandia launches 20 single manager funds


Skandia has confirmed that it is to launch a unique range of 20 “single manager” funds, which will enable financial advisers to access institutional fund managers for the first time. The new fund range will be known as “Signature” and will be managed by Skandia Investment Group (SIG). Signature will contain the best managers across 10 asset classes, as identified by SIG’s 40+ investment team. The fund manager line up for the range is still to be confirmed but all of them will be world class fund managers, most of whom are not accessible to investors because they traditionally only undertake institutional, rather than retail, business. Importantly, each fund will contain only one manager, thus the range will compete directly with the broader retail universe, rather than just multi-manager solutions. The Signature range will cover 10 different investment sectors with some sectors containing multiple fund options, others will have one. The sectors and number of funds are: property, fixed interest, international fixed interest, equity, European, North American, Japanese, Far East ex , Global specialist.
