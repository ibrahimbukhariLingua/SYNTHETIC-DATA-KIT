Germany - JPMorgan recruits a manager from Goldman Sachs


The Swede Håkan Strängh on Wednesday began in his new position as market manager at the JP Morgan private bank for Germany, replacing Andreas Muth, who left the firm last autumn. Strängh joins the firm from Goldman Sachs Frankfurt, where he spent 16 years, and was most recently a senior private banker. He will report to both Riccardo Pironti, head of private bank for continental and western Europe, and Klaus Altenburg, chief executive for Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.
