GLG to lay off 70 from a workforce of 450


According to reports in Investment Week, the alternative manager GLG Partners will lay off about 70 people out of 450, following its acquisition of SGAM UK in April. The layoffs will affect positions in the back office and support functions, but it appears that Hugh Grieves, manager of the Technology Equity fund, will also be leaving the firm. Meanwhile, GLG will also continue to rationalise its range of funds, and will be able to make several of its best-performing funds, including the Alpha Select Fund, available to British retail investors.
