Julius Baer completes takeover of international wealth management activities of Merrill Lynch


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Julius Baer has concluded its integration of the international wealth management (IWM) activities of the US firm Merrill Lynch. The banking group on 21 September announced the transfer of the Indian activities, which were viewed as an important stage in the operation. The volume of assets transferred in this stage represented over CHF6bn. Assets under management transferred under the agreement with Merrill Lynch reached the target defined as CHF52bn to CHF72bn, but at the bottom of the range. “This transaction represents a long-term investment in our future and marks an additional stage in the expansion of our franchise in Asia,” CEO Boris Collardi states. The takeover of the international wealth management activities of Merrill Lynch outside the United States was announced in August 2012. The sale price will represent 1.2% of the assets under management transferred, which will come to CHF620bn to CHF860bn.
