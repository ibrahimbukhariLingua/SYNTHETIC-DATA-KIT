Italian asset management becomes competitive


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In an interview with Il Sole – 24 Ore, Domenico Siniscalco, chairman of the Italian association of asset managers, Assogestioni, welcomes the recent reforms to the tax regime for Italian-registered funds, which finally places them on a level playing field with foreign-registered funds. “The elimination of this burden does not mean that the race is won, but at least now the possibility exists,” he says. Italian funds are now taxed on capital gains at exit, and not on day-to-day gains. Siniscalco is also positive about the tax regime approved last July, which is now in the process of being passed, according to which European asset management firms (and thus also Italian firms which in recent years moved their domicile to avoid Italian taxation) will be allowed to transfer their headquarters to Italy and receive advantageous tax conditions for a period of three years.
