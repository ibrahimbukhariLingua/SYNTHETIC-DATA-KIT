EFG Private Bank fined for failures in its anti-money laundering controls


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has fined EFG Private Bank GBP4.2 million, or approximately EUR5million, for failing to take reasonable care to establish and maintain effective anti-money laundering (AML) controls for high risk customers. «The failings were serious and lasted for more than three years», the FCA underlines.As part of a thematic review of how UK banks were managing money laundering risk in higher risk situations, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) visited EFG Private Bank, the UK private banking subsidiary of the EFGI Group, a global private banking group, based in Switzerland, in January 2011. That visit and further investigation caused serious concern to the FSA. The investigation found that EFG had not fully put its AML policies into practice. Of particular concern was that 17 of 36 reviewed customer files, opened between December 2007 and January 2011, contained customer due diligence that highlighted significant money laundering risks, but insufficient records of how the bank’s senior management had mitigated those risks. Of these 17 files, the FSA found that the risks highlighted in 13 files related to allegations of criminal activity or that the customer had been charged with criminal offences including corruption and money laundering. EFG settled at an early stage of the investigation and qualified for a 30% discount on its fine. Without the discount the fine would have been GBP6 million.
