Investment advisers slow to train their successors


In the United States, most registered investment advisers appear not to be in any hurry to train their successors and don’t seem concerned about what becomes of their clients after they stop their activities either, according to a survey published recently by Cerulli Associats. Only 30% of advisers have adopted an explicit continuity plan. Statistics from Cerulli indicate that about 43% of advisers are over 55 years old, and that 53% of clients of these advisers are 50 to 70 years old. “Advisers are increasingly having trouble attracting young investors,” says Kenton Shirk, associate director at Cerulli, adding that the infinite possibilities which the internet offer along with access to investment platforms represents a real competition for the adviser sector. In othe words, the independent financial adviser sector is in a profound crisis, which may eventually result in a reconfiguration of the sector. Advisers are expected to extend their range of products and services in particular, to offer tax planning services, for example. This could eventually result in partnerships with tax experts. It may also be supposed that the competition from the internet and platforms will result in a consolidation in the sector, which will be expected to have a lot fewer small structures.
