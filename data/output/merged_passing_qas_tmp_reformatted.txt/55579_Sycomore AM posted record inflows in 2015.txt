The French asset management firm has reached record assets of EUR3.4bn. “This is higher than the peak of 2007,” says Deltour. In this environment, “we are continuing to invest,” the chairman of Sycomore AM stated, adding that he has recruited two fund managers in 2015, and announced that he is seeking to recruit two more this year. The asset management firm currently has 44 employees, including 14 “seasoned” managers. The product range has also been added to, with the launch of two socially responsible funds: Sycomore Eco Solutions, a fund investing in equities in publicly-traded businesses which contribute to the energy and ecological transition, and Sycomore Happy@Work, a fund centered on human capital. To continue in this SRI vein, this year Sycomore AM is merging Sélection Responsable and Sycomore Eurocap, so that Sycomore Sélection Responsable “becomes the flagship for the asset management firm in European equities.”
