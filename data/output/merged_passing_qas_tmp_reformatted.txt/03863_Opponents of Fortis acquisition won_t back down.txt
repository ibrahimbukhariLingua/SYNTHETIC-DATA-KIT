Opponents of Fortis acquisition won’t back down


The Financial Times reports that shareholders opposed to a sale of Fortis to BNP Paribas are mobilizing ahead of a general shareholders’ meeting on Tuesday, which will vote on the possible sale. The Modrikamen agency, which represents 2,300 shareholders, is also planning to take legal action to obtain the list of voters, which would delay the vote.
