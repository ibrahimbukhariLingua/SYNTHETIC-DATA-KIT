Bedlam AM closes its doors


Bedlam Asset Management has moved to close its business after the departure of its chief investment officer Ian McCallum led to fears of mass redemptions.This departure resulted in an automatic review both by large investors and by one consulting firm, whose clients account for over 40% of Bedlam’s AUM."As a result of the change, that consultant revised the recommendation on Bedlam to ‘sell’. Many clients are not allowed to invest with managers with such a rating, whether warranted or not. The result is that a considerable net outflow is expected, whilst potential new clients are almost certain to delay any investment decision. The consequences would be a material fall in fee income, with resultant losses at an unacceptable level. Thus although the reception from existing clients to recent performance has been universally good, and that from prospective investors better than for several years, the company now has almost nochance of achieving a sustainable critical mass», according to a statement.
