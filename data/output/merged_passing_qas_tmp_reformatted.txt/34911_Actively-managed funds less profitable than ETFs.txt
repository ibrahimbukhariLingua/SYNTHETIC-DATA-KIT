Actively-managed funds less profitable than ETFs


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Investors in actively-managed equity funds achieve lower returns than those investors in ETFs. Equity funds dedicated to Europe in particular earn lower returns than ETFs, according to a study performed by the advising specialist private bank quirin. Over a five-year period, investors in European equity funds have returns nearly 11% lower than those earned from investment in the Stoxx 50 index. The study reaches the same conclusion for all marktes. The only exception to the rule is short-term, as in some cases asset managers manage to beat their benchmarks. The tracking error in favour of ETFs is 4.4 percentage points for emerging markets, and 7.9 points for US equities.
