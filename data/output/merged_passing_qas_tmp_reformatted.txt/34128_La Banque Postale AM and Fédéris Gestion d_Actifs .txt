p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } A movement of consolidation in the French asset management sector may be expected to accelerate somewhat. According to information in the newspaper Les Echos, La Banque Postale and Malakoff Médéric are currently in talks to merge their respective asset management firms, La Banque Postale Asset Management (LBP AM) and Fédéris Gestion d’Actifs (Fédéris GA). “Talks are in progress, but they are at a very preliminary stage,” an anonymous source close to the negotiations, cited by the economic newspaper, says. “The question is how to work together in the interests of clients and employees.” If it goes through, the merger would be one of the largest in France since the creation of Amundi, from the merger of Société Générale and Crédit Agricole, the newspaper reports. LBP AM has EUR147bn in assets, while Fédéris GA is of a more modest size, with about EUR25bn in assets under management.
