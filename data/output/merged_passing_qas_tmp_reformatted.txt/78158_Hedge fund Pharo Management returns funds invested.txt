Hedge fund Pharo Management returns funds invested by Saudi Arabia


The British hedge fund Pharo Management in December snubbed an investment of about $300m from the central bank of Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA), sources familiar with the matter have told Bloomberg. Guillaume Fonkenell, 54, the founder of Pharo Management, told investors in January that the decision was taken for ethical reasons and due to concerns related to the death of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of agents of the Saudi government, one source says. SAMA has declined to comment, and a spokesperson for Pharo, which had about $9.7bn under management as of the end of Janyary, has also declined to comment on the reports.
