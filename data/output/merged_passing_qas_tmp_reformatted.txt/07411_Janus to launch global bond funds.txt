In the next three months, Janus will launch a global high-yield fund and a global investment-grade offering aimed at the foreign market, said Colleen Denzler, head of fixed-income strategy at Janus, to Investment News. In six to nine months, the asset manager will roll out a series of global bond funds for U.S. advisers, she said.
