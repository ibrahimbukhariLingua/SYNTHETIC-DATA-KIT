Change in governance at Sofidy


Sofidy, now controlled by Tikehau Capital, on Tuesday 26 March unveiled a new org chart, following a change in legal format to become a limited-liability company with a board of directors (“société anonyme avec conseil d’administration”), rather than a simplified equity company (“société par actions simplifiée”) with a board of directors and a supervisory board. Guillaume Arnaud, previously CEO of Tikehau IM, is appointed as chairman of the board. He joins Jean-Marc Peter and Jérôme Grumler, CEO and deputy CEO of Sofidy, respectively. The executive body will determine the major strategic direction for the activities of the company, and will be responsible for implementing it. Pierre Vaquier, senior advisor at Tikehau Capital, is appointed as chairman of the supervisory board, while Christian Flamarion, founder of SOFIDY, is now vice-chairman. The supervisory board also includes Henri Marcoux, deputy CEO of Tikehau Capital, Frédéric Jariel, director of real estate activities at Tikehau IM, and Emmanuelle Costa, director of human resources at Tikehau Capital. The non-executive body will oversee the functioning of the business.
