Raiffeisen takes over nearly all of Wegelin bank


Despite its repeated denials, Wegelin has ultimately decided to take drastic action. Growing threats to the situation at Wegelin & Co. private bankers in the United States have led management into a radical decision, to transfer the majority of clients and employees to the private bank Notenstein Private Bank Ltd., which Raiffeisen will acquire in its entirety. The transfer will bring lasting reinforcement to the position of Raiffeisen on the Swiss wealth management market. The sale price has not been disclosed.On 27 January 2012, Wegelin bank thus transferred most of its clients and employees to the private bank Notenstein SA. The transfer allows the bank to withdraw from asset management activities which had previously been conducted internally at the bank, and to combine them with Wegelin Fund Management Ltd in a dedicated entity, 1741 Asset Management SA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Notenstein Private Bank Ltd., the bank says in a statement. The Swiss financial market supervisory authority, Finma, has announced that it will authorise the operation.Wegelin & Co. private bankers will remain active to manage US client contracts to their conclusion, and to participate in talks with the US penal authorities. “As a fully liable party, we will clearly assume our responsibilities,” explains Konrad Hummler, partner and director at the bank. “We wanted to confront the legal debates which await us. But at the same time, we had a duty to offer our clients and employees as much security as possible. All personnel at the bank are unanimous in this position.”
