Raiffeisen CM vaunts merits of Global-Fundamental-Rent fund


Robert Senz, CIO fixed income, and Christian Link manager, have unveiled the Austrian government bond fund Global-Fundamental-Rent (AT0000A0KRS5, distribution shares; AT0000A0KRU1, capitalisation shares; AT0000A0LY69, special distribution shares) to French investors. The fund has seen inflows of about EUR300m in one and a half years in existence, which is one of the best sales results for Raiffeisen Capital Management (RCM), along with the Global Allocation Strategies Plus.Currently, the managers told Newsmanagers, the fund is invested in bonds from 13 developed and emerging countries (out of an eligible universe of 36 countries, with a limit of 16 and a minimum of 8), depending on the ratings awarded to these countries for eight equally-weighted indicators: GDP growth, trade & financial balance, balanced budget, public debt, currency reserves, external debt, corruption index and workforce turnover rate.The largest exposures (12.5%) are for Russia, Norway, and Indonesia, which rank both in the “top 8” and the “top growth” lists. The only euro zone countries are Germany, Austria and Slovakia, with 3.1% each, and the portfolio includes no US or Japanese securities, nor French, Italian or British. However, Switzerland, Sweden, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand weigh in at 9.4% each.Average returns for the portfolio are 3.6% for a duration of 4.9 years, with public debt at 40%, an average growth rate of 4%, a trade surplus of 6%, and a budget deficit of 1% for these countries on average.RCM has seen net inflows of EUR500m abroad (EUR5bn in assets) in the first four months of 2012, and has seen net outflows of EUR500m from horizon funds, due to competition from banking sector bonds being pushed by networks in Austria. Overall (including funds and mandates), RCM has about EUR30bn in assets under management.
