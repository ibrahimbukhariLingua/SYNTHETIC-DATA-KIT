Castlestone Management is launching an emerging markets equities fund dedicated to the “Next 11” group of countries (South Korea, Mexico, Indonesia, Turkey, the Philippines, Egypt, Vietnam, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and Iran). Arrash Zafari, who will manage the fund, says the group of 11 countries as a whole are less dependent on natural resources than the BRIC countries. He says countries where political risks are very high and liquidity may be low (Iran) will carry a weighting of zero. About 65% of the portfolio will consist of the major countries of the group (Mexico, Indonesia, Turkey, and the Philippines). 25% will be dedicated to Egypt, vietnam, Pakistan, and Nigeria. Minimal investment in the fund, which will be open to intermediaries from fourth quarter, will be GBP10,000.
