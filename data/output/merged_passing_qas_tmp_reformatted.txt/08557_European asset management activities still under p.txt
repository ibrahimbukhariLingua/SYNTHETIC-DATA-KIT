European asset management activities still under pressure


The European asset management sector will remain under pressure in 2010 and beyond, due to a need for restructuring and market conditions, Fitch Ratings predicts in a special report published on 4 May. Profits in the sector will not return to their pre-crisis levels in the short term, due to lower growth in assets under management and fewer opportunities to reduce costs. These factors all make the sector more vulnerable to the effects of any new phase of poor market conditions. Profits are lower in the sector, though average operating margins are still in good shape, at 27%, compared with 35% in 2007. The report points to regulatory changes on the horizon (UCITs IV, WIFM, Basel 3, Solvency II), which are a cause for uncertainty in the sector. The first effects of these developments are already apparent in the launch of hedge fund vehicles in OPCVM format and the move to European domiciles of offshore funds. “Changes in the longer term, including Basel 3 and Solvency II, represent a more considerable challenge for the financial industry, which may lead major investors such as banks, insurers and pension funds to pull out of some higher-risk assets,” says Aymeric Poizot, head of the Fund and Asset Manager group for the EMEA region at Fitch.
