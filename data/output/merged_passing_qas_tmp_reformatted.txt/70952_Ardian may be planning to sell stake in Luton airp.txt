Ardian may be planning to sell stake in Luton airport


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } The investment company Ardian has engaged the Rothschild bank to sell its 49% stake in Luton airport, the fifth-largest airport in the United Kingdom, Reuters reports, citing banking sources. Ardian and the Spanish airport operator Aena, who controls the remaining 51%, acquired the site from Albertis in 2013 for EUR508m. Aena has a preferential right to acquire the stake held by Ardian, which will be valued at over USD400m (EUR326m), sources say. At a meeting with analysts this month, the chairman of Aena stated that the Spanish group was not prepared to acquire the stake held by Ardian at any price, and that in the operation it sees an occasion to bring a new financial partner into the capital at Luton.
