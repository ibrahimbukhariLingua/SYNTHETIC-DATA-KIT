Liechtenstein removed from OECD «grey list»


The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has removed Liechtenstein from its “grey list” of countries which refuse to exchange tax information. The OECD is still monitoring 28 countries which, in many cases, have engaged to comply with OECD standards for tax information sharing, but have not yet done so in practice.
