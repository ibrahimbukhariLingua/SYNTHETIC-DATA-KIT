Funds of Newcits hold onto cash


A majority of UCITS-compliant funds of hedge funds (61%) report that they have a structural cash allocation, according to a survey by KdK Asset Management covering 40 managers of funds of hedge funds. 28% of respondents say that the cash allocation is over 8%. Some managers hold on to cash in order to be able to take advantage of short-term opportunities as they arise, KdK AM reports, expressing some surprise at the results. However, other funds retain liquidity in order to meet potential redemption demands form investors, as they estimate that their portfolio of underlying funds is not sufficiently liquid. This is a surprising attitude given the fact that one of the advatnages UCITS funds are supposed to offer is precisely a higher level of liquidity. Regulations require that liquidity be at least bi-monthly. The study finds that 68% of UCITS funds of hedge funds offer weekly liquidity, while 32% offer daily liquidity.
