UBS acquires a multi-family office in Brazil


UBS Group AG agreed to buy a majority stake in Consenso Investimentos Ltd., Brazil’s biggest independent multi-family office, becoming the latest Swiss bank to bet on the industry’s growth, says Bloomberg. “This transaction will allow UBS to accelerate its expansion in Brazil and demonstrates our longstanding commitment to growing our wealth-management business in this key market,” Alejandro Velez, head of Latin America wealth management at Zurich-based UBS, said in an emailed statement. He declined to provide pricing details for the deal, which the company expects to complete around the beginning of the third quarter.
