Regulators need to step up the pace of reforms to OTC derivative markets


The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has called on regulators worldwide to accelerate their efforts to co-ordinate reforms of over-the-counter (OTC) derivative markets. In a progress report published on 1 November, the FSB states that efforts are progressing, particularly in the major markets concerned, but that it would be advisable to intensify efforts on all fronts toward a complete implementation of the reforms called for by the G20.
