Danish pension funds set up an asset management firm


Unipension, a structure controlled by three Danish pension funds, has received approval from the local authorities to set up an asset management firm, Unipension Fondsmæglerselskab A/S, at the end of this year. The new entity will manage the assets of its owners, but will also work with third parties, in order to realise economies of scale. It now represents assets of DKK80bn, or about EUR10.8bn. Unipension Fondsmæglerselskab will be a unit of Unipension, which in turn is owned by the architects’ pension fund (AP), the pension fund for Danish MAs, MScs and PhDs (MP) and the pension fund for agricultural academics and veterinary surgeons (PJD)..
