Syz &amp; Co launches a Latin America fund


The Syz & Co group has launched Oyster LatAm Opportunities, a fund which invests in South American equities, and which will be managed by Moneda Asset Management SA in Chile, a specialist in Latin American investment. The fund will invest in companies of all cap sizes (from a minimum of USD100m in market capitalisation), and will concentrate on 60 to 100 positions throughout Latin America. The fund, which remains reserved for institutional clients, will soon be registered in several European countries, including Switzerland, which will make it possible to distribute the fund to retail clients like other Oyster sub-funds.
