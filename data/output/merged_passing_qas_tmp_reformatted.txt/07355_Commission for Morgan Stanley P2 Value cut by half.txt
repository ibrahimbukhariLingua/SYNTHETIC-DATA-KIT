Commission for Morgan Stanley P2 Value cut by half


As of 6 September, assets in the open-ended real estate fund Morgan Stanley P2 Value totalled EUR922.8m, compared with EUR1.67bn aat the time that redemptions were frozen at the end of October 2008. On Monday evening, the fund announced that a reexamination of the assets in the portfolio resulted in a downward revision of EUR185m, in addition to a EUR21m risk provision. This means that the net asset value (NAV) of the shares has been revised downward by about 18% since 31 August, to EUR29.83, compared with EUR36.48. When the fund reopens to redeptions in early November, it will presumably have a net asset value of EUR26.60 to EUR28.20. The P2 Value fund has increased its liquidity through a sale in the past few weeks of properties in the Netherlands (Hardwareweg and Soesterberg), in France (Arcueil), and in Singapore (Drycott Park). The sales have generated a net total of EUR85m in net proceeds. Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investment GmbH has also announced plans to reduce management commissions for the P2 Value fund by half, to cost, for the three years following the reopening of the fund to redemptions. Currently, the fundâ€™s total expense ratio (TER) is 0.88%. The management firm has also announced that Marc Weinstock is joining the managing board. He was a member of the board at HS Real Estate until June, in charge of funds and participations. Silvia Schmitten-Walgenbach is also joining the board of directors. Since 2007, she has been a member of the management team at DEGI, which has in the meantime been acquired by Aberdeen Property Investors. Morgan Stanley REI states that it is seeking a chief financial officer. The CEO, Walter Klug, 62, who is in charge of strategy, marketing, distribution, and external relations, will be retiring in June 2011.
