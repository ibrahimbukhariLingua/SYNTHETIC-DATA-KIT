Barclays Private Equity becomes Equistone Partners


The Barclays Private Equity fund, a specialist in investment in non-publicly traded businesses, has been taken over by six executives, and will continue to operate in the future under the name Equistone Partners Europe, according to a statement released by the business on 11 November. The financial terms of the transaction have not been disclosed, but Barclays will remain an investor in funds managed by Equistone, “along with many other institutional investors.” The decision is a sign of the increasing disinterest of traditional banks in an activity that consumes capital, at a time when solvency requirements are requiring them to significantly increase their owners’ equity levels. Since 1996, Barclays Private Equity has invested EUR5.3bn in 214 transactions. The fund, which states that its investments have allowed it to earn “excellent returns on behalf of its investors,” is specialised in mid-sized businesses. Equistone operates out of six offices, in France, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, with 35 managers. The fund ia planning to focus on acqusitions with a total value of EUR50m to EUR300m, the statement says.
