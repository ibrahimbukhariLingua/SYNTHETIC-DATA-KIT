Morgan Stanley chief hopes to double assets under management


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } James Gorman, the CEO of Morgan Stanley, has announced during a conference that he wants the asset management unit to join the club of firms with USD1trn under management, Bloomberg reports. The activity had assets of USD469bn as of the end of March. This makes it smaller than the asset management units at its rivals Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co, which each have over USD1trn. Some analysts are asking whether Morgan Stanley should make an acquisition. “As we all know, transactions in this field are complicated, due to problems of culture. But we could fill some gaps,” says Gorman.
