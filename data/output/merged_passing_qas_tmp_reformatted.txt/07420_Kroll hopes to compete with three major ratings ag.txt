Kroll hopes to compete with three major ratings agencies


Les Echos reports that Jules Kroll, 69, the eponymous founder of the economic intelligence group, is hoping to rival Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch, the three major ratings agencies which account for most of the market. “We need a credible alternative,” Kroll tells the Wall Street Journal. The US billionaire founded Kroll Bond Rating Agency last year. He has recently acquired a ratings boutique, Lace Financial, and has recruited several analysts, and is aiming to obtain new licenses and take a bite out of the three major ratings’ agencies, which have been under fire for the past two years.
