European investors reaffirm confidence in euro zone


The ongoing European crisis does not appear to be shaking the confidence of investors in other respects. Most investors in European bonds estimate that the euro zone will survive the pressure on it and pull through in its present form, according to the most recent quarterly survey by the financial ratings agency Fitch Ratings. The survey was conducted between 2 July and 2 August, and covered a sample of managers with cumulative assets of USD7.2trn. Only 5% of investors surveyed predict a large-scale dissolution of the euro zone. 9% of investors predict that there will be a series of sovereign defaults in the euro zone, but estimate that these events will not cause the euro zone to be dismantled, while 21% of investors predict that Greece and one or two other countries may leave the European project. Most predict a fiscal union (33%) or a «muddling through» (31%). The findings of the survey are relatively close to those in October last year, in which only 4% of investors predicted that the euro zone would fall apart. This means that despite the severity of the crisis, investors are thinking of the long term, and remain confident in the future of Europe. Fitch shares this point of view, estimating that a dismantlement of the euro zone is unlikely due to the enormous cost, and the engagement of politicians in favour of the Union. But the crisis has revealed the urgency of increased fiscal, financial and political integration.
