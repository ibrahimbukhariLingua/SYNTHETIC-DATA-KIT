Ahorro Corporación seeking a foreign partner


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In an interview with Cinco Días, Antonio Fernández, CEO of Ahorro Corporación since 15 December 2009, says that the financial arm of the Spanish savings banks has posted an increase of 60-70% to its profits in 2010, bringing them back to 2008 levels. In 2009, profits were limited to EUR8.2m. The manager also says that assets in funds were down 50% in 2008 and 2009, compared with an average of 42% for the sector, while assets at Ahorro Corporación in 2010 fell by less than at its competitors.Fernández also says it is “very reasonable” that Ahorro Corporación should have another shareholder in its structure. The new shareholder could be international, as Ahorro Corporación has a very strong presence in Spain, which could be highly attractive for a financial investor. But that partner would need to add value to Ahorro Corporación, and help it to develop in the sectors of activity that interest it most.
