FSA publishes business plan for 2011-2012


The British financial market regulatory authority (FSA) on 22 March published a roadmap which sets out its priorities for 2011-2012, and their implications on the FSAâ€™s budget. Ahead of its restructuring, slated for late 2012 or early 2013, the FSA plans to participate and contribute to major European regulatory projects underway (Basel III, Solvency II), and to introduce national initiatives to improve consumer protection, including the RDR (Retail Distribution Review).
