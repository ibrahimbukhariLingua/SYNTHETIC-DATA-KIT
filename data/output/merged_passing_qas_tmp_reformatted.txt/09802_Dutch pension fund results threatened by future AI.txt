Dutch pension fund results threatened by future AIFM directive


Les Echos reports that the future European AIFM directive, which is chiefly concerned with hedge funds, at this stage is in danger of cutting into the roughly EUR1.5bn per year of financial revenues for Dutch pension funds. This reduction would trigger a domino effect which could result in a 6% increase in retirement contributions for employees and businesses, the sector calculates. At present, the portfolio of retirement institutions in the Netherlands are 9% compoased of alternative investments. On average, these investments brought returns of about 8.84%, compared with 6.64% for equities or bond markets.
