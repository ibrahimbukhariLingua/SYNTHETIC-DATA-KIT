Pimco responds to Bill Gross


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Pimco has reacted to the lawsuit filed against the company by its former director, Bill Gross, in which he is seeking USD200m, accusing the firm of unfair dismissal. Mike Reid, a spokesperson for the company cited by Reuters, says that Pimco (an affiliate of the German insurer Allianz) argues that the legal action by Gross is “unfounded” and that the legal team at the asset management firm “will respond to the accusations in court” in due course. Janus Capital Group, the current employer of Gross, says that the case is of a private nature and only concerns the two parties.
