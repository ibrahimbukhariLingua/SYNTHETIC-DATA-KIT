CFTC to look into high frequency trading


Scott Oâ€™Malia, a member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is planning to call this Tuesday for the creation of a sub-committee within the Technology Advisory Committee, the Wall Street Journal reports. The sub-committee would be focused on high-frequency trading, and would be chaired by the CFTC chief economist Andrei Kirilenko. The objective for the regulator is to determine how electronic trading affects commodity markets and participants on those markets.
