Threadneedle launches an absolute return fund


The range of absolute return funds from Threadneedle (GBP1.9bn in assets as of the end of June) has been enlarged with the addition of the UK Absolute Alpha Fund, which is managed by Mark Westwood and Chris Kinder, who have previous experience in long/short management. It is a UCITS-compliant fund, which will replicate the formula already used for Cayman Islands-domiciled funds in a UCITS III-compliant environment, in a manner similar to the Threadneedle Enhanced Commodities Fund (TECF) and the Threadneedle (Lux) American Absolute Alpha Fund (see Newsmanagers of 1 July and 25 June, respectively).
