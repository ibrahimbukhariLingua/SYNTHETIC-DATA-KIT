Chilean pension fund regulator marginalises Irish UCITS funds


The Western financial press editorialised considerably over the publication on 1 September in the Chilean official gazette, the Diario Oficial, of a decision by the pension fund regulator, the Comisión Clasificadora de Riesgo (CCR, www.ccr.cl). Following a downgrade of the credit rating for Ireland to the junk category by Moody’s, the CCR has decided to place 135 UCITS-compliant funds domiciled in Ireland on a list of restricted-access investments. This does not mean that pension funds will no longer be allowed to invest in these funds, or that they will have to sell off shares. But investments in these funds are now subject to stricter regulatory constraints.On the six-page list includes a total of 25 issuers, including 33 ETFs from iShares (19 of them equities funds), 14 products from BNY Mellon Global Funds, 12 funds from Pimco, and 12 sub-funds of the SEI Global Master Fund, 11 funds each from Axa Rosenberg Equity Alpha Trust, Invesco Funds, Legg Mason Global Funds and Baring, and eight products from Skandia Global Funds.Three Irish-registered funds from French issuers are also on the list: SPDR Europe Plc - Amundi ETF S&P Europe 350 Fund, the BNP Paribas GLF EUR funds, and BNP Paribas GLF USD from BNP Paribas Global Liquidity plc.
