“Lyxor does not give up synthetic replication”


In an interview with the Börsen-Zeitung, Simon Klein, head of ETF Europe and global head of business development ETF & indexing, says that a recent decision by Lyxor Asset Management to offer physical replication ETFs (see Newsmanagers of 19 November) does not mean that the asset management firm is stopping its offerings of synthetic replication products. Lyxor wants to offer its clients “the best of both worlds.” In addition, physical replication is well-suited to government bond ETFs, which does not mean that Lyxor will choose physical replication for all the bond ETFs it launches. However, Lyxor remains primarily an equity ETF specialist.Klein also says that Lyxor has liquidated five ETFs this year.
