Azimut teams up with Chinese player in wealth management


Azimut has wind in its sails in Asia. The Italian asset management firm has signed an agreement via its Hong Kong affiliate, An Zhong Investment Management Hong Kong, with Youmy Wealth Management, a firm specialised in wealth management in China. The agreement includes “the development of a strategic commercial relationship between Youmy and Azimut Hong Kong, and is based on increasing capital investment in Youmy, subject to permission from the local authorities,” a statement released by Azimut says. Youmy, founded in 2014, has a network of 28 family offices in 15 cities in China. The firm manages traditional asset classes, such as private equity and venture capital. An affiliate of the firm has slightly over RMB1bn in assets under management in this field. “The founders of Youmy are pioneers in the wealth management sector in China, and have profound knowledge of the needs and demands of high net worth clients,” a statement says.
