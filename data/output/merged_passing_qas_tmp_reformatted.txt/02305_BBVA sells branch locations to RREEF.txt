BBVA sells branch locations to RREEF


According to reports in Expansión, the BBVA will sell 80% of its 1,350 branches in Spain, which it decided to sell off a year ago, to RREEF Alternative Investment (a fund from Deutsche Bank), for EUR1.2bn. The operation, which is known internally under the name “Proyecto Árbol,” will be a sale & lease-back deal. The US-based fund Area will be the junior partner of RREEF in the transaction. Expansión states that RREEF may also acquire the remaining 200 branches in the next two to three weeks, for EUR400m, but the financing for these acquisitions has yet to be secured. One of the unique characteristics of the operation is that BBVA will be able, within the overall agreement, to change the branches it occupies depending on the market situation, which would make it possible to restructure the network.
