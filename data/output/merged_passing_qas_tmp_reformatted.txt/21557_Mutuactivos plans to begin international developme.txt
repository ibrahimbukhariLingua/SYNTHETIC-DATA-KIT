Mutuactivos plans to begin international development


The asset management firm Mutuactivos (EUR2.4bn), an affiliate of the insurer Mutua Madrile√±a, has recently obtained a license from the CNMV to offer investment services outside Spain in the European Economic Area, Funds People reports. The permit will allow the asset manager to sell its products abroad without having to open a local affiliate in each country; Mutuactivos may also offer its products to international investors, if it launches funds domiciled in Luxembourg or Ireland.Currently, Mutuactivos manages 41 funds, and 67% of its assets are in bonds. In the past few months, the Spanish asset management firm has awarded mandates to foreign asset management firms, including a mandate for the Mutuafondo Corporate ex Financials, managed by Morgan Stanley IM, and a convertible bond product managed by JPMorgan AM.
