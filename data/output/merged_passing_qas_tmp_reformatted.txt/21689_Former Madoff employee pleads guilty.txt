Former Madoff employee pleads guilty


Craig Kugel, the son of David L. Kugel, a former Madoff trader, has admitted to completing false documents claiming that individuals were on the payroll of the fraudster when they did not work for the company, and of having failed to declare personal spending related to a business credit card as income, the Wall Street Journal reports. These individuals received salary and benefits but were not real employees. Kugel, however, denied any involvement in the fraud.
