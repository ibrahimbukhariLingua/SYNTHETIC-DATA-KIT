SEB launches a forestry fund for Forst Invest


The German affiliate of the Swedish group SEB is launching a Luxembourg-registered specialised investment fund, Forst Invest - Waldfonds S.C.A. SICAV-SIF, which will invest exclusively in forested land located in Germany, for the independent fnancial services provider Deutsche Forst Invest GmbH. SEB will provide administration, accounting, valuation and reporting for the fund, while Forst Invest will manage the fund. The first closing for the institutional product, available with a minimum subscription of EUR0.5m, will take place on 31 October. Revenues for the fund will be generated by sales of wood and appreciation in the value of the land due to the gradual transformation of forested plots of land to multiple types of trees (resinous and deciduous).
