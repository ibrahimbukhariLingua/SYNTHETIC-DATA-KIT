Brexit isrequiring the Swiss private bank to revise its plans. “WithoutBrexit, we would resolutely make London our European base, but thisproject must be postponed,” explains Guy de Picciotto, in aninterview with FTfm. Instead, UBP will place more resources inLuxembourg and in scaling up activities in Italy, Spain and France.“For all of us, access to the market is a determining factor.Unfortunately, Switzerland no longer has access to the Europeanbanking sector,” he continues. “There is a way to increase theclient base through acquisitions, we are certainly studying it,”adds de Picciotto. “If that is not in Switzerland, it willcertainly be in Asia, and we can expect to add to our bank in London,regardless of the outcome of Brexit.” Discussing the hedge fundcrisis, de Picciotto says that “the main changes after the burstingof the hedge fund bubble is that we have started a new activityserving institutionals, with long-only products.” He estiamtes thatthe sales of funds to insurance companies and other banks will be amore lucrative activity than sales to private clients.
