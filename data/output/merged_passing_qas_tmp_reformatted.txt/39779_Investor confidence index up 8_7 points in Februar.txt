Investor confidence index up 8.7 points in February


The State Street Global Investor Confidence Index rose by 8.7 points in February to reach 123.0. The increase was primarily driven by North American institutional investors, with the North American ICI rising 12.3 points to 125.5, up from January’s revised level of 113.2. Risk sentiment was more tepid elsewhere, with the European ICI falling slightly from January’s revised reading of 112.8 to settle at 110.6. Offsetting this was a small increase in confidence among Asian investors, with the Asian ICI rising 3.3 points to 106.6 from the January reading of 103.3.“Weaker US economic data and troubles in emerging markets sparked a dramatic correction in global equities in late January and early February, but longer-term investors did not panic” noted Michael Metcalfe, senior vice president and head of multi-asset strategy, State Street Global Markets. “Instead, they used the sell-off in risk assets as a buying opportunity and measured investor sentiment rose in all regions bar Europe.”
