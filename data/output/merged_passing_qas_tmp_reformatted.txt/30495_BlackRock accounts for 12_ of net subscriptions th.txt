P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Since the Bank of Spain has recommended that financial institutions limit returns on savings accounts, flows have been redirected to investment funds, to the tune of about EUR8bn in first quarter. And, Expansi√≥n reports, BlackRock alone attracted EUR1.192bn, equivalent to 12% of net subscriptions to funds in Spain.This endangers the traditional supremacy of JPMorgan among foreign asset management firms, as BlackRock comes in with EUR6.289bn in assets (of which 55% are in traditional funds and 45% in ETFs) as of the end of March, while JPMorgan AM had EUR6.399bn. BlackRock alone accounted for 38% of the rise in assets under management by foreign firms.The other actors are far behind: assets at La Caixa were up by EUR879m, while Bankinter was up by EUR764m, Allianz Popular by EUR676m, and Santander by EUR556m.
