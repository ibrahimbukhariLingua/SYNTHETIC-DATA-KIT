Image of BRIC countries improves


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } According to the most recent Nations GfK Roper 2010 image survey, which measures the global image of 50 countries, two BRIC countries have made major progress, though they are not yet in the top 10: Brazil and China, which have risen from 21st to 14th place in the export area. The United States is still on top, despite mediocre rankings for some areas such as responsible behaviour for “peace and security” (21st), or responsible environmental protection policy (26th). In the top 10, major changes have taken place, as Spain has fallen out of the top 10. Canada has overtaken Italy, and France has fallen to third place, behind Germany.
