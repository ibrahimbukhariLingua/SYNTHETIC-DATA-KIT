Other European banks named in US tax evasion investigation


The Wall Street Journal reports, citing people familiar with the matter, that wealthy US citizens using a tax-evasion amnesty program have identified about 10 Swiss and European banks where their accounts are held. This opens new fronts in the Internal Revenue Service’s investigation. Among the banks named in the voluntary declarations are Credit Suisse, Julius Baer, Zürcher Kantonalbank and Union Bancaire Privée, the WSJ reveals. The disclosures don’t signal wrongdoing at the banks.
