Fewer hedge funds with more assets, PerTrac study finds


In 2009, the number of hedge funds and funds of hedge funds declined by 8.6%, with a 8.4% decline for single hedge funds and 7.1% for funds of hedge funds. At the same time, assets in the sector increased by 5.5% to USD1.41trn, according to the PerTrac 2009 Hedge Fund Database Study. Nearly 200 funds had assets under management of over USD1bn. Meredith Jones, managing director of PerTrac, says that a decline in the number of funds which release their results for use in the database does not necessarily mean that a corresponding number of funds has shut down, as some are ceasing to share their data due to disappointing results, excessively high results, changes in personnel, hard or soft closes, or other reasons. Among the other major findings of the study, PerTrac states that about 18,450 funds reported their performance in 2009; meanwhile, PerTrac identified about 14,650 single-manager hedge funds and about 7.050 funds of hedge funds in existence, compared with 15,150 and 7,200 in the 2008 study. The study also identified about 5,000 hedge fund management firms. Of the 14,650 single-manager hedge funds, about 12,000 disclosed their results for 2009. Of this subset, about 29% were domiciled in the United States. And of the 6,300 funds of hedge funds which published their results for 2009, about 10% were based in the United States. The number of funds domiciled in the United States fell 3.4%, while funds domiciled outside the US fell by 3%.
