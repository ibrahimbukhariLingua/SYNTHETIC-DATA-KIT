Asset management firms lack flagship funds


In a highly competitive fund distribution market, the weight of a product makes all the difference, Fitch Ratings claims. With at least EUR1bn in assets, flagship funds are what European firms are missing to compete with their Anglo-American rivals, the ratings agency says in a recent study.On the cross-border fund distribution market (excluding money market funds), UK and US asset management firms lead the pack. Among the firms with the strongest concentration of flagship funds, Robeco is the only non-Anglo-American firm. M&G takes first place, with 34% and 11 flagship funds out of 30, followed by Pimco (29%), Vanguard (21%), BlackRock (19%) and Franklin Templeton, with 17% of funds on sale being of flagship size.At the other end of the extreme, Fitch says, European asset management firms have overly wide product ranges, with few or no flagship funds. Of the ten firms with the fewest funds weighing in at over EUR1bn, all are of continental European in origin, except HSBC. Paribas has 469 funds, but only 8 have over EUR1bn in assets.Only in the specialist asset management firm segment do we find flagship funds, on sale from European Firms such as Skagen, Carmignac Gestion, DNCA and Comgest.Having large funds has several advantages, says Fitch. Flagship funds allow for larger operational efficiency in the area of administration and reporting, for example. Managers who manage fewer funds also have less addministrative burden and can concentrate more on management and generating new ideas. Flagship funds are more visible in rankings and advertising, and are more easy to sell via promoters, Fitch notes. Front-end fees for investors may be higher, however.
