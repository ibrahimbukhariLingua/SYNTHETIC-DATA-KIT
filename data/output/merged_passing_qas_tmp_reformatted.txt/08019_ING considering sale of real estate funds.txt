ING considering sale of real estate funds


ING Groep is weighing a sale of its real-estate funds, says the Wall Street Journal. The Dutch financial group said earlier this month it was «conducting an evaluation of the position of ING REIM within the banking business.» Morgan Stanley has been appointed to evaluate ING REIM and could advise the bank on a sale, according to people familiar with the matter. Analysts believe ING could fetch between EUR800 million and EUR1 billion through a direct sale of REIM, which has EUR66.4 billion in property assets under management. Potential investors are coming forward, including AXA Real Estate Investment Managers.
