Global index provider Dow Jones Indexes today announced the launch of the Dow Jones UAE 25 Index, which reflects the performance of the 25 largest and most liquid shares traded in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Dow Jones UAE 25 Index will also form the basis for the first ETF in the United Arab Emirates, from the National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD). The Dow Jones NBAD OneShare UAE 25 ETF will be listed on the Abu Dhabi stock exchange at the end of March. At the end of February, the five largest shares in the index by the volume of publicly traded capital (float) were Emirates Telecommunications Corp, First Gulf Bank PJSC, Emaar Properties PJSC, the National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC and Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC. The percentage of total capital represented by each share by traded volume is limited to 8% of the index, while companies which represent 5% or more of the index must together make up no more than 40% of the total index.
