Ireland - Ethical committee to consider NPRF policies


The Irish finance minister, Brian Lenihan, has announced that the lower chamber of Parliament (Dáil Éireann) will soon found an inter-ministerial commission to study the possibility of establishing ethical investment directives for the National Pension Reserve Fund (NPRF), IPE reports. When the national pension fund was founded in 2001, it was decided that an ethical investment policy would not be appropriate or practical since it would be restrictive. But opinions have changed since, and the MPRF commission has introduced several environmental, social and governance (ESG) guidelines into the management of the fund.
