Investors are asking whether the personnel problems may slow the capacity of Pimco to confront an increasingly difficult environment for bonds. Some feel that Allianz may intervene to control Pimco more in the wake of the departure of El-Erian. Pimco contributes 30% to the operating profits of Allianz.
