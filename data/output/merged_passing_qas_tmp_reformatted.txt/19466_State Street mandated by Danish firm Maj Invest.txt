State Street mandated by Danish firm Maj Invest


State Street Corporation on 25 September announced that it will be providing securities custody, transfer agency and fund administration services in Luxembourg to the sinAI fund, a long/short equity strategy fund which has recently been launched by the Danish firm Maj Invest. The sinAI fund (stock market investment by artificial intelligence), launched in June in Luxembourg in the form of a SICAV, currently has USD215m in assets under management. All investments in the fund are made by an exclusive and sophisticated artificial intelligence system which selects long and short positions on the US equity market. The system then classifies potential opportunities depending on their risk/return profile.
