European Commission recommends that financial surveillance be increased


The European Commission suggests in a statement published on Wednesday that the current architecture of regulatory authorities in charge of surveillance of financial services is ripe for radical reform. The changes would include the creation of a European Council for Systemic Risk (CERS) and a European Financial Surveillance System (SESF), composed of new European supervision authorities in charge of the banking, insurance/professional pensions and securities markets sectors. The European Commission invites all interested parties to submit their reactions in writing by 15 July at the latest. The president of the Commission, Jos√© Manuel Barroso, would like to see the new architecture operational by next year.
