FSA plans to enforce rules for absolute return funds


The British Financial Services Authority (FSA) is planning to require of fund managers that information on absolute return funds contain warnings about the risks related to these funds, when their presentation implies that there are guaranteed returns or protection of capital, even though this is not necessarily the case.In its most recent quarterly consultation, published just before the weekend, the FSA announces that it would like to introduce additional information on absolute return and total return funds. “We have already in the past presented absolute return funds as a subject of potential concern, pointing out that clients may interpret the terms ‘absolute return’ and ‘total return’ as a guarantee of positive returns on their investments. We would like it to be absolutely clear to investors that their capital is at risk in these funds,” the FSA states.
