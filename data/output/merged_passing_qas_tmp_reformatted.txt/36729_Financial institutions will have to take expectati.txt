Financial institutions will have to take expectations of younger generations into account


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } “Many financial institutions may miss out on opportunities which await them when the baby boom generation passes on its assets to clients in the next generation. They may also see a significant decline in their wealth management activities, as they take on the position of adviser and manager to high net worth individuals and families.” Drawing on the conclusions of the latest white paper published by the global financial institute at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management, the study identifies the differences between the children of the baby boomers, now aged 30 to 45 (Generation X), and those who were born in the information age, aged from 15 to 30 (Generation Y). Ignoring their needs and doing nothing to move in their direction represents one of the greatest dangers for financial institutions, particularly when the populations concerned will inherit trillions of euros in the next 15 years. The persons concerned are characterised by radically different ideas with respect to transparency and the spontaneity of relationships with financial institutions, the study finds. In the future, it recommends, personal contact in the form of meetings, which now predominate, will be replaced by virtual channels of communication. Then, the study predicts, “multimedia solutions will create a means for them to hold meetings with their adviser in a totally new way.”
