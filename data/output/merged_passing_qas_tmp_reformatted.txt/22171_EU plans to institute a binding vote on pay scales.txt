EU plans to institute a binding vote on pay scales


The European commissionner in charge of internal market and services would like to give more power to shareholders in European publicly-traded companies. In an interview with the Financial Times, Michel Barnier says that he would like to introduce a binding vote on pay scales, and a way for shareholders to set a limit on bonuses. Investors in banks would be able to limit “morally indefensible” pay scales, and the difference between the lowest and the highest salaries would be limited. Banks would also be required to disclose the earnings of the 20 to 30 highest paid.
