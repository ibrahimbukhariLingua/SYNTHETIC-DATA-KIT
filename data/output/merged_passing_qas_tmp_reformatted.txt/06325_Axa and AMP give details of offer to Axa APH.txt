The independent directors of AXA APH are studying the offer, the statement notes, adding that the proposal will be subject to finalisation of due diligence by AMP and an agreement between AMP, AXA APH and AXA abou thte final legal documentation, “which the parties will work to finalise as soon as possible.” If a final agreement and a deal are announced, a “scheme of arrangement” would be set up, which would require the approval of minority shareholders in AXA APH1, and which would be subject to the usual conditions, including a requirement that the approval of the relevant Australian and Asian regulators be obtained. Under the offer, shareholders in AXA APH would receive the equivalent of AUD6.43 per share, in cash and AMP shares, as well as the final 2010 dividend from AXA APH of 9.25 Australian cents per share (pending the announcement of such a dividend by AXA APH).

Minority shareholders in AXA APH would also earn 50% of any post-scheme VWAP above AUD5.60.
