Jean-Charles Mériaux to remain a major shareholder in DNCA Finance


Following an article in Les Echos on 6 April announcing that Banca Leonardo may soon sell its asset management unit in France, and speculation in Il Corriere della Sera that an investment fund had made a bid to acquire DNCA Finance, the French asset management firm based in rue de la Paix in Paris has confirmed that changes in its ownership are under consideration, but that no decisions had been taken. According to information obtained by Newsmanagers, regardless of the solution chosen, Jean-Charles Mériaux, head of investment, will remain the main shareholder behind the largest institutional shareholder. Currently, the star manager owns 20% of shares, behind Banca Leonardo (67%). In the new distribution of capital now taking shape, the Italian firm would also remain a significant shareholder. An announcement on the subject of the various changes is expected in the next few weeks.
