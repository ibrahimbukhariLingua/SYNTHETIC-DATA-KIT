Madoffâ€™s accountant seeks plea bargain


The only individual besides Bernard Madoff to be charged with criminal offenses over the Madoff scandal, the accountant David Friehling, who signed off on year after year of fraudulent accounts, on Friday pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud under securities laws and disclosure to false information to the SEC. However, he declined to have his case heard by a grand jury, which suggests that he may be disposed to seek an out-of-court settlement with the prosecutor, the Sunday Times reports. On Friday, the judge set the date for the next hearings on 1 October, which gives the parties time to reach any potential agreements.
