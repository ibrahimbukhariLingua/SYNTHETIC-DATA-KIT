Bankia outsources real estate management and sells it to Cerberus


Real estate management operations at Bankia, which had previously been provided by its affiliate Habitat, will be sold for a total of at least EUR40m, and at most EUR90m to the US private equity firm Cerberus, according to a filing to the CNMV cited by Cinco Días. Habitat has real estate assets under management of EUR12bn, and Cerberus will also inherit EUR36.6bn in Bankia real estate assets under management, which have been transferred to the “bad bank” Sareb. Real estate properties in the strict sense will remain the property of Bankia.The transaction allows Bankia to transfer a total of 457 personnel to Cerberus, and thus to achieve a part of its plan to cut 4,500 jobs.
