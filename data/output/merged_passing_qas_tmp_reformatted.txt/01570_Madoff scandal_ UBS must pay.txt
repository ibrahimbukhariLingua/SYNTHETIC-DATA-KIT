Madoff scandal: UBS must pay


An investigative report by La Tribune, published on 9 November, reveals that UBS could not have been unaware that Bernard Madoff was meaningfully involved in the management of the Sicav Luxalpha American Selection and US Equity Plus funds, as revealed in an “operating memorandum” from the US Equity Plus fund, in which Madoff’s name appeared more than 20 times. In this document, UBS named Madoff as sub-depository of the fund and guardian of its assets. But, as the CSSF found in January of this year, this management subcontract does not absolve UBS of its repsonsibilities as depository. If the information in the prospectus was inaccurate, then the bank would be open to charges of fraud, which could mean a criminal case and a nullification of the agreement. UBS Fund Services Luxembourg (UBSFSL) failed to fulfil its duties as the evaluator of the fund, by accepting falsified documents edited by Madoff to calculate the valuations which were then communicated to investors. The net asset value of the fund is now zero. As a result, as circular 2002/77, dated 27 November 2002, from the Luxembourg regulator (CSSF) indicates, UBSFSL is now obligated to reimburse investors for the difference between the overvalued net asset value applied to the fund shares subscribed to and the recalculated net asset value (which is now equal to zero). The circular also defines the responsibilities of the depository in cases when failure to observe investment regulations results in a loss. In this case, page 20 of the operating memorandum states that and investors or funds who experience a loss will be reimbursed by the party at fault, “in principle the portfolio manager,” which would mean UBS Third Party Management. If this entity fails to pay, the fund promoter is liable to do so in its place. Responsibility may also fall back on the manager - and the promoter is none other than UBS AG, La Tribune concludes.
