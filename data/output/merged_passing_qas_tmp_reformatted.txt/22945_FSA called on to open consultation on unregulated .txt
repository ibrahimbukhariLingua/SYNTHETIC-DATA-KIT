FSA called on to open consultation on unregulated collective investment vehicles


The British financial services authority (FSA) should launch an emergency consultation on unregulated collective invetment vehicles (UCIS) used by financial advisers, the financial services specialist consulting firm Aim Two Three claims, Investment Europe reports. The regulator already noted in a previous consultation that these vehicles should be limited to a very restricted set of retail investors due to their high risk levels. If this is the case, Aim Two Three claims, these vehicles should be removed from the list of retail investment products.
