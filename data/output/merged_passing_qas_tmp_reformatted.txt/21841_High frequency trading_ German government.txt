High frequency trading: German government


The BÃ¶rsen-Zeitung has obtained a copy of proposed legislation to govern high frequency trading, which the German federal finance ministry has completed much earlier than expected. The proposals would require high-frequency traders to register with BaFin, and would subject them to banking and securities laws. In addition, BaFin would have the power to demand information including details of algorithmic trades and the systems used as well as their strategies, parameters and trading limits. The proposals could be passed by the Cabinet and put before Parliament for a first debate even before the summer break.
