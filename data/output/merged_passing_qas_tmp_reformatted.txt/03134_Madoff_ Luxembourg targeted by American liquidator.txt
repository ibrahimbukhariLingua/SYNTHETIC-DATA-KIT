Madoff: Luxembourg targeted by American liquidator


According to Les Echos, the US receiver of Madoff’s assets, Irving Picard, is seeking to recuperate money withdrawn by funds and investors in the weeks preceding the broker’s arrest. He is said to have sent the liquidators of the Luxalpha Sicav a statement indicating that Luxalpha must return USD535m, corresponding to all withdrawals during autumn 2008. To defend his interests in Luxembourg, he has retained the law firm Schiltz & Schiltz. The Swiss firm UBS, depository for Luxalpha, is clearly facing a risk of legal action, and is already under pressure from French investors, who are filing a growing number of suits in Luxembourg demanding to be reimbursed.
