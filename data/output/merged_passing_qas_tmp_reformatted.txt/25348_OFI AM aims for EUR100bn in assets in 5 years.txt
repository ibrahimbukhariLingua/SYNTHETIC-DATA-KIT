OFI AM aims for EUR100bn in assets in 5 years


At a time when it is about to merge with Macif Gestion and OFI Mandats, OFI AM has announced that it is aiming for EUR100bn in assets in five years’ ime, virtually double the EUR56.2bn it manages currently.To achieve that, the firm is planning to develop serving clients outside the group, particularly international distributors. This proportion of clients, which currently represents 20% of total assets, is expected to increase to 30% in five years, “or about EUR20bn more in assets than currently,” says Gérard Bourret, CEO of OFI AM. At the same time, assets under management for the group are expected to fall from 50% to 35%, while the remainder will come from “strategic partners.”In order to win over these new external clients, the asset management firm will rely on its funds, which now represent 32% of assets, but which pay better than mandates. In order to simplify and be as legible as possible, OFI AM will focus only a restricted range of about 18 funds. This range will include the best-performing and largest funds (in total, they represent about EUR8bn).Meanwhile, in 2013, OFI AM has posted net inflows of EUR680m to mandates and EUR600m to funds, for total inflows of EUR1.28bn.
