Hansainvest brings together green technologies and private equity


With its new offering, SI Ökoselect-Fonds, launched on 2 June, 2009, Hanseatische Investment (Hansainvest) presents an environmental technologies fund (renewable energy, water treatment and infrastructure, energy efficiency, pollution reduction, etc), whose portfolio will initially consist of 10% to 15% private equity, though it may invest up to 20% in this asset class. The new fund, registered in Germany, is advised by Olaf Köster, director of fund management at VCH Inevstment Group, an affiliate of Altira Group. Minimal subscription is set at EUR50. The new fund will be managed with a bottom-up approach and will initially select shares on the basis of their potential for growth, and will then filter the results based on environmental and social exclusionary criteria. This sustainable development overlay will allow the product to avoid businesses whose corporate governance is not convincingly resopnsible, as well as companies in the nuclear energy, gambling, prostitution and weapons trades. The manager will then analyse the sectoral outlooks and attempt to limit or hedge currency risks.
