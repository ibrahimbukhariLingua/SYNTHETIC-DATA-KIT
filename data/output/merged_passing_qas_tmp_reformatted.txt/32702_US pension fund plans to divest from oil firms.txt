US pension fund plans to divest from oil firms


The pension fund Seattle City Employeesâ€™ Retirement System, with USD2bn in assets, will on Thursday discuss a request from Miek McGinn, mayor of the city, to sell its stakes in major oil firms, due to the threat they pose in terms of climate change, the Financial Times reports. The firms in question are ExxonMobil and Chevron. If the fund were to wholly sell off its stakes in those businesses, it would be the first to do so.
