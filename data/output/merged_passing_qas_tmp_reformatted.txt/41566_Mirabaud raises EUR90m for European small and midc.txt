Mirabaud raises EUR90m for European small and midcaps


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Mirabaud Asset Management has raised over EUR90m for its new European Small and Mid Cap strategy. Two funds for small and midcaps (one pan-European and one Europe ex UK) were launched in early November, following the arrival of Ken Nicholson from Standard Life Investments in August 2015. The management team feels that the potential for this strategy is about EUR1bn. “We intend to reach this figure in the coming years, while privileging our main objective: generating returns for our clients,” says Nicholson.
