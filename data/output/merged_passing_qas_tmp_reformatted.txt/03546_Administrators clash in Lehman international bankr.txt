Administrators clash in Lehman international bankruptcy proceedings


In the United States, the administrators appointed to liquidate Lehman Brothers are planning to ask the courts this Tuesday to approve an international program to co-ordinate the bankruptcy proceedings for its affiliates worldwide. But, the Wall Street Journal reports, their counterparts in the United Kingdom are hostile to these arrangements, both because they are subject to different laws, and because the interests of their creditors are different. The disagreement takes on added significance due to the fact that Lehmanâ€™s UK affiliate possesses data about several other (smaller) companies controlled by the firm in Europe. However, legal administrators in Hong Kong, Singapore, Luxembourg, Germany, and Australia have signed the global protocol.
