Credit strategies in the age of alpha


Credit investment strategies will need to adapt to less direectional credit markets, and exploit carry and relative value potential, while managing duration and liquidity risks, the financial ratings agency Fitch Ratings finds in a new study published on 4 February. In this environment, flexibility will need to occupy a more important place for investors, including fund selectors, the agency claims. “After four years of significant compression of returns and massive inflows, an increasing level of repricing risks has been observed for nominal returns and withdrawals of liquidity,” says Manuel Arrive, senior director in the Fund and Asset Manager team at Fitch. “As a result, funds which offer flexibility in the allocation of risks (to manage beta) and selectivity (to generate alpha) both over the long and short term will need to gain traction.” The soveregn component of credit returns are at all-time highs, while the spread component is at or slightly below long-term levels (16 years) of 135 basis points, and 630 basis points for the high yield and investment grade categories. This leaves traditional long-duration credit portfolios more exposed to an increase in nominal interest rates than credit spreads.
