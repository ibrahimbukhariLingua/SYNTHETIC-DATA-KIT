Liontrust AM acquires Occam AM fund management


Liontrust Asset Management, which manages GBP 1.3bn (as of 14 June 2011), has reached an agreement to acquire the fund management business of Occam Asset Management, which has GBP124m assets under management. This achieves Liontrust’s publicly stated objective of expanding into the fast growing Asia and Emerging Markets asset classes to complement its existing UK and Europe fund management capability. Occam brings the management of four Dublin-based funds - Occam Emerging Markets Opportunities, Occam Asia Focus, Occam Asia Absolute Return and Occam Europe Focus funds - and two Cayman Islands-domiciled hedge funds – Occam Sorbus and Occam Diversity funds - to Liontrust. The Occam Asia Focus and Occam Asia Absolute Return funds are managed by Mark Williams while Eoghan Flanagan and James Mellersh, who were previously working at Thames River Nevsky, manage the Occam Emerging Markets Opportunities fund. Liontrust’s James Inglis-Jones and Gary West take over as fund managers of the Occam Sorbus and Occam Europe Focus funds. Occam also brings an established distribution capability in continental Europe, the Middle East and other international markets to supplement Liontrust’s traditional focus on UK-based investors.
