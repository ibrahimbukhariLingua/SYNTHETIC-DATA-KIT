CNMV ranks funds with performace objectives as complex products


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Pressure is rising in Spain on funds with performance objectives. The local regulator, the CNMV, has announced plans to classify these vehicles into the complex product category, Funds People reports. “We are going to classify structured investment products as complex products. This group includes funds which have an objective concerning returns,” Elvira Rodriguez, chairwoman of the CNMV, announced at an award ceremony. This is a blow to the fund, which since the beginning of the year have been doing well, and are at the centre of sales campaigns from several operators. “Until now, these funds were not considered complex products. But with this change, opportunity tests will have to be applied to them for clients who have access to these products,” Rodriguez explains, adding that “the replacement of guaranteed funds with products with return objectives represents a risk, and that is the reason that the Commission wanted to work on this point.”
