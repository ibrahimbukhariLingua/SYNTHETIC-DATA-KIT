Sparinvest leaves Denmark for Luxembourg


The Danish Asset Manager, Sparinvest SA, has transferred the domicile of its parent company, Sparinvest Holdings SE from Denmark to Luxembourg.Per Noesgaard, CEO of the asset manager, explains the move: «We have now operated out of Luxembourg for exactly a decade and it has become increasingly obvious that this is the ‘intelligent’ domicile for an asset management company with long-term international ambitions. In saying this, we acknowledge the fact that the Authorities overseeing the fund management business here in Luxembourg are the best in the world. Their competence and desire to nurture the fund management industry have proved an irresistible attraction."He adds: «our vision for Sparinvest over the next five years is one of increasing international expansion».In July of this year, Sparinvest became one of the first management companies to achieve UCITS IV authorisation from the Luxembourg legal authority, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF). In September of this year, the fund vehicle Sparinvest SICAV was also declared UCITS IV compliant.
