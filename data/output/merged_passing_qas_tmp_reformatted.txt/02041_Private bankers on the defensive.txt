Private bankers on the defensive


Major actors in wealth management are meeting in Singapore to consider the future of their industry, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. Chris Meares, CEO of HSBC Private Banking, says 60% of client assets are in cash or in liquid accounts, compared with 35% in 2006; clients are gradually beginning to become interested in assets other than bonds, such as equities and simple structured products. The sector is also expecting strong growth in Asia, particularly in Hong Kong and Singapore, where the number of high net worth clients (more than USD5m in assets) and ultra high net worth clients (over USD100m) are rising at 13% per year, compared with 8% in the rest of the world. However, Daniel Truchi, head of SG Private Banking, notes that clients are increasingly inclined to sue their banks, which necessitates reserves to be set aside and cuts into margins. Meanwhile, some clients in Hong Kong, for instance, are willing to take enormous risks, and banks sometimes need to reason with them, in order to avoid having trouble later.
