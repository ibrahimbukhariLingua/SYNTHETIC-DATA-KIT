Carlyle nearing deal to buy StandardAero for more than USD5 bln


Private equity firm Carlyle Group LP is nearing a deal to acquire aviation services company StandardAero from Veritas Capital, another buyout firm, for more than $5 billion, including debt, people familiar with the matter said to Reuters. The deal, which could be announced as early as this week, would come three years after Veritas acquired StandardAero from Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd (DAE) for $2.1 billion, including debt. The StandardAero deal would be Carlyle’s second major leveraged buyout this year. It acquired Akzo Nobel’s chemicals business for 10.1 billion euros ($11.5 billion) in October. StandardAero, headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, provides maintenance, repair and overhaul services to the commercial, business, military and general aviation industries.
