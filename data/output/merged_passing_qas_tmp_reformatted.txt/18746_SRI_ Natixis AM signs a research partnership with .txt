SRI: Natixis AM signs a research partnership with Cambridge


Natixis Asset Management (Natixis AM) on 24 October announced that it has signed a research agreement with the Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership (CPSL) to promote sustainable investment and to encourage adoption of more responsible bahaviour by finance professionals in Europe and internationally. The partnership will have two levels. The first will be an active collaboration based on research, with nine joint publications over the next three years. These reports will analyse sustainable development challenges: how climate change is taken into account, how biodiversity and human rights can affect current business models and promote the generation of investment ideas. Analysts at Natixis AM and Cambridge academics will work together on concrete problems to formulate recommendations for sustainable investment. The reports will be made public in order to encourage the adoption of better practices. The second level of collaboration will take the form of a working group entitled Investors Leaders Group, based at CPSL, and led by Philippe Zaouati, deputy CEO and head of the responsible investment expertise unit at Natixis AM. The group, composed of directors and financial market experts, will meet for the first time next year. The objective will be to work to define concrete tools and measures to adopt to promote and deploy responsible investment.
