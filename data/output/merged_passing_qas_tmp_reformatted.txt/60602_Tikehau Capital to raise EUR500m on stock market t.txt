Tikehau Capital to raise EUR500m on stock market to accelerate growth


Tikehau Capital is giving itself more maneuvering room to finance its development and accelerate its growth. The asset management group, listed on Euronext Paris since March 2017, has announced plans to increase its capital open to all shareholders “by a minimum” of EUR500m. “Depending on the appetite of investors, we may increase the size of the operation,” says Antoine Flamarion, co-founder of Tikehau Capital, at a press conference. “We have already received some commitments from our current shareholders.” The management of the firm, with a 38.1% stake in capital, will subscribe for at least EUR165m as part of this capital increase. “This quota may change depending on the size of the operation,” Flamarion adds. The idea is to dilute the stake as little as possible. “The details of the operation, which will take place at a price of EUR22 per share, will officially be release at the end of next week after the prospectus is approved by the financial market authority (Autorité des marchés financiers, AMF). Subject to this permission, “subscriptions will begin in early July, with the objective of completing the operation by the end of July,” Flamarion says. The capital increase will aim to extend the international investor base. “One of our major challenges is to develop internationally,” admits Flamarion. “77% of our managed capital now comes from French investors.” The firm already has six offices abroad, and about 30% of its 170 partners and employees are based internationally. “In 18 months, we have seen EUR600m in inflows in Italy, where we have opened an office in Milan,” says Flamarion. Internationalisation is clearly expected to accelerate. As recruitments take place, “we are in fairly advanced talks with international personalities in the financial services sector,” says Flamarion.
