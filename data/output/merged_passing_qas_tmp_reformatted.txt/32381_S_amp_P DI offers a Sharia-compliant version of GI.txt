S&amp;P DI offers a Sharia-compliant version of GIVI indices


S&P Dow Jones Indices reports that the range of S&P GIVIâ„¢ Shariah Indices which it is currently launching will be the first family of Sharia-compliant indices which combine low volatility and an alternative weighting schema, depending on the intrinsic value of the shares, rather than their capitalisation size.The first five Sharia-compliant indices, S&P GIVI Developed Shariah Index, S&P GIVI Emerging Shariah Index, S&P GIVI Europe Shariah Index, S&P GIVI Pan Asia Shariah Index et S&P GIVI United States Shariah Index, apply Sharia compatibility filters to shares from the S&P GIVI universe.
