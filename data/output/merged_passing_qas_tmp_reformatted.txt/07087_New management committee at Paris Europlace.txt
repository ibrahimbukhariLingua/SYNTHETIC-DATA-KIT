New management committee at Paris Europlace


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Paris Europlace, which has sought to extend its governance structures to a new generation of actors on the financial markets, on 27 September held the first meeting of its new Management Committee, chaired by Vivien Levy-Garboua, advisor to the chairman of BNP Paribas. The Management Committee will become a central organ, alongside the newly-created colleges of Businesses and Investors. It has redefined its missions in light of the work accomplished in the past year, and has set a new strategic objective, as France prepares to take over presidency of the G20. The missions defined by the new Management Committee are focused on three areas: aligning the visions of market actors (investors, issuers, bankers, cities and regions, and regulators) around a shared project and a collective dynamic, federating and coordinating market projects, and being a presence in proposals to the Paris Europlace Orientation Council and the High Market Committee (HCP). “Our strategy for this renewed and youthful committee is to put the Paris market and the financial power of the Euro zone at the service of economic actors and collective platforms. It is a good sign that the major market actors, such as Banco Santander, Commerzbank, Eurazeo, Goldman Sachs, Saint Gobain, … have joined Paris Europlace, confirming the vitality and necessity of its collective action,” Levy-Garboua says in a statement dated 28 September. The new members of the Management Committee are:- Stéphane Austry, legal partner, CMS Francis Lefebvre- Frédéric Bedin, president, Croissance Plus- Dominique Cerruti, deputy CEO, Nyse Euronext- Fabrice Demarigny, partner, Mazars- Sylvain de Forges, deputy CEO, AG2R- Stéphane Pallez, deputy CFO, France Telecom- Gilles Saint-Marc, lawyer, Gide Loyrette Nouel- Hervé Schricke, vice president, Association Française des Investisseurs en Capital (Afic)
