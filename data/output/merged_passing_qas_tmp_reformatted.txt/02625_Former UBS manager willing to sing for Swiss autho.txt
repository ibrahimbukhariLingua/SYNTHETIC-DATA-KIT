Former UBS manager willing to sing for Swiss authorities also


Bradley Birkenfeld, the former UBS manager whose statements to the United States tax authorities brought to light the tax evasion methods used by UBS in the United States since 2001, would like to inform to the Zurich federal prosecutors also, the Swiss newspaper Le Temps reports. The move comes as part of an investigation into the responsibilities of high-ranking executives at the bank. The former manager claims high-ranking directors at the bank, “driven by blind arrogance and an ultimately suicidal sense of impunity, planned and put into execution a large-scale fraud which allowed the cream of US taxpayers to escape the tax authorities in their country.” In his opinion, these directors are responsible for killing off banking secrecy, and in particular, Peter Kurer, general counsel, Raoul Weil, former head of wealth management, and Martin Liechti, head of the Americas region. Birkenfeld, who has been under house arrest for fifteen months in Boston, will be tried today, Friday, 21 August, before a Florida court. He faces a prison sentence of up to 30 months without parole.
