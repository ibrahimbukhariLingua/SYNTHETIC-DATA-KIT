Guaranteed funds account for more than one quarter of Spanish market


In two years, guaranteed funds in Spain have taken on more than EUR10bn, and have doubled their market share to 26.6% from 13.4%, Expansi√≥n reports. They have dethroned short-duration bond funds as the largest category of funds by asset volume, with EUR34.4bn in assets under management.This total may increase further, as some products are generating returns of over 4% per year due to the debt crisis. But that is a double-edged sword, since these funds hold EUR25bn in Greek, Spanish and Italian public debt.The strongest inflows for guaranteed products have been for InverCaixa, with net subscriptions of EUR3.5bn since the beginning of this year, following EUR2bn in 2010, while in second, third and fourth place are Santander (EUR1.15bn), Bankia (EUR750m) and Banca Civica (EUR400m).
