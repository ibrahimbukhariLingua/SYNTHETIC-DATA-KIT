British asset managers and AFME look to improve transparency of transactions


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The British professional association for managers, the Investment Association (IA), and the banking association, the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), have created a new code of conduct with brokers, so that the largest equity transactions can be executed at the best price possible. With this new working method, bloc transactions should be rendered possible with a more predictable market impact. The code of conduct deals in particular with Indications of Interest (IOI), which are used by brokers to express a desire to buy or sell equities at a given price. The new code will distinguish between two categories of expressions of interest: firstly, IOIs which can be satisfied immediately, without market impact, which will be classed as “Client Natural,” while those which may involve information leaks and market impact will be qualified “Potential.” Bloomberg, one of the largest players in the delivery of IOIs, has engaged to adopt this categorisation, so that market participants can easily identify what type of communication they have attracted. This new framework “will limit potentially misleading market noise, and will allow asset managers to see where the liquidity really is, in order to obtain the best price for the benefit of their clients,” says Daniel Godfrey, CEO of IA, cited in a statement.
