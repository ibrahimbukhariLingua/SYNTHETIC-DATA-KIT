Credit Suisse bets on HNW segment


Credit Suisse would like to stimulate growth in its activities, reshuffling its Private Banking and Wealth Management units. The two heads of the division, enthroned one year ago, Hans-Ulrich Meister and Robert Shafir, are bettig on emerging countries and ultra-high net worth clients, and are planning to get rid of the smaller clients. At this time, private banks are in a delicate situation, Meister says in an interview published on 19 November by the Reuters press agency. “But as soon as rates rise and client activity accelerates, we will have enormous potential.” In the past few months, Credit Suisse has done it with a savings programme for several billions of francs. But opportunities for growth have often been ignored, says Meister. Credit Suisse is aiming for emerging market entrepreneurs. The Ultra High Net Worth Individuals (UHNWI) segment, starting from USD50m invested with the Swiss firm, currently represents 44% of the CHF812bn under management by the private bank.
