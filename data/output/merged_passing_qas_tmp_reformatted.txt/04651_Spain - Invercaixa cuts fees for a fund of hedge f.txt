Spain - Invercaixa cuts fees for a fund of hedge funds


So far, hedge fund managers in Spain have reacted to the crisis either by liquidating their funds, or by freezing redemptions. Invercaixa (La Caixa) has chosen a third way with its fund of hedge funds Invercaixa Privada Estrategia: from Thursday, 26 February, it is lowering management commissions to 0.25% from 0.75%, and cancelling a 10% performance commission, Funds People reports. It is true that the product has posted a 50% loss for January-november 2008. Specialists say such financial conditions are not sustainable for the manager, since funds of hedge funds are costly products.
