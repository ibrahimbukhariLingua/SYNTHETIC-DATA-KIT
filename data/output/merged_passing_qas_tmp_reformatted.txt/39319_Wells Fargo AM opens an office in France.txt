Wells Fargo AM has already EUR2 billion of assets under management in France - out of USD487bn globally and USD30-35bn internationally. «As Europe’s largest market for investment funds, France has always been an important destination for Wells Fargo Asset Management,» notes Ludger Peters, managing director, international business development, at Wells Fargo Asset Management. «For almost 10 years we have successfully managed assets for global financial institutions based in France; in fact, our largest international client is a French business. We also registered our UCITS IV-compliant Luxembourg funds in France in January 2013, making our investment strategies available to retail investors in France."The registration of the funds in France coincided with the arrival of Alexandre Dussaucy at Wells Fargo AM in London to cover French speaking countries. He is now responsible for business development and sales throughout France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Monaco and French–speaking Switzerland and will focus on expanding the institutional and wholesale client base and creating sub-advisory opportunities.This French office is Wells Fargo AM’s first office in continental Europe, but it might not be the last. Asked about other offices openings, a spokesperson for the asset management company answered: «we believe it vital for our success in Europe to have an on-the-ground presence in all of the countries we serve.»
