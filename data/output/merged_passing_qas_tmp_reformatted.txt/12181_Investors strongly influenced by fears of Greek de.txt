Investors strongly influenced by fears of Greek default in mid-September


In the week to 14 September, it was clearly fears of a Greek default which motivated investorsâ€™ decisions. Redemptions from European equity and bond funds reached a five-week high, according to statistics from EPFR Global.Equity funds overall, however, posted a net inflow of USD9bn. It is true that US equity funds saw their largest inflow since mid-June 2008, but only due to a single tracker fund, which saw inflows of over USD12bn in the week. However, excluding this singular inflow, redemptions from actively-managed funds were more or less offset by subscriptions to passive funds.In Europe, equity funds were hit hard by the rise in rates for Greek and Italian debt. Redemptions in the week meant that for the first time since the beginning of the year funds show a net outflow for the year as a whole to mid-September, with redemptions to retail clients cancelling out engagements from institutional clients to German equity funds.Bond funds, largely due to investor interest in emerging and US markets, finished the week under review with a net inflow of USD2.62bn. However, money market funds, after several week of significant subscriptions, saw net redemptions of USD16.7bn due to questions about the role of short-term credit in the financing policies of European banks.
