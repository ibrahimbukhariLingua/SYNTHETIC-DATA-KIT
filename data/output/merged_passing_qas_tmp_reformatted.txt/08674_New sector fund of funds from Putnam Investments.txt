New sector fund of funds from Putnam Investments


Mutual Fund Wire reports that Putnam Investments on Monday 19 April launched the Putnam Global Sector Fund, an actively-managed fund of funds which invests in eight defined sectors: consumer goods, natural resources, technologies, finance, utilities, health, telecommunications, and industry. The fund is thus exposed to all of the sectors of the MSCI World index except energy. The fund, managed by Andrew Matteis, head of large caps research at Putnam, will be offered in six different share classes, with total expense ratios (TER) ranging from 188 to 218 basis points.
