Aurelius attacks Irish government over Anglo Irish Bank debt


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Wall Street Journal reports that the hedge fund Aurelius from Mark Brodsky bought junior debt from the Anglo Irish Bank at Usd20 cents on the dollar, and refused to sell it to the Irish government at the same price. It is hoping to make much more, as it has often done in similar situations. But this time, it is up against a government, and Dublin is all the less inclined to give in due to the pressure it is under from European governments. In the first half of 2010, Aurelius saw its assets under management increase from USD750m to USD2.5bn. In January-October, its returns were 12%, following more than 30% in 2009, and losses of only 4% in 2008. Aurelius was not the only hedge fund to pursue opportunities abroad: Balestra Capital, Hayman Capital Partners, North Asset Management and Pivot Capital Management did likewise.
