Goldman Sachs preparing an equities ETF


Handelsblatt reports that Goldman Sachs has submitted an application to the SEC for its first US-registered ETF fund. It would be an equity product, which would replicate an index, weighted according to the book value and ROE or dividends, not to market cap. Goldman Sachs is also planning bond and wealth-management type ETFs.
