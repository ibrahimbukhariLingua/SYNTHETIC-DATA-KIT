DerivExperts sets up shop in London


The French valuation specialist DerivExperts on 9 January announced the opening of an office in London. The London branch represents a new step in the development of DerivExperts, and accompanies the deployment of its valuation platform for OTC products, the firm says in a statement.It will be active once European Market Infrastructure (EMIR) regulations come into force in 2013, to improve the transparency of risks on over-the-counter derivative markets, and from 22 July 2013, when the law will have been fully transposed in all countries concerned by the Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFM) directive, which regulates managers of non-UCITS funds.As Francis Cornut, chairman of DeriveExperts, explains: “as part of the development of our valuation platform for OTC products, London, the European centre of alternative management, is a natural place for a location necessarily to be, and this is all the more apparent as soon as EMIR and AIFM regulations come into effect. It allows us to extend our expertise, multiply the reach of our valuations, and bring our clients a vision which is both complete and thorough for their various valuation issues.”The London office will be led by Francis Cornut, and will have a team of 6 people at its opening in January, with the objective of rapidly recruiting more partners.
