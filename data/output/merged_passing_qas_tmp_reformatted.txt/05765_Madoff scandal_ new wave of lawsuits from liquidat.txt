Madoff scandal: new wave of lawsuits from liquidator


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } On Wednesday, Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee for Bernard L. Madoff Securities, filed a new round of lawsuits, seeking money from five grandchildren of Madoff, and seeking to recuperate USD1.4bn from seven banks, the Wall Street Journal reports. He accuses Citibank, Natixis, Fortis Prime Fund Solutions Bank (Ireland), ABN Amro Bank, BBVA, Nomura Bank International and Merrill Lynch International of failing to notice signs of fraud. He is also suing the administrators for Madoff in the United Kingdom for USD80m. Picard is under pressure to claw back money, as Federal law allows him to file lawsuits only until Saturday, the anniversary of Madoffâ€™s arrest.
