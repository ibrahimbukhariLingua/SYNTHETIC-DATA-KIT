French regulator allows bond liquidity futures


The French financial market regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), has announced that in a decision dated 10 May 2012, it has authorised a new market practice in relartion to bond liquidity futures. The decision lays out a framework for liquidity futures, including: independent requirements which providers must observe; conditions for their interventions in markets for securities from issuers; transparency requirements to maintain, including a requirement to make monthly declarations to the AMF. The AMF decision has triggered a series of consultations, and follows a request submitted by Paris Europlace as part of work to identify ways to bring more liquidity to the secondary bond markets. Some market actors had sought to establish bond liquidity futures, inspired by the ones which already exist on equity markets, which would be handed to an intermediate to manage with the goal of enabling actors to intervene freely on the secondary markets for their securities. The declaration form for bonds under a liqudity future, is available on the AMF website, under Issuers > Forms > Bond liquidity futures declaration form. It is to be submitted to the AMF in electronic form, to the following address: ReportingCLOblig@amf-france.org.
