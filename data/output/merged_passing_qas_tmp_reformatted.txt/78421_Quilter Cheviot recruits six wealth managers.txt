Quilter Cheviot recruits six wealth managers


The British wealth management firm Quilter Cheviot has announced the appointment of six new wealth managers, bringing total staff on the financial investment team to 162, at 12 offices. Since the beginning of the year, the business has recruited Lawrence Cotton, James Hughes and Andrew Jones for its London office. The first two men join from WH Ireland, where they had been senior wealth managers. Jones worked at Royal Bank of Canada from 2009 to 2015 as senior wealth manager, and then took a break from the industry. In addition to these three recruitments, Andy Smillie has joined the Glasgow office from Tilney Investment Management, where he had been a wealth management partner. Lorraine Antypova joins the Liverpool office from Blankstone Sington where he had been a portfolio manager, and Thomas Lovell, former investment director at Rathbones, joins the Jersey team. “Continuing to grow our investment team is one of our priorities in the coming year, and we are expecting to see new professionals join the team of experienced investment professionals in the coming months,” Andy McGlone, CEO of Quilter Cheviot, says in a statement.
