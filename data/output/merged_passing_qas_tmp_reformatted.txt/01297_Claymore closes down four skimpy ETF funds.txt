Claymore closes down four skimpy ETF funds


Four ETF funds from Claymore Securities with assets totalling only about USD35.7m, out of a total of USD2.5bn managed in the group’s ETFs, will be closed and liquidated, Christian Magoon, president of the firm, has announced. The products, “too lightly followed” by investors, are the Claymore/Morningstar Manufacturing Super Sector Index ETF, Claymore/Morningstar Information Super Sector Index ETF, Claymore Services Super Sector Index ETF and Claymore U.S.-1 - The Capital Markets Index ETF; they will cease to be listed on the Arca platform from the New York Stock Exchange at the close of trading on 11 December.
