BlackRock acquires eFront in Paris


BlackRock on Friday announced that it has made a firm offer as part of exclusive negotiations to acquire 100% of capital in eFront from Bridgepoint and employees of the company, for a total of $1.3bn in cash. eFront, founded in 1999 by Olivier Dellenbach, describes itself on its website as the “top provider of software solutions dedicated to the financial industry, with recognised experiencein alternative investment and risk management. Solutions from eFront support major companies in the private equity, real estate investment, banking and insurance sectors.” The firm, which serves 850 clients in 48 countries with 700 employees, was acquired by Bridgepoint in 2015. It will now join Aladdin, the investment transaction system from BlackRock used by over 225 institutions. “Offering the cutting-edge capacities of eFront to the Aladdin community will allow clients to access an approach covering all of the portfolio which Aladdin itself provides,” says Rob Goldstein, chief operating officer at BlackRock, in a press statement. “Technology and liquid alternative assets represent two pillars of growth at BlackRock, and this transaction will bring us a unique opportunity to accelerate our positioning in these two areas,” says LaurenceFink, chairman and CEO of BlackRock. “We are particularly enthusiastic given the global reach of eFront, and its headquarters in Paris, which is a key market in continental Europe for BlackRock,” he adds. “As a global asset management firm, we are increasingly concentrating on understanding the unique needs of clients within each community where we operate. Efront immediately reinforces our presence and our technological capacities in France, Europe and worldwide,” Fink highlights. BlackRock has also announced that it will buy up about 3.1 million of its own shares at a price of $412.84 per share, as part of a private transaction. The operation is expected to be completed on 25 March. At that time, the group will have bought back about $1.6bn ot its own shares in 2019, and will have reached its equity repurchasing limit for the year 2019.
