United Kingdom - Madoff’s London affiliate may be implicated in fraud


The British Serious Fraud Office suspects that Madoff Securities International Ltd. of London was involved in Madoff’s fraud network, the Wall Street Journal reports. In 2008, the US firm Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities transferred GBP698m to its London affiliate, which in return wired GBP1.1bn to the US parent company. The payment allowed Madoff to convey the impression that London was a centre of profit. The Serious Fraud Office may in the next few months charge several people related to the UK operation, which employed 25 staff and appears to have had real operations. But declared operating profits in 2007 were limited to GBP7.6m.
