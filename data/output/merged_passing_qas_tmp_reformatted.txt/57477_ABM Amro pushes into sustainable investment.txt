ABM Amro pushes into sustainable investment


Kees van Dijkhuizen, CEO of the ABN Amro group, is accelerating sustainable investment. From 2018, sustainable investment will be the benchmark for all private and retail clients in the Netherlands, the CEO announced on 8 November, at a release of its quarterly results. “Our objective is to double the volume of sustainable assets from clients in the next three years, from EUR8bn to EUR16bn,” the head says in a statement. Van Dijkhuizen explains that the group will contact existing clients to discuss a voluntary transition from traditional investment to sustainable investment. “We have developed a solid green bond franchise in euros to help to finance sustainable development initiatives by our clients, and have been involved in eight green bond operations in various regions and sectors this year, raising more than EUR4.5bn,” the director adds.
