DNCA opens a branch in Italy


The French management firm DNCA Finance has opened an Italian branch office in Milan, on Via Broletto. The new office, opened on 19 September, is part of the French asset management firm’s straegy to develop on the Italian market, where since 2008 it has offered sub-funds of its Sicav DNCA Invest, via distribution agreements with IFA and private banking networks, a statement released in Italy says. DNCA Finance already had a sales team in Italy, which was located at the offices of its former majority shareholder, the Italian business bank Banca Leonardo. With the sale of nearly all of the latter’s stake to TA Associates, the opening of a branch office became necessary. The Italian team at DNCA is composed of two people who report to Enrico Trassinelli, who previously worked at Mellon Global Investments and ING.
