Concerns about volatility ETFs


The increasing success of funds trading on the volatility of US equities are the subject of concern on the part of investment advisers, the Financial Times reports. ETFs which track the Vix index from CBOE have had record subscriptions this year. But these products have regularly lost money, not only because the volatility of equities has fallen, but also because fund promoters periodically need to buy new Vix futures contracts, which are costly.
