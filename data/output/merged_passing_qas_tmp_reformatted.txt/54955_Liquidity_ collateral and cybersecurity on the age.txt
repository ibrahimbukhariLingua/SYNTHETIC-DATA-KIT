Liquidity, collateral and cybersecurity on the agenda in latest IOSCO outlooks


IOSCO on 2 March released its “Securities Markets Risk Outlook 2016,” which studies the major trends on international financial markets and main risks which may engender financial stability.The document identified four major potential risks: firstly, liquidity on the corporate bond market. The growth of primary markets in the corporate bond sector was the subject of concerns about the ability of the secondary market structure to hold up in periods of stress. The findings of the analysis are nuanced until additional data can further clarify this issue.Another issue is risks associated with the use of collateral in financial transactions in contexts in which services related to collateral operate, such as collateral optimisation, collateral transformation, collateral arbitrage and recollateralization (reuse) of collateral. These collateral management activities can present inherent risk transfers as a result of their structure, which may have an impact on larger market interconnections, and may create potential concentration of risk with the purveyors of these services.A third point is reprehensible conduct in the distribution of retail financial products, which can take multiple forms. Frequently cited are cases of abusive sales of unit-linked products or structured products. These products are complex by nature and many nvestors and advisers still do not understand all of the difficulties related to these products adequately. High commissions on some of these products can also incite advisers to push them, to the detriment of other asset classes.The document lastly raises the question of cybersecurity, as threats in this area are rising in terms of frequency, sophistication and complexity over the years, and now represent a systemic risk. Regulators the world over are working to reduce cyber-risk and to increase the resistance of financial systems as they confront these risks.
