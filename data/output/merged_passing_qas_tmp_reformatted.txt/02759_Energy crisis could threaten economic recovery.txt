Energy crisis could threaten economic recovery


Le Temps reports that Fatih Birol, chief economist at the International Energy Agency, sounds the alarm about a looming energy crisis in a recent interview with the British newspaper The Independent. The expert estimates that an energy crisis will threaten economic recovery if it emerges in the next five years. Most of the major oil fields have already past their peak production. Worldwide, the crisis is sure to come in the next ten years, says Birol, putting it ten years earlier than the latest projections.
