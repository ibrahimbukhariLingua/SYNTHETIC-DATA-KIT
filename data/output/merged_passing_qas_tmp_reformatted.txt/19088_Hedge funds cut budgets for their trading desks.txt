Hedge funds cut budgets for their trading desks


A survey by Greenwich Associates of 232 head traders and traders at several buy-side institutions (asset management firms, corporate treasuries, pension funds, charities, hedge funds, banks and insurance companies) finds that about 20% of respondents in 2012 reduced the budget they allocate to their market trading activities compared with 2011, while 30% have increased it. However, Greenwich Associates notes that 44% of hedge funds in the sample have reduced their budgets, and that 40% have maintained them unchanged. This result shows that hedge funds are moving much more aggressively than other institutional investors to reduce the size and cost of their market trading activities in the midst of a general slowdown in securities trading activities.
