Guggenheim opens a hedge fund access platform


The US firm Guggenheim Investment Advisory, an affiliate of Guggenheim Partners, on 14 November announced the launch of the Guggenheim Alternatives Platform, which will facilitate access to hedge funds for wealth management professionals. The web-based platform is designed especially for independent financial advisers, private banks, and trusts. Actors may use it to construct and deploy customised hedge fund portfolios for their clients, from a vast selection of over 50 selected hedge fund managers (some of whom have a capacity limit), from a universe of over 10,000 managers, with a thematic focus on “support.”The minimal limit for access to the service is very low (USD100,000), and flows are integrated into the Alternative Investment Products (AIP) service from the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which offers higher levels of transparency through standardised and simplified reporting, settlement, and constant monitoring of funds on the Guggenheim Alternatives Platform.
