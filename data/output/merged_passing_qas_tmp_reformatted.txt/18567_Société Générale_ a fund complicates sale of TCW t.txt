Société Générale: a fund complicates sale of TCW to Carlyle


The sale by Société Générale of its asset management affiliate TCW to Carlyle, made official on 9 August, is moving ahead, Les Echos reports. The operation is expected to be completed in first quarter next year, but a lawsuit against TCW, filed in Los Angeles on 21 August before a Federal court by the institutional investor EIG Global Energy Partner, may delay the sale. EIG claims it has a right of veto which it acquired during the creation of a joint venture with TCW last year, and which specifies that any change of control concerning one of the co-shareholders in the joint venture cannot act without the agreement of the board of directors of the joint venture, on which EIG controls a majority of seats. A hearing is scheduled for this morning in Los Angeles.
