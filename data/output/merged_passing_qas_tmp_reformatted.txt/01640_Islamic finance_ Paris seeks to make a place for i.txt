Islamic finance: Paris seeks to make a place for itself


Islamic resources offer attractive solutions for businesses in search of financing, but there are still obstacles to overcome before their use becomes commonplace, Les Echos reports. At a conference held at Bercy on the subject of Islamic finance, participants defined several of these obstacles, including the very limited presence of instruments denominated in Euros; the cost of constructing the financial apparatus; the lack of harmonisation between varying interpretations of Sharia law, the need to develop expertise in these financial instruments, and the difficulty of obtaining direct access to the final investor. The rising presence of the Paris centre in this segment could make it possible to alleviate some of these difficulties.
