Cost-cutting is not a priority for European asset management firms


Asset managers in Europe with profit margins under pressure are likely, in the near term at least, to spend more time looking to extract additional revenue from lucrative client segments and asset classes than on implementing specific cost-cutting measures, according to the latest The Cerulli Edge - Global Edition. «When we asked what they will be doing to protect profitability through the reminder of 2017 and next year, four in five of the managers Cerulli surveyed told us that they will be paying greater attention to client segments with higher profit margins,» says Barbara Wall, Europe managing director at Cerulli Associates, a global research and consulting firm.Two-thirds of the respondents to the Cerulli poll are also planning to focus more on high-margin asset classes such as alternatives. Just over half (53%) intend to reduce their operational costs as a means of protecting margins.Regulators are paying closer attention to the fees managers charge for distribution, advice, and management. This scrutiny is increasing pressure on managers’ overall profitability, as is the popularity of low-cost passive investing.
