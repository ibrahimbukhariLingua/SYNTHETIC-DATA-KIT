Investors unload nearly EUR30bn in equities in one week


As the end of June approached, investors adjusted their portfolios, including equity exposure, to take account for gradual tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, rising oil prices, continuing commercial tensions and political and social turbulence in Europe and elsewhere in the world, particularly in Latin America. The result was a lot of backwash in equity markets. In the week to 27 June, equity funds in all geographical regions combined posted net outflows of EUR29.7bn, the second-largest net outflows ever recorded in one week, according to a weekly survey by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, based on statistics from the global flow evolution monitoring specialist EPFR Global. In detail, US equity funds saw outflows of slightly over USD24bn, the third-highest amount ever recorded. European equity funds continued their positive momentum of previous weeks, with net outflows of USD3.9bn, for a sixteenth consecutive week of negative net outflows. Redemptions were more pronounced in the past week for French and German funds. The same trend can be seen for emerging market equities, which have seen net outflows of USD3.1bn. Japanese equity funds, however, benefited from significant net subscriptions of USd2.6bn. The situation is more mixed for bonds, with a week that ended with modest inflows of USD0.7bn. Investment grade bond funds, which appeared as a safe refuge, attracted nearly USD3bn. However, emerging market debt funds saw net outflows of USD3.2bn, the largest since the middle of fourth quarter 2016. High yield bond funds have seen their eighth consecutive week of net outflows, totalling USD2bn.
