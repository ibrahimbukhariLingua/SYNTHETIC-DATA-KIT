BNP Paribas AM adds to index-based and ETF team in Germany


BNP Paribas Asset Management is continuing to add to its teams dedicated to the development of its ETF and tracker activities in Europe, with the appointment of Chris Hofmann as senior sales manager for German-speaking clients, from the beginning of October 2017. Hofmann will be based in Munich, and will report to Claus Hecher, head of development for Germany, Austria, and German-speaking Switzerland. Hofmann will work to accelerate distribution of index-based products, particularly the range of BNP Paribas Easy ETFs, to institutional investors and German, Austrian and Swiss distribution networks. With this new recruitment, the teams at BNP Paribas Asset Management dedicated to index-based solutions and ETFs dedicated to the European market are continuing to grow. The German market is the second-largest market in terms of ETF investments in Europe (27.2% of assets), after the United Kingdom and before France, with over 550 ETFs listed, with EUR157bn in assets. Hofmann, 35, has ten years of experience in the ETF industry, and at UniCredit directed a large team dedicated to ETF sales in Europe. She began her professional career in 2006, as an ETF specialist at Lyxor, on the sales and marketing team dedicated to the German market, and then served as part of the UniCredit brokerage activity from 2009 to 2017, as head of ETF sales for Germany, Austria, Luxembourg and Switzerland. In 2010, she was promoted to head of ETF sales for Europe, and then in 2015 became head of ETF allocation advising in the wealth management department of UniCredit. Hofmann has a degree from the Accadis School of International Business (SIB) of Bad Homburg, and the American Business School of Paris.
