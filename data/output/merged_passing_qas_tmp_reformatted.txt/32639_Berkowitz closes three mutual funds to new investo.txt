Berkowitz closes three mutual funds to new investors


Bruce Berkowitz, the founder of the asset management firm Fairholem Funds, has announced that he has decided to close three mutual funds to new investors, at the end of the trading day on 28 February this year. Current shareholders will be permitted to continue to invest in the various funds. Fairholme explains in a statement that the decision comes largely as a result of the risk of diluting the current shareholders and the currently good positioning of the various funds for financing operations and realising new investments. Among the three funds which have been closed to new investors is the Fairholme Fund, whose assets under management total about USD7.5bn.
