Norway spurs debate on fossil fuels


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The decision by Norway to create a group of experts to study whether its USD840bn sovereign fund should cease to invest in fossil fuel businesses has triggered a wave of speculations, the Financial Times reports. If the fund were to sell off its stakes in this industry, it would not necessarily immediately affect Royal Dutch Shell or BP, which are both among the top 10 positions in the portfolio, nor other oil and gas companies which together represent 8.4% of equity investments by the fund. But it would galvanise a campaign to convince investors that fossil fuel businesses are increasingly risky bets.
