Edhec and CFA Institute strengthen executive education partnership


EDHEC-Risk Institute and CFA Institute on Friday announced the reinforcement of their executive education partnership (initiated in 2008 with the Advances in Asset Allocation Seminar) by offering the Advances in Equity Portfolio Construction Seminar. The course aims to provide investment practitioners with the tools to better understand the limits and benefits of different portfolio construction approaches, and to discuss alternative equity index strategies.The two-day programme is intended for finance practitioners who contribute to the design and implementation of portfolio construction models and is also insightful for investment professionals who analyse or decide on the adoption of appropriate model portfolios or benchmarks for equity investments, or who are interested in customising their strategic equity benchmark.The event will take place on 20-21 November, 2012 in Singapore and on 12-13 February, 2013 in London.
