Banks asked to avoid bitcoin in the absence of regulation


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } The European Banking Authority (EBA) on Friday called on European financial establishments to avoid bitcoin and other digital currencies so long as they are not governed by specific regulations. In a statement, the London-based authority advises national supervisory authorities to “discourage financial institutions from buying, holding or selling virtual currencies, as no regulatory regime is in place.” According to the EBA, which addressed the question in collaboration with the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA), the “risks (related to virtual currencies) outweigh the benefits” which the rapidity and economic nature of transactions bring. These risks are related to “money laundering or other financial crimes,” the EBA says. “A virtual currency mechanism could be created, and its functioning altered, by anyone, and in the case of decentralised mechanisms such as Bitcoin, anonymously, by anyone with enough computing power,” the banking authority warns. “IT security cannot be guaranteed,” while “the financial visibility of some participants on the market remains uncertain,” the EBA continues. Virtual currencies therefore will need to be regulated, according to the EBA, which addresses the recommendation to the European Council, the European Commission, and the European Parliament, via the creation of governance structures responsible for each virtual currency, which can be “held responsible for the integrity” of the currency.
