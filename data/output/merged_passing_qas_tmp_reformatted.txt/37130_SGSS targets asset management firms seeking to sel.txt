SGSS targets asset management firms seeking to sell UCITS funds in Europe


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Societe Generale Securities Services (SGSS) has launched “Manco by SGSS,” a solution for asset management firms which are seeking to create and sell UCITS funds in European markets. To assist asset management firms with their growth strategy within the EEA, SGSS is extending its internal ManCo license. With the use of this service, asset managers can create remote funds in all countries of the EEA, without the associated infrastructure or management costs of the registration process. “ManCo by SGSS” thus allows asset managers to outsource the entirety of the administrative process to be followed in order to comply with UCITS IV. The solution includes the following: - creating and structuring UCITS funds, in line with the administrative, legal and regulatory requirements involved in a launch within the EEA; - ensuring compliance with all regulatory obligations, such as risk management and reporting; - supplying the necessary post-market services and fund services (depository services, fund administration, holding general shareholders’ meetings, etc.); - facilitating fund distribution, through a wide range of paying agents, centralisers, local agencts, and SGSS representatives in 14 EEA countries, and for the structuring of “master-feeder” funds. All services provided as part of the “ManCo by SGSS” solution are part of the complete range of post-market services from SGSS, adapted to the most recent regulatory and market changes. The range also includes reporting services aimed at final investors, and the production of Key Invetor Information Documents (KIID). Asset managers also benefit from the recognized expertise of SGSS as an actor of reference in the securities profession in Europe.
