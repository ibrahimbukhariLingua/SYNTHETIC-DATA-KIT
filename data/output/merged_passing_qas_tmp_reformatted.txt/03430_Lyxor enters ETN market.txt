Lyxor enters ETN market


Since 16 April, NYSE Euronext Paris has listed the exchange-traded note product Lyxor ETN Gold (XS0416722857), which debuted in London the previous month. Lyxor has nonetheless waited for the first “in vivo” results for the product before announcing its release. It becomes the first of a new range of products for which ten products are planned by the end of this year, including at least one short gold product. All the products will necessarily have an underlying which is available for sale in France. As the experimental Gold product, which reproduces the evolution of the price of one ounce of gold, has proven successful, its two younger siblings were also unveiled to the media on Thursday. They are ETN (exchange traded notes) based on oil, entitled Lyxor ETN Oil (XS0416703808) and Lyxor ETN Short Oil (XS0416714599). The bonds, similar to ETFs, are issued by a dedicated segment, and are housed exclusively within the Luxembourg-registered Codeis Securities fund, underwritten by Société Générale. The products are listed on NYSE Euronext Paris. Their value is 100% covered by Euro zone debt or co-ordinated funds containing a minimum of 90% of these bonds, and rated AAAf by Standard & Poor’s. The two oil ETN products are based on “intelligent” indexes denominated in US dollars, developed by Société Générale, entitled SGI Smart WTI Long Invest and SGI WTI Short Invest, with set fees of 0.60% per year for the former, and 0.75% per year for the latter fund. Variable fees, which are directly tied to the guarantee offered by the collateral mechanism, are both set at 0.05% as of 3 June.
