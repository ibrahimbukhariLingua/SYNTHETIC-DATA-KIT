Klaus Kaldemorgen lends his name to his first hedge fund


Although two funds managed by the star DWS manager Klaus Kaldemorgen, the DWS Akkumula and DWS Vermögensbildung I, lagged far behind the market last year, and the situation does not appear likely to improve in 2011 (with losses of about 5% so far), DWS does not appear to be concerned, and has named his new fund, DWS Concept Kaldemorgen, which applies a total return approach described in the sales brochure as “multi-strategy à la Kaldemorgen” (equities, bonds, derivatives) after the guru, Handelsblatt reports.The concept is nothing revolutionary: it is a “hedge fund lite” similar to those that other firms have in their product ranges. The fund may not offer innovation, but it does have a big name. DWS does not mention that Kaldemorgen has in the past been known as an equities manager, not as a hedge fund manager. Anyway, the fund is expected to be a commercial success for DWS, with the Kaldemorgen name and sales strength of the management firm behind it. It remains however to be seen whether the product will be profitable for investors, the newspaper concludes.
