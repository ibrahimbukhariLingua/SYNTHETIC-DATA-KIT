The Chinese investment fund Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund on 8 December announced that it will be pulling out of plans to acquire the German semiconductor manufacturing specialist Aixtron, after a veto from the United States. The US President, Barack Obama, a few days ago rejected the planned acquisition of Aixtron, which Washington was entitled to rule on for reasons of national security, as some of the technologies from Aixtron are used by the US Department of Defence. The Chinese commerce minister on 9 December criticised the decision of the United States. “In the name of national security, the United States often fall wide of commercial principles in order to obstruct normal economic activity,” a spokesperson for the minister, Shen Danyang, stated, cited by Reuters. The operation was compliant “with international economic practices and the principles of the market and should not have had to be subject to political interference,” the spokesperson added.
