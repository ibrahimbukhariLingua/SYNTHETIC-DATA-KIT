Barclays WM France launches an Asian equities fund


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Barclays Wealth Managers France has launched the Barclays Equity Asia fund, a sub-fund of its Luxembourg Sicav, investing in Asian equities. The new fund is advised by Philip Niem, head of discretionary management at Barclays Wealth Asia, based in Hong Kong, and his team. Niem manages USD300m in assets with the same method used for the new fund. The objective for Barclays Equity Asia is to invest in businesses expected to profit from economic growth in China, India, and other surrounding Asian countries (excluding Japan), and to outperform its benchmark index (90% MSCI AC Asia ex Japan 10% cash) by 5% per year. Allocation by country is determined on the basis of the size of the economy, the balance of payments, growth in corporate profits and price/earnings ratio for the market. Niem will then select sectors which he estimates will outperform national GDP growth. Within these sectors, the head of discretionary management will select 40 businesses. Currently, Niem favours the banking sector in India, the consumer sector in China, and commodities. The Barclays Equity Asia fund, which has recently received a sales license from the AMF, now has total assets of USD30m. It will be sold via the Barclays Wealth network, as well as to funds of funds and institutional investors.
