EFAMA denounces financial transaction tax


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } A planned tax on financial transactions (FTT) limited to 11 countries of the European Union has come in for criticism by the European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA). According to estimates by the professional association, the new version of the FTT would have cost EUR13bn if the tax had been applied from the beginning of 2011. This total includes EUR7.3bn coing from countries in the FTT area, and EUR5.7bn from the non-FTT area.At a time when governments are expected to do more to encourage long-term financial savings and reduce dependency on the state to finance retirement, “the planned FTT is a move in the opposite direction, and punishes savers,” EFAMA claims. The application of FTT in a limited number of member states will lead to discussions about competition within the single European market which will lead asset management activities to move out of the FTT area.EFAMA “strongly opposes the FTT, which investors will have to pay (at least) twice, and which will considerably reduce the attractiveness of savings in funds and pension programmes. The result will be totally unjustified with regard to the important social role which investment funds play, and the international reputation acquired by UCITS funds as a model of excellence on the long-term savings market,” Peter de Proft, CEO of EFAMA, says.
