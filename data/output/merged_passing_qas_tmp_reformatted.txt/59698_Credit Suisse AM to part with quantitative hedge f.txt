p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Credit Suisse Asset Management (Credit Suisse AM) is planning to let the team in charge of its quantitative hedge fund go by the end of the year, Finews reports, citing information in HFMWeek. In October 2016, the Swiss group launched Qube, a quantitative and systematic hedge fund led by Pierre-Yves Morlat, based in London. Since its launch, the vehicle has attracted USD1bn in assets. The fund may now become independent, and be taken over by its team as part of a management buyout. The objective is reportedly to create a separate company, entitled Quantitative and Systematic Asset Management (QSAM), according to a source cited by HFMWeek. The team at QSAM, which has nearly 100 members, is reported to be distributed between Paris, Hong Kong and Mumbai. When contacted by Finews, Credit Suisse did not wish to comment.
