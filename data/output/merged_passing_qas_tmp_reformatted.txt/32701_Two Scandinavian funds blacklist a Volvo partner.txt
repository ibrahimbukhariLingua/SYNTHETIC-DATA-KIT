Two Scandinavian funds blacklist a Volvo partner


The seventh Swedish AP fund and the Norwegian oil fund have blacklisted Dong Feng, the owner of a Chinese truck maker in which Volvo has acquired a 45% stake, as the firm has sold military equipment to countries that are currently subject to UN embargoes, The Local.se reports, citing Swedish television. The Swedish fund will not be allowed to acquire shares in Dong Feng. However, it has no plans to revise its stake in Volvo.
