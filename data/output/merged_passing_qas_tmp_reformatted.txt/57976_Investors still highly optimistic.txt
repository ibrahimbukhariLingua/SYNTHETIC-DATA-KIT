Investors still highly optimistic


Investors remain highly optimistic in early October. They have reduced their liquidity allocations from 5.8% to 4.7%, the lowest level in two and a half years, the most recent survey by BofA Merrill Lynch, undertaken between 6 and 12 October, and covering a sample of 207 respondents with USD585bn in assets suggests. Meanwhile, 41% of investors are expecting further improvement in the economic situation in the coming 12 months, compared with 25% last month, but a record 62% at the start of the year.Euro zone equities remain highly popular. “Europe is in fashion, according to international investors, with overweight positions on euro zone equities near record levels, and profit outlooks for equities rising sharply. European investors remain optimistic about macro outlooks, and are prediciting a global upturn,” says Ronan Carr, European equity strategist. However, asset managers are positioning themselves for rising returns, coming back to banks and Japan, which are assets that will profit from rising interest rates and inflation, and divesting from utilities, emerging markets, health care and bonds.
