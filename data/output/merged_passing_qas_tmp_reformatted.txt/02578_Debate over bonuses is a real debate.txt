Debate over bonuses is a real debate


In an interview with Les Echos, the diplomat and former business banker Felix Rohatyn says that “the debate over bonuses is a real debate. It touches on the crucial question of the redistribution of national wealth. It deals with the nature of capitalism which we choose to promote. This is a subject which will continue to be central. But the administration and Congress will try not to go too far, since, at the end of the day, I am afraid they will not dare to impose solutions which will lead to overly fundamental changes in this area. I think a form of pragmatism will prevail on this subject.” Rohatyn claims that “finance has become a sort of public danger. We are trying to find ways to limit it. But, so far, the new financial regulatory plans of the Obama administration have fallen short of expectations. Many observers feel that it is not tough enough compared with the way in which the automotive industry in the country has been treated.”
