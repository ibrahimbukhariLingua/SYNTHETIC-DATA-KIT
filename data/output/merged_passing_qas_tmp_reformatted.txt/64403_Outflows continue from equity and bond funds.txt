Outflows continue from equity and bond funds


Last week, equity funds posted massive outflows, totalling USD8.3bn, according to a study released on Friday, 21 December by Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research, based on data from EPFR Globa, a research company specialised in monitoring subscription flows at major international asset management firms. As global stock markets remain on edge, the study finds that flows are still not giving a buy signal for high-risk assets. US equity funds posted net outflows totalling USD4.4bn, while European equity funds lost USD5.4bn. This represents the fourth-largest total weekly net outflow figure ever recorded by EPFR Global. Japanese equity funds meanwhile posted net inflows of USD10.1bn. This is the second time in 13 weeks that flos to bond funds have been in negative territory. However, it has been a good week for funds dedicated to government bonds, which attracted USD5bn. Funds specialised in precious metals, mainly gold, a traditional refuge stock, also saw net inflows totalling USD400m. Analysts at Merrill Lynch note that the Bull & Bear indicator, which seeks to identify entry or exit signals from high-risk markets, is not far off the buy signal. They say “incoming flows to emerging markets and the rising proportion of cash in asset allocations by managers are preventing it from ticking over into buy.” The synthetic indicator currently stands at 2.5, near the 2.0 level which indicates a buy signal.
