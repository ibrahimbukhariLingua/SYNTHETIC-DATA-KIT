Investors seeking pockets of value


In the week ending on 22 February, equity funds underwent a net outflow of USD5.9bn, according to statistics from EPFR Global. Emerging market equity funds posted their lowest inflows in eight weeks, while US equity funds finished the period under review with outflows of nearly USD6bn, as investors took the occasion of a Dow Jones flirting with the 13,000 point threshold to take their profits. Investors turned to equity funds dedicated to frontier markets, however, which showed their highest inflows since July 2011. Bond funds have posted inflows of over USD5bn for the fifth consecutive week, while cumulative inflows since the beginning of the year totalled USD50.9bn. High-risk bond asset classes were favoured by investors, with net inflows of USD1.3bn for high yield bond funds, and USD701m for emerging market bond funds. Uncertainty about Greek debt weighed down European bond funds, which despite this, show net inflows of USD1.6bn since the beginning of the year. Money market funds attracted a net total of USD4.82bn, which brings outflows since the beginning of the year under the USD60bn level.
