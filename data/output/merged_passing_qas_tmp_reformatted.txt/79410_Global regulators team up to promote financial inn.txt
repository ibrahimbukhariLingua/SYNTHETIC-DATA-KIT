Global regulators team up to promote financial innovation


On 1 February, The Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN), an international network of financial sector regulatory bodies, which works to support financial innovation that benefits consumers, was officially launched. Among other objectives, the GFIN aims to offer fintechs a way to test their innovative products, services or business models simultaneously on financial markets subject to different laws and regulations. The GFIN, which includes 29 bodies, among them the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in the United States, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and the central bank of Hungary, hopes to accept new members in the coming months. To initiate its work, the GFIN has launched a pilot project aimed at financial technology (fintech) businesses and participating regulators. The fintechs will have an opportunity to run tests and measure competition in the regulated area, and their experience will help to orient work in the network. The members of the GFIN will use these tests to coordinate efforts to better support financial innovation in an international context. The tests will be conducted over a period of at least six months, and must begin in Spring 2019. Interested companies have until 28 February to submit a participation application to be eligible for this first round of trials.
