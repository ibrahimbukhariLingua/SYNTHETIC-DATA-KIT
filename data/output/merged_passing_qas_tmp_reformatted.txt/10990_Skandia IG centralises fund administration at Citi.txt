Skandia IG centralises fund administration at Citi


“In order to reduce administrative costs paid by clients,” Skandia Investment Group (SIG) has announced that it has outsourced administration of all of its funds to Citi. The decision on the part of SIG, which is a part of the Long Term Savings division of the Old Mutual group, is a result of developments in the fund management sector in Europe, particularly the introduction of UCITS IV regulation. SIG had USD22.9bn in assets under management as of the end of June.The Irish range from Skandia Global Funds was already administered by Citi, while the range from Skandia Investment Management had relied on another third-party administrator (TPA).
