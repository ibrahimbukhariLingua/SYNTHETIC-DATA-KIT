Hedge funds: future of Geneva market plays out between Bern and Brussels


According to AGEFI Switzerland, the Swiss finance minister, David Hiler, who 18 months ago raised the idea of attracting hedge funds to Switzerland and to Geneva in particular, can still rely on considerable interest on the part of specialists in alternative investment who are considering leaving the City of London. The consulting firm Kinetic Partners has advised 23 relocations of hedge funds to Geneva since August 2007. Glen Millar, director of the Geneva office, confirms that requests for information are continuing to increase: the firm has 15 such projects currently active. These moves are being driven by two factors. “On the one hand, the British alternative industry has encountered several difficulties in the past few years, such as an increase in taxes on managers, planned for next year, as well as the cancellation of advantages related to “non-dom” status, and to changes to social security rules.” On the other hand, the future of the sector may be strongly influenced by the European Union directive on alternative investment managers: “Although the consequences of this directive for hedge fund activities in Switzerland are not yet known, managers are convinced that whatever happens, the situation will not be worse in Switzerland than in London,” says Millar.
