CPR AM sets international as one of its major areas for development in 2016


2015 was a record year for CPR AM. The firm has seen its assets rise to EUR37.6bn, compared with EUR28bn one year earlier. EUR2bn represent the contribution of themed management, which Amundi, its parent company, contracted out to it last year. However, this growth is mostly due to net inflows of over EUR4.8bn, a previously-unseen level. Net subscriptions were distributed between money markets, with EUR1.8bn, diversified, at EUR1.6bn, equities with EUR930m, and fixed income, with EUR460m.In terms of clients, the asset management firm is maintaining a balance: nearly 55% of inflows went to its major institutional and corporate clients. However, subscriptions also continued to rise from distribution and independent financial advisers. This now represents nearly 30% of assets under management, compared with 10% in 2009. For its activity dedicated to independent financial advisers, entitled “Le Comptoir,” net inflows totalled over EUR511m, compared with EUR290m in 2014. And 60% of subscriptions went to financial products from CPR AM or Amundi, while the remainder went to real estate products.Viewed from another standpoint, the weight of international assets now accounts for 10% of overall inflows, up by 30% compared with 2014. As such, the asset management firm is planning to foster this development in 2016, and to continue its development outside France. Jean-Eric Mercier, CEO of CPR AM, confirms that this is one of the major areas for development at CPR AM. “In 2015, international assets under management represented EUR2bn, and our net sales totalled EUR490m. In 2016, we would like to increase the assets in question to EUR3bn. In the mid-term, the head is aiming high, and is targeting a percentage of net subscriptions coming from abroad of 50% overall. To achieve that, the asset management firm has already begun its efforts. It is present in 10 countries, after strengthening its presence in western Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, with the support of Amundi, and that is not all. “We are in the process of launching a Global Silver Age fund in Korea for the joint venture NH CA,” says Mercier, stating that the promotion campaign was starting this week.
