Dividends up by more than 30% in first quarter


It has been a good start to the year for dividends, with some regional disparities, however. Dividends worldwide rose by 31.4% in first quarter, to a total of USD228.4bn, according to the quarterly index published by Henderson Global Investors. The Henderson Global Dividend Index reached a record 151.3. However, a special dividend of USD26bn distributed by Vodafone represented nearly half of the inrease observed in first quarter. Not counting special dividends, dividends are up by 12.1%, a pace not seen since fourth quarter 2012. The United States show the strongest growth, with a rise of 30.2% in total, and 16% in data corrected for special dividends and changes to indices. These increases are very widely distributed over virtually all sectors, with the exception of telecommunications and utilities, which have relatively low increases. Dividends are up 14.8% in the United Kingdom and 8.9% in Europe, driven by a strong pound Sterling and euro. However, second quarter is the biggest for Europe, with the short-term currency factor. In Japan, however, diidends were down 20.6% in first quarter, or 16% not counting special dividends, with the weak yen responsible for most of the decline. But Japanese corproate profits are oriented upward, which leaves potential for growth in dividends. Dividends in emerging markets are up 7% worldwide and in data corrected for special dividends.
