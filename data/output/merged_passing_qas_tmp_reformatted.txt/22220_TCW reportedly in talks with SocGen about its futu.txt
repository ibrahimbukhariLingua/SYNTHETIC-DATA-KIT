TCW reportedly in talks with SocGen about its future


The directors of TCW, an affiliate of SocGen, have begun preliminary talks with their parent company over an acquisition of the firm, Agefi reports, based on reports in Reuters. There is no formal sale process, and an acquisition of TCW by its directors is only one of several possibilities under consideration, one source says. SocGen denies all reports of a planned sale.
