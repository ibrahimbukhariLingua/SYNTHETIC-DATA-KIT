Wolbern Invest not included in sale of Bankhaus Wolbern


Fondsprofessionell reports that the M.M. Warburg private bank has indeed acquired Bankhaus Wölbern, but that the deal does not include Wölbern Invest, a promoter and manager of closed-ended investment funds. The reports were confirmed by Heinrich Maria Schulte, who was the owner of Bankhaus Wölbern and remains the owner of Wölbern Invest, a management firm created in a spinoff from the bank in April 2007.
