Yomoni, a specialist in online savings, has topped EUR40m in assets under management as of the end of 2017, the firm announced on 26 January. In the past year, Yomoni has seen its assets under management quadruple to a total of EUR44m as of the end of December 2017. As of 31 December 2017, the firm has a total of 6,000 clients, it adds. This growth has continued at the beginning of 2018, as the firm’s assets will top EUR50m for the first time in January 2018, with an inflow of EUR6m in January 2018 alone, “the equivalent of all of the inflows in our first year of activity,” the fintech says in a statement. Yomoni is now seeing bigger things. “The asset management firm has an ambition to exceed EUR100m under management by the end of 2018,” it says. In the longer term, the objective is to reach EUR1bn by 2020. “To continue on this trajectory in 2018, the asset management firm will aim at those in the higher asset levels with a special offer,” says Yomoni. The fintech is now working on an employee savings product range, which will be launched during the year, to assist directors and employees at SMEs and mid-sized businesses. The asset management firm is also planning to develop new partnerships. To extend strategic partnerships signed in 2017 with Vie+, Bankin’ and Max, Yomoni is also working with a major retail business which is planning to offer its employees extra services, and is proposing to offer them financial coaching to manage their savings,” the fintech says, without naming its partner.
