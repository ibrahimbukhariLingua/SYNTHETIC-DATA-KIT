Caisse des Dépôts merges asset management units


From 1 July, financial management teams at the Caisse des dépôts et consignations (CDC) dedicated to savings funds (EUR85bn) and the general section (EUR61bn) are one, AGEFI reports. The firm based in the rue de Lille in Paris has decided to unite its expertise as part of a single “financial investment department” led by Eric Flamarion, and overseen by Olivier Mareuse, director of savings funds, and Virginie Chapron du Jeu, group CFO.The new unit has EUR146bn in assets as of the end of April, and 100 personnel, putting it in fourth place among institutional investors in France. This perimeter does not include strategic stake holding by the group. Assets are more than 95% managed directly, as the CDC uses external managers only for non-public assets and for real estate allocations from savings funds.
