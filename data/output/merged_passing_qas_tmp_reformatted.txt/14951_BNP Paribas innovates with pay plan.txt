BNP Paribas innovates with pay plan


Due to the financial crisis, Baudouin Prot, CEO of BNP Paribas, has not received any stock options or free or performance-related share plans since 2008, Les Echos reports. To compensate for this situation, the board of directors at the bank has found a “more restrictive” substitute, which would allow it to improve the involvement of its director, and two other high-level employees, Jean-Laurent Bonnafé and Georges Chodron de Courcel, with the long-term performance of BNP Paribas’ share price. The three directors will receive cash payments, which will be paid only after a five-year period, under two conditions: one, that the BNP Paribas share price must have gained at least 5% in 2016 compared with its 2011 level; and two, that over that period and in each year, BNP Paribas shares must have outperformed the index of European banks.
