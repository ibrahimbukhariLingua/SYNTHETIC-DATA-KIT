The UCITS format strategy, co-managed by London-based managers Paul Doyle and Fred Jeanmarie, aims for positive returns regardless of market conditions. Columbia Threadneedle says in a statement that the fund has been launched at the request of clients who wish to have a strategy of this kind to benefit from volatility on the markets. The benchmark index is the Euribor 3-month, and the fund aims for returns 6% to 8% per year over the index over the duration of a market cycle ( three to five years). The fund has been initially registered in Luxembourg, and is expected to be sold in numerous European countries, including the United Kingdom, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Swtizerland, Finland, Norway and Sweden.
