Columbia Threadneedle Investments signs a strategic agreement in Brazil


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Columbia Threadneedle Investments has entered into an exclusive partnership with Rio Bravo Investimentos, the Brazilian independent money management firm founded by former central bank head Gustavo Franco, to launch a Brazilian domiciled fund available to Brazilian pension fund clients. The fund, wholly managed by Rio Bravo and designed as a feeder, is fully invested in Columbia Threadneedleâ€™s European Select strategy, a high alpha European equities portfolio. Due to current regulatory restrictions that prevent Brazilian corporate pension funds from holding more than 25% of total AUM of a fund, the Rio Bravo fund is launching with seed capital of BRL 34 million (approx. USD 8.5 million).
