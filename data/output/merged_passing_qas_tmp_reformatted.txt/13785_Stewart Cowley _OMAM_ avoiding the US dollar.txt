Stewart Cowley (OMAM) avoiding the US dollar


Stewart Cowley, head of fixed income at Old Mutual Asset Managers, is recommending avoiding the US dollar. At a conference organised by Expert Investor last week, Cowley claimed that it is time to start preparing for a fall in the value of the US currency, as the country is very far from having resolved its deficit problems. “The Fed looks like a leveraged hedge fund,” he says. However, although all eyes are currently on Greece, Cowley considers that the European restructuring plan is “credible.” Cowley had previously been avoiding the euro, but now he is gradually returning to the European currency. The head of fixed income at OMAM, who is also avoiding the Japanese yen, prefers commodity currencies, such as the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, and the South African rand. Cowley also states that he is avoiding government bonds, leaning toward a negative duration, and preferring businesses with low gearing and unique product positioning.
