European asset managers revising their sales strategies


Fund distribution through private banks, direct sales and proprietary channels (such as distribution agreements with banks) is set to increase significantly during the next 12 months, according to a research by the Luxembourg-based Kneip, a provider of services to the investment fund sector, undertaken in April this year, and covering 47 asset management firms, fund administrators, and providers. The survey finds that 42.9% of respondents are planning to increase to use private banks more, compared with only 14% in 2010. This development may be a result of a desire on the part of asset management firms to develop their activities serving high net worth clients. The study also finds that 34.3% of respondents would like to focus more on direct sales, a 14% increase over the level last year, and that 31.4% would like to use “proprietary” channels, such as distribution agreements with banking establishments. This latter solution has seen a 26% increase in the past 12 months. Unsurprisingly, the survey also finds that 94% of respondents cited that UCITS IV would have the most impact on the fund management industry in the next 12 months, up from 83% from last year. Europe remains the preferred investment region for 74.3% of respondents. This percentage is 9% lower, however, than the previous year. Investors are showing a growing interest in South America (Brazil, Chile) and Australia, the survey says, due to market growth as well as the opening of these markets to foreign funds in recent years.
