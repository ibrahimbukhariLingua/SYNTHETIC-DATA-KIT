AIFM: French regulator encourages asset managers to submit license applications


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } The French market regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), is encouraging asset management firms which have already complied with all requirements of the alternative investment fund managers (AIFM) directive, to submit their license applications under the AIFM directive “as soon as possible,” so that the first licenses can be issued by 22 July 2013, when the bill comes into effect. The call comes with a guide to assist existing asset management firms, published on Tuesday. The document is intended to assist asset management firms anticipating the transposition of the AIFM directive, and gives very concrete replies to any questions they may have. The AMF is also making available a dedicated email address, at aifm@amf-france.org. Lastly, in the next few weeks, it will publish a guide to the relevant funds under the AIFM directive.
