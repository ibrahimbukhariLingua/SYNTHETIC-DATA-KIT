Basel III: Europeans take an important step


European Union finance ministers yesterday reached agreement on rules to increase the owners’ equity requirements for banks, after making numerous concessions to London, Les Echos reports. The initial proposal would have raised the “hard” limit on owners’ equity for establishments from 2% to 7% in the long term. Ultimately, the compromise found leaves a way for individual countries to set two parallel owners’ equity requirements, one at 3% for all bank risks, and one at 2%, for domestic risks only. London also received a commitment that the European regulator (EBA) would not be authorised to consider whether the 3% limit is discriminatory in certain countries. An agreement must now be reached at the European Parliament.
