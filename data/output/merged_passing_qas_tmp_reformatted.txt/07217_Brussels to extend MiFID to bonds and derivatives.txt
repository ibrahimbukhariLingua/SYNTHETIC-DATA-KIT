Brussels to extend MiFID to bonds and derivatives


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Les Echos reports that the European Commission is planning to extend the application of the markets in financial instruments directive (MiFID), which currently applies only to equities markets. The rules may soon be extended to “bond markets, and particularly to derivative product markets,” the European commissioner for the internal market and financial services, Michel Barnier, announced in Brussels yesterday. The European Union, which is planning to increase responsibility for actors by “eliminating excessive risk-taking” and increasing investor protections, particularly for SMEs, is also seeking to guarantee fair competition between traditional and alternative platforms.
