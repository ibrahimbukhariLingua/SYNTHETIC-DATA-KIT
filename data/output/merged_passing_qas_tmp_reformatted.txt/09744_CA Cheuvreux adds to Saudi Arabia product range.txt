CA Cheuvreux adds to Saudi Arabia product range


Cr√©dit Agricole Cheuvreux is extending its product range on the Saudi Arabian market, with the release of an ad-hoc participatory notes (P-notes) product based on Saudi equities. In early 2009, CA Cheuvreux was one of the first brokers to offer access to the Saudi market, offering swaps on Saudi shares. Direct access to non-residents of Saudi Arabia (outside the Gulf Cooperation Council) to this market, the largest in the Middle East and the eleventh-largest in the world, is not allowed, says CE Cheuvreux in a statement. Therefore, it is offering its P-Notes program through its local executing broker, Fransi Tadawul, one of the largest local brokers, an affiliate of the Saudi Fransi Bank, which is 31.1% owned by Calyon.
