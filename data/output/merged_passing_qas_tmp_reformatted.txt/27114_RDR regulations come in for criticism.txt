RDR regulations come in for criticism


The chairman of the treasury select committee, Andrew Tyrie, has severely criticised the British financial market supervisory authorities (FCA, Financial Conduct Authority et PRA, Prudential Regulation Authority), whom he accuses of indiscriminately amassing useless data and not taking enough interest in the real impact of RDR regulations. At the Conservative party conference in Manchester, Tyrie admitted to Money Marketing that it was too soon to evaluate the damage due to RDR regulations, which came into force earlier this year. In May, the committee called for a study of the impact of RDR regulations, at a time when the director of the FCA, Martin Wheatley, admitted to a lack of advising during the summer season. While indicating that reforms of the commissions are inevitable, Tyrie adds that the introduction of the regulation “had the unfortunate consequence of consolidating the sector around a limited number of large players.” This development could damage competition and should be closely monitored.
