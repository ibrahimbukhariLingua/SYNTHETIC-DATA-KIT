Hedge fund seeks stricter rules for banks


Paul Singer, the billionaire hedge fund manager and influential donor to the Republican party, is putting pressure on United States presidential candidate Mitt Romney to toughen regulations on banks and go beyond the Dodd-Frank rule, the Financial Times reports. Instead of this law, which he claims is “misconceived,” Paul Singer is calling for stricter owners’ equity requirements and a regulatory framework which would require large banks to be more transparent concerning their liabilities and off-book instruments.
