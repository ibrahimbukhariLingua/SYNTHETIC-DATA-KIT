Fund managers outperform their benchmarks less and less often


According to a study by Standard & Poor’s *S&P), only 16% of active fund managers in 2011 managed to beat the S&P Composite 1500 index, the poorest result since statistics began in 2002, Handelsblatt reports. In 2010 and 2009, the percentage of “outperformers” was 42% and 59%, respectively. This failure to outperform extends to large caps as well as small caps. The statistics will fuel current controversies about the added value that actively-managed funds offer compared to ETFs.
