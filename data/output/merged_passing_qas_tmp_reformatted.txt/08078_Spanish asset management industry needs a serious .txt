Spanish asset management industry needs a serious overhaul, says AFI


Analistas Financieros Internacionales (AFI), which has been tasked by the Inverco association of management firms with studying the causes of a steep drop in assets under management, has found that Spanish funds are comparatively defensive, to the extent that the hemorrhage at the onset of the crisis was less due to the falling equities markets than it was to the “war for deposits,” as banks sought to attract savings investors to the detriment of investment funds, Cinco Días reports. From mid-2009 until February 2010 (when the study was carried out) however, net outflows were not related to this competition so much as they were to the fact that savings investors were seeking to offset both rising debts and reductions in their income. Emilio Ontiveros, president of AFI, says the asset management industry will need to restructure, since it is currently burdened with excess capacity, with 122 actors in the market, of which 39 saw losses in 2009.
