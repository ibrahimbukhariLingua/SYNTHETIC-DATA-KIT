p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The ETF provider Source has teamed up with Legal & General Investment Management to launch a physical replication fund platform, Source Markets II PLC. The new platform will allow Source to enlarge its current range of 15 physical replication funds, which include bond ETFs, ETPs backed by precious metals, and an ETF based on Chinese A-class equities. LGIM will provide the management of the new platform, while Northern Trust, already a provider to Source, will serve as administrator and depository. “The vocation for this new platform is to extend the selection for investors, so that they can choose the structure they prefer and with which they will be the most comfortable. Also, due to our increased capacity to launch physical replication products, which demonstrates the strong demand for this method of replication. Our intention is to offer all our investors the choice they deserve,” comments Lee Kranefuss, chairman of Source.
