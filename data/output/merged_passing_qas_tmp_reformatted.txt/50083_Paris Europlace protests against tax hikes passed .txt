Paris Europlace protests against tax hikes passed by government


Paris Europlace on 20 October expressed its “grave concern” following a vote in the French National Assembly debating the proposed 2017 finance law, including measures “incoherent and without organisation” concerning the institution of a new tax on operations within a single day and an increase in the financial transaction tax rate, in France, before the results of European discussions are known.Paris Europlace also denounces the increased taxation of free equity allocations (AGA), only six months after the new regime was put in place. French parliamentarians passed an amendment overnight on Wednesday which would subject free equity allocations to the income tax regime, and no longer to the securities capital gains regime, and which would increase the contribution from 20% to 30%.
