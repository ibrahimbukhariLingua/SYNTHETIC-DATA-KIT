EU - European Union in plans to regulate all alternative funds with assets over EUR250m


According to a draft European Union directive which has been obtained by Handelsblatt, the EU is planning to require private equity firms, hedge funds, open-ended real estate funds and institutional funds with assets of over EUR250m to register. The proposed legislation will be unveiled in Brussels on 21 April by single market commissioner Charlie McCreevy, if approved by other commissioners. The directive would come into force in early 2011.Aside from the registration requirement, the bill does not include much new regulation. The authorities will not be allowed to intervene in investment policies, and short-selling will continue to be allowed. However, sale of the products will be restricted to professional investors. The license will be issued to the fund only once the managers have provided detailed information, after the fund has amassed sufficient capital and provided details of its risk management. Rules relating to funds using high levels of leverage will be more severe. Funds which take large stakes in companies will also be required to satisfy stricter transparency requirements.
