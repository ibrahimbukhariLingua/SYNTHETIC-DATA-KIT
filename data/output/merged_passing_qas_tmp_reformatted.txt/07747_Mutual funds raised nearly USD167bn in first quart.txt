Mutual funds raised nearly USD167bn in first quarter


According to estimates by Morningstar, US mutual funds posted net subscriptions in June of USD13.5bn, compared with net redemptions of USD13.2bn in May (see Newsmanagers of 14 June). Net inflows in January-June totalled USD166.7bn, 24% more than in the corresponding period of last year. Despite a decline for the MSCI EAFE index and concerns due to falling foreign equities markets, international equities funds posted net subscriptions of USD19.6bn in first half, while US equities funds saw net outflows of nearly USD17bn. Morningstar points out that alternative mutual funds, many of which have been launched since the credit crisis, have posted record net inflows, such as the Pimco Fundamental Advantage Total Return, which took in more than USD3.3bn in the 12 months to the end of June. However, money market funds lost USD790.5bn in assets in the 12 months to the end of June, of which nearly 80% of outflows were from institutional share classes. For ETFs, net subscriptions in June (USD9.9bn) brought total net inflows since the beginning of the year to USD34bn. Two two funds with the strongest net subscriptions in June were the SPDR S&P 500 SPY, with USD2.6bn, and the SPDR Gold Shares GLD, with USD2.1bn. Morningstar points out that aside from the MSCI Germany Index EWG and the iShares FTSE/Xinhua China 25, which were apparently used by investors repositioning themselves in view of the looming government debt crisis in Europe, the vast majority of single country ETFs saw net outflows in June.
