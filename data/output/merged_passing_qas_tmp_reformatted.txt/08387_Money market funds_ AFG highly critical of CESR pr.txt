Money market funds: AFG highly critical of CESR proposals


The French association of asset managers (AFG) has issued a statement welcoming the “money market OPCVM” label in EU countries, but has expressed reticence about the details of the legislation proposed by the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR). The AFG expresses heartfelt regrets that the CESR has chosen to create two categories of OPCVM fund, “although it would have been better to allow product ranges to adapt to the needs of the various types of investors and to leave sufficient manoeuvering room to the manager to adapt to market conditions. The notion of ‘short-term’ is not the same for a retail investor, the treasurer of a business, a pension fund or an insurer,” the AFG explains in a statement. The association also regrets that the use of securities ratings as investment criteria has been made compulsory. Ratings, which are a useful decision-making tool for investors, by this measure becomes an extension of the regulator, and a regulatory constraint. It is not the mission or the area of expertise of ratings agencies to act in this capacity, and it is at least paradoxical from the point of view of the debates now underway to expect them to do so. The AFG claims that the required ratings level will tend to privilege government securities to the detriment of investments in corporate treasury issues from many companies, a “debatable orientation which is not highly favourable to good corporate financing.” Finally, the AFG finds it regrettable that the use of the term “constant net asset value” is allowed for some short-term money market OPCVM funds, though these funds are not guaranteed, as the CESR notes itself in its document.
