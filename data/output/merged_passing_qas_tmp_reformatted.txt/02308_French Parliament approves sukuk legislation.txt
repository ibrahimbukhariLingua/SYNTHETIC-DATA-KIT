French Parliament approves sukuk legislation


Les Echos reports that the French Parliament on 17 September passed a bill which would adapt the fiscal regime to allow for the issue of fiancial instruments that comply with Islamic law, including “sukuks,” bonds which respect the principles of Sharia, which do not allow for the payment of interests. The legislation is closely supported by Christine Lagarde, who wants to see France catch up with the UK in this area.
