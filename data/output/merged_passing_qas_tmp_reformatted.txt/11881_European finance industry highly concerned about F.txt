European finance industry highly concerned about FATCA legislation


The FATCA law (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) appears to be attracting a lot of attention worldwide already, particularly in Europe. According to a survey by RBC Dexia Investor Services, only 26% of financial companies surveyed had little or no knowledge of the legislation, which was passed last year, but about which few details are known so far. The survey finds that European financial institutions appear to attach a particularly high importance to the FATCA law, with 86% of respondents familiar with it. Despite questions which remain about the legislation, institutions which know about the law are actively preparing for it. The cost of application for the law is estimated at about USD1m. At the annual conference of the Luxembourg Investment Fund Association (ALFI), held on 27 and 28 September in Luxembourg, the president of the American financial management association (ICI), Paul Scott Stevens, expressed some reservations about the potential impact of the law. “We understand the concerns of foreign actors on this subject. But I don’t think the law can be substantially amended,” Stevens says. “I therefore think that we need to set up a functional framework.” After all, he concludes, “tax evasion is a subject which is not limited to the US tax authorities. Tax evasion is a concern for many authorities worldwide.”
