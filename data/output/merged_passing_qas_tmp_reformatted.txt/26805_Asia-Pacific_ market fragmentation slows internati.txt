Asia-Pacific: market fragmentation slows international development


The priority for asset management actors in the Asia-Pacific region is expansion into new markets in the region, but this development is running up against a major obstacle in the fragmentation of markets, a study carried out by State Street in partnership with Longitude Research, covering more than 200 managers in the asset management sector in the region finds.The suvey reveals that 42% of managers surveyed predict growth into new markets in the region, and that 298% of respondents even say that this is their number one engagement. This priority for new markets is particularly strong in Japan (52%), Hong Kong (285), China (23%) and Australia (also 23%).China is one of the most cited targets, but frontier markets are also among the possibilities envisaged, including Malaysia and Thailand.But these expansion plans are, according to a majority of respondents, running up against market fragmentation and the diversity of regulations, which impede product innovation. “The region is more fragmented than any other in the world in terms of size, geoography, language, culture, regulations and taxation,” says Damien Barry, senior vice president, Offshore Funds Services at State Street.The regional initiative launched recently for a passpot for Asian funds is a move in the right direction but its contours are still blurry. Meanwhile, 51% of respondents surveyed say that major adaptations have to be made to develop solid risk management strategies adapted to each market.
