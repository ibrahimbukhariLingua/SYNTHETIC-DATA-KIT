Natixis GAM to double assets in Asia-Pacific


Natixis Global Asset Management (Natixis GAM) is planning to double its assets under management in the Asia-Pacific region in the next three years, to bring them to USD100bn (about EUR85bn), the news agency Reuters reports. To achieve that, the asset management firm, an affiliate of the Natixis group, is betting on a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. “Our objective is very simple: it is to double it,” says Fabrice Chemouny, director for the Asia-Pacific region at Natixis Global Asset management, in an interview at a summit held by Reuters in Hong Kong on investment outlooks for 2018.The director states that China will play an essential role in achieving this objective. As a result, the Chinese authorities have decided to open their financial market more widely to foreign groups than previously to sell investment products. Asset managers had previously been required to remain as minority shareholders in Chinese joint ventures. They now have a way to control these joint ventures through a wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WFOE) license. “This is not a simple thing to do. Some have been in China for decades, have people on site and critical size,” says Chemouny. “I am not ready to make an application for a WFOE license.” However, he is calling on his teams to consider acquisitions or partnerships. In early October, Natixis announced the acquisition of a majority stake in the Australian firm Investors Mutual Limited, to develop asset management activities in Asia-Pacific. The Natixis group will present a new strategic plan on 20 November.
