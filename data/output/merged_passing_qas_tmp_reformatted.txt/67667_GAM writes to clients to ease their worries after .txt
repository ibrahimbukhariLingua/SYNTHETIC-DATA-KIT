GAM writes to clients to ease their worries after a manager is suspended


In the wake of the suspension of Tim Haywood, head of the absolute return/unconstrained bond strategy, which was announced by GAM Investments on 31 July, the asset management firm has written to its clients to provide them with a fuller explanation about the decision. The suspension of Haywood followed an internal enquiry concerning risk management procedures by the manager, who did not seem to be respecting all requirements in this area.Alexander Friedman, CEO of the Swiss asset management group, and Tim Rainsford, head of sales and distribution, hoped to respond to concerns expressed by investors. According to the two heads, recent events have been “highly destabilising” for many clients, and it was necessary to reassure them, in particular by emphasizing that the internal enquiry concerns only Haywood, and no other employees were identified in the investigation.The heads also say that, according to the study, the direction of the absolute return strategy has not seen any particular modifications following the enquiry, and that most importantly, there have been no negative consequences for the clients to date. However, the asset management firm reaffirms its commitment to “robust” risk management in all of its activities. GAM had already issued a profit warning in early July, which roused the suspicions of investors.
