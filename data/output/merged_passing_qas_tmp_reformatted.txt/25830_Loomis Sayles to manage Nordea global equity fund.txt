Loomis Sayles to manage Nordea global equity fund


Loomis, Sayles & Company, an affiliate of Natixis Global Asset Management, has formed an exclusive partnership with Nordea Investment Management to manage Nordea’s Global Opportunity Fund. Nordea will distribute both the fund and the institutional strategy throughout the UK and Europe. Nordea’s Global Opportunity Fund is an actively managed, high-conviction, large cap, global strategy with typically 45-65 holdings. The fund is co-managed by Eileen Riley and Lee Rosenbaum of Boston-based Loomis, Sayles & Company. Loomis Sayles’ global equity strategy was recently awarded a USD220 million mandate from Cumbria County Council, a local government pension scheme in the UK, bringing its global equity opportunities platform to over USD1.50 billion in assets under management.
