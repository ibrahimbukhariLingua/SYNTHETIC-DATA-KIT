Solvency 2 may cost British pension funds EUR500bn


Integrating the terms of the Solvency II directive into the revised IORP directive on professional pensions may cust nearly EUR500bn, or GBP400bn, to the British pension fund sector, according to an impact study published on 20 November by the British pensions regulator. The claims were calculated on the basis of an impact study undertaken by the European insurance and occupational pensions authority (EIOPA). The report finds, however, that many uncertainties persist, and that according to a more likely scenario, the lack to be made up would be smaller, but could be as much as GBP150bn.
