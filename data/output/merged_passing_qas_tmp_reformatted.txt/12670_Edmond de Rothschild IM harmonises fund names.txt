Edmond de Rothschild IM harmonises fund names


Edmond de Rothschild Investment Managers is making the names of its main flagship funds uniformly bear the name of the Edmond de Rotschild group to which it belongs. The name “Edmond de Rothschild” (abbreviated as EdR) will now be included in the name of every fund. The main objectives of the change are to strengthen the brand identity of the Edmond de Rothschild group, and to provide clients with better visibility of the Edmond de Rothschild Invesment Managers range. The changes will take effect from 31 August, and will have no impact on the funds in terms of their technical or management characteristics.
