Barclays plans to recruit private bankers


Barclays plans to add several hundred bankers to its staff to serve its richest clients in a push to break into the top ranks of global wealth managers. The wealth management business could contribute as much as GBP500m in pre-tax profits to the group within five years, more than three times the GBP145m earned by the division in 2009.
