Performance of multi-manager funds lacks consistency


Although the Retail Distribution Review (RDR) legislation is leading many independent financial advisers to outsource at least part of their investment decisions to multi-manager funds, the independent research agency Defaqto has warned against multi-manager funds, which have not delivered highly coherent or consistent results since 2008. According to Defaqto, only 25 multi-manager funds, out of a sample of 184 funds, have succeeded in maintaining a stable rating of 3, 4 or 5 out of 5 since June 2008. In other words, it is extremely difficult for a multi-manager fund to earn solid performance over the long term. Defaqto yesterday released a “Guide to Multi-Managers,” which lays out key points for advisors considering the choice of a multi-manager fund, including changes in the market in the past six months, an analysis of the coherence of multi-manager funds, an update on regulatory developments, and analysis of portfolio turnover. Currently, 26% of users of platforms outsource their investment decisions to a multi-manager. This trend is likely to accentuate as RDR legislation requires financial advisers to revise their development model by the end of the year.
