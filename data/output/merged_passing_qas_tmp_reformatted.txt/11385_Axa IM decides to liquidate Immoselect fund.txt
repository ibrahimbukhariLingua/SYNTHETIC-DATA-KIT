Axa IM decides to liquidate Immoselect fund


Redemptions from the open-ended real estate fund Immoselect (DE0009846451) from Axa IM Deutschland, which have been frozen since 17 November 2009, will not be reopened. The asset management firm has decided to liquidate the product by 20 October 2014, and to sell the 66 properties remaining in the portfolio.The fund, with EUR2.48bn in assets, managed by AXA Real Estate Investment Managers (AXA Real Estate) has only EUR238.6m in liquidity, which is insufficient to meet up to redemption demands announced by investors and distributors. The fund would have needed a liquidity level of at least 30%, rather than its present level of under 10%.The proceeds from sales of the properties will be distributed to investors semiannually, probably beginning in April 2012.
