A new tax haven for high net worth private investors: unit-linked life insurance policies in Luxembourg


Spanish high net worth private investors have discovered the appeal of unit-linked life insurance policies in Luxembourg, whose primary inconvenience is their high cost (3%). But these assets are more discreet in relation to the Spanish tax authorities than the Sicav funds ordinarily chosen by ultra-high net worth clients, many of whom are directors of businesses, and they are sheltered from seizure by the tax authorities, Expansi√≥n reports. In addition, it is possible to invest in virtually any asset class, and there is no need to have at least 100 investors, as there is for a Sicav. Lastly, these assets are highly convenient for inheritance purposes. It is already estimated that EUR2-3bn are invested in Irish and Luxembourg-registered unit-linked policies of this type by high net worth Spanish investors. This remains modest compared with an estimated EUR26bn invested in Sicav funds.
