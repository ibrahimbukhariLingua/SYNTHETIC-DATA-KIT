Independent wealth managers’ association opens up to family offices


At its general shareholders’ meeting on 15 April, the German VuV association of independent wealth managers voted to agree to accept memberships from family offices. Family offices will receive the status of extraordinary members, and will have no voting rights, and no power to influence the association’s strategy. Currently, the VuV has about 200 members, about half of whom are independent wealth management firms in the country. Its managers have about EUR60bn in assets under management.
