Linedata and Morningstar Partner to Expand Fixed Income Coverage and Analytics


Linedata, the solutions provider dedicated to the investment management and credit industries, today announced that it is extending its partnership with Morningstar, Inc. in the area of fixed income and credit derivatives to include its Fund Services clients."As the search for returns in a difficult investment climate progresses, the investment management community is investing in diverse global fixed income products, requiring accounting systems to have robust and flexible asset coverage», said a press release. The growth of alternative mutual funds and the increase in popularity of direct lending in private equity type structures require accounting systems to meet this challenge. «As the global fixed income market becomes more complex and as more managers move to gain international exposure, dealing with these complexities can become quite a burden,» commented Todd Roitfarb, Head of Fixed Income Products at Morningstar.The partnership will provide expanded analytics to meet the requirements of alternative funds and SMA’s and enhances Linedata Admin Edge’s financial reporting capabilities, adding diversity to Linedata’s auditable client reporting. This will initially take the form of an integration between the Linedata Admin Edge fund administration platform and Morningstar’s BondPro library of fixed income and derivative analytics and accounting calculations. Linedata Admin Edge has built a significant client base who manages administration in the areas of fixed income and alternatives. The addition of BondPro will give those firms access to broader instrument coverage and greater agility in dealing with their associated calculations. Overall this means a faster time to market for new functionality and smoother automation.
