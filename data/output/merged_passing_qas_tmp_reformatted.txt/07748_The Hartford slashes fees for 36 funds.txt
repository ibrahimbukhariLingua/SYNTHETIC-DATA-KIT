The Hartford slashes fees for 36 funds


From 1 July, management commissions have been reduced for 36 products from The Hartford Mutual Funds (USD95.8bn as of 31 March). The asset management subsidiary of The Hartford has reduced fees for institutional, retirement and retail shares in the Diversified International, Fundamental Growth, Global Research, International Growth, International Opportunities and Value funds by 30 basis points. The objective is to put these funds in the foreground compared with their peers in their respective Morningstar categories, Keith Sloane, senior vice president at The Hartford Mutual Funds, announced on Wednesday. Fees have also been reduced by 15 basis points for institutional and retirement share classes in 30 other funds, with the goal of increasing institutional market share by targeting consultants and IFAs.
