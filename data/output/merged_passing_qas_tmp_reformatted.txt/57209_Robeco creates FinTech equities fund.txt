Robeco creates FinTech equities fund


Robeco has launched Robeco Global FinTech Equities. The fund invests in stocks of listed companies which benefit from the increasing digitization of the financial sector. Robeco Global FinTech Equities is a benchmark-agnostic fund and holds a concentrated portfolio of equities. Companies in the proprietary constructed investment universe will be part of one of the three following segments: today’s winners, Fintech enablers and challengers. Today’s winners include companies that already have a competitive advantage in this space, FinTech enablers include companies that facilitate the digitization trend, and challengers are the companies that could be the future winners. This spread across segments ensures that the fund is diversified over different drivers and risk characteristics.Patrick Lemmens, who also manages Robeco New World Financial Equities, and Jeroen van Oerle, both part of Robeco’s Trends Investing team are the portfolio managers of the fund.
