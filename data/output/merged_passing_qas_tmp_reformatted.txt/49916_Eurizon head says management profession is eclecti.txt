Asset management firms are never among the best places to work, however. According to the chairman of Assogestioni, the limited attractiveness of companies in the sector may be due to “aversion to finance, or because the sector focuses too much on individual talent, rather than on constructing groups.” Corcos feels it is important for executives in the asset management sector to build groups to which employees are proud to belong.
