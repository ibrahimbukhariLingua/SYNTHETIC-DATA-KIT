Risk management at the heart of hedge fund strategies


The 2008 financial crisis altered the behaviour of hedge funds in terms of risk management. A new study from the Managed Funds Association (MFA), BNY Mellon, and HedgeMark outlines new data showing that hedge funds are continuing to develop risk management practices that fit the needs of investors and fund managers alike.Managers of hedge funds have reinforced their internal controls with key recruitments, and considerably increased the amount of information released to investors on a regular basis. They have also made an effort to express their approach to risk management in comprehensible language, and are not hesitating to go into detail.The survey finds that 79% of firms now separate their risk manager and fund manager functions entirely to ensure independent oversight. More than 50% of participants estimate that independent verification of positions is an essential element in hedge fund surveillance.Institutional investors have welcomed the moves, and are not concealing their appetite for ongoing training in risk management. Efforts by hedge funds and professional associations are a step in the right direction, but need to be sustained in order not to be overtaken by developments in the sector.The survey finds that many hedge funds claim that practices put in place for risk management may generate alpha, and may allow them to stand out from the competition. In any case, reporting to investors will be produced on a daily or weekly basis for the next five years, compared with only 12% in 2007.
