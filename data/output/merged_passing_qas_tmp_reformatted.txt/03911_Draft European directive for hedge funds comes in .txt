Draft European directive for hedge funds comes in for criticism


In a letter sent on Monday to the chairman of the European Commission, the Socialist bloc in the European parliament claims that a draft European directive on hedge funds, which is up for a vote on 29 April, is ?ineffective? and ?full of loopholes,? Les Echos reports. The major fault with the bill pointed out by Socialists is that it singles out hedge fund managers, who would be required to register, rather than the funds themselves.
