French association in favour of creation of specialised ratings agencies for economic sectors


The French association of institutional investors (AF2I) has stated its position on proposed amendments to ratings agency regulations currently under consideration by the European parliament. While it is in favour of some proposals, such as the development of internal analysis, transparency standards for billing by agencies and measures to promote the issuance of unsolicited ratings, the AF2I disapproves of the principle of a required rotation of agencies, as their methodologies are not comparable, unlike account plans. The quality of the rating is closely tied to a very good long-term knowledge of issuers. The association also disapproves of the fact that a public regulatory authority should have the power to license, control and contest this or that point in global methodologies. This European particularism would appear not to make any sense on this point, to say nothing of the fact that it would run against intellectual freedom, the AF2I states, adding that it would prefer for the major ratings agenvies to continue to issue and widely distribute their methodologies, while also consulting on revisions to them. This is genuine progress, the AF2I claims, and hopes that the practice will become more established.
