Banif Inmobiliario: Courts order Santander to open its books


Judge Belén Sánchez has ordered the real estate fund management firm from Santander to provide the names of all investors who requested redemptions of their shares in the Banif Inmobiliario fund at its last liquidity window in October 2008, Expansión reports. 400 clients have accused the bank of first organising exits for some subscribers, who held 16.9% of assets in the fund, at a time when the net asset value of the fund was at record levels, before causing panic which led investors to demand redemptions of 80% of shares in the fund.
