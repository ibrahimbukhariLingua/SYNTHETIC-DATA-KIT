Heavy losses for AHL hedge fund from Man Group


The hedge fund AHL, from the alternative management firm Man Group, lost more than USD700m last week, the Financial Times reports. The fund, which has USD21.7bn in assets, lost 3.57% of its net assets between 18 and 22 January. The losses follow a tough year in 2009 for the fund, the only negative year it has had since its inception 23 years ago. Last month, AHL was already reporting weekly losses on the same scale (-4.3% in the first week of December). These losses are an embarrassment for Man, as the asset management firm is seeking to boost its assets. Man recently launched two UCITS versions of AHL open to retail investors.
