Two hedge funds face off over Herbalife


The hedge fund by Daniel Loeb on Wednesday announced that it holds an 8.2% stake in the food supplement firm Herbalife, valued at USD350m, the Wall Street Journal reports. At the same time, the fund from William Ackman, Pershing Square Capital Management, has bet more than USD1bn against the firm, short selling its shares. For observers, this could be shaping up to be one of the bloodiest hedge fund battles of all time.
