Gold boosts Paulson’s performance


More than a third of Paulson’s total assets under management, including John Paulson’s personal investments, are denominated in gold share classes, according to people familiar with the funds – a sign of concern about the risks of inflation, says the Financial Times. The gold class of Mr Paulson’s Advantage fund, which manages about USD7bn, is up approximately 6.7 per cent so far this year. However, the dollar-denominated Advantage share class is down 1.3 per cent.
