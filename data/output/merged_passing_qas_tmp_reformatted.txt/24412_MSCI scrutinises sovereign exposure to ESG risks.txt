MSCI scrutinises sovereign exposure to ESG risks


The index provider MSCI on 31 January announced the launch of a new service, MSCI ESG Sovereign Ratings, designed to identify a countryâ€™s exposure and its resulting management of environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, and estimate the long-term impact of these factors on the sustainable development of the country. By providing a long-term vision of the development of an economy, the new ratings service serves as a complement to traditional analysis of sovereign debt as an aspect of the solvency of a country.
