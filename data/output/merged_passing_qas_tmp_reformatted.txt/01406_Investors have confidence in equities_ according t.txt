Investors have confidence in equities, according to iShares


According to a survey of more than 300 professional investors by iShares in Germany and Austria, three quarters of respondents are convinced that equities will perform as well or better than bonds in 2010, and 74% feel that emerging markets will be in a better position than developed markets at the end of the recession. More than two thirds of those surveyed feel that 2010 will be a year of inflation, compared with only one third who predict deflation. Nearly 60% of managers surveyed predict that the Fed will be the first to raise its prime rates, followed by the ECB and the Bank of England. Dirk Klee, CEO of iShares for Germany, says these results corroborate the popularity on the markets of ETFs covering certain asset classes. 64% of the EUR41bn which have gone into ETFs in the past twelve months went to equities products. ETFs focused on certain emerging markets attracted EUR2.2bn, while funds focused on developed markets attracted a net total of EUR1.8bn. In the past six months, meanwhile, ETFs specialised in inflation-linked bonds saw net subscriptions of EUR1.1bn.
