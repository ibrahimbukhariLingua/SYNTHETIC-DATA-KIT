This is the first time since January 2006 that respondents are opting for a higher level of risk than their benchmarks, while cash allocations have fallen to an averge of 3.4%, their lowest levels since mid-2007, compared with 4% in December. Meanwhile, appetite for equities is strong, with a net total of 52% of asset allocators overweight in this asset class, compared with 37% in December. 55% of managers surveyed, meanwhile, have no protection in place against a fall in share prices in the next three months, compared with 48% in December. Investors are taking positions on cyclical equities and are optimistic about profit outlooks. Respondents estimate that Japanese equities are the most undervalued in the world, and 20% of specialists are planning to be overweight in this area this year, compared with 10% who are planning to be overweight in the Euro zone.
