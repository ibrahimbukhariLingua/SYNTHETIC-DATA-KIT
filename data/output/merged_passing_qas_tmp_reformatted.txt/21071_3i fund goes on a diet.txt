3i fund goes on a diet


Simon Borrows, the new CEO of 3i, is seeking to bring a fresh start to the veteran British private equity firm, closing six offices and cutting staff at six more, Les Echos reports. One third of all jobs at the firm will be affected. Fundraising has been extended for one year to the end of 2013. The share price of 3i has fallen by more than 80% in five years.
