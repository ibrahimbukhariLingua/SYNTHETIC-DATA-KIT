CapHorn Invest opens new chapter in United States


CapHorn Invest is recruiting in the US market. The fund, specialised in investment in European B-to-B digital startups, yesterday announced the recruitment of Philippe Finkelstein as venture partner in New York. His role will be to “accelerate growth in the fund’s partnerships in the US market, and particularly the East coast,” the firm says in a statement. The recruitment comes at the time of the final closing of the second fund from the firm with EUR130m, bringing total assets under management to EUR180m. Filnkelstein is the former CEO and founder of the Altavia group, founded in 1988, an independent international commercial group dedicated to retail, and in 2009 founder of the Cross Border Network. Finkelstein has been based in New York for 12 years, and is also an investor in CapHorn Invest, with solid knowledge of the US ecosystem. “He also brings the fund and its participations access to decision-makers and leaders at top businesses,” says CapHorn Invest. “This recruitment marks an important step in the development of CapHorn Invest, opening new opportunities in North America,” says Damien Bourel, co-founder of CapHorn Invest, in a statement. As the second fund closes, about 100 new investing directors have joined the CapHorn Business Club, bringing it to 250 members. These include Veronique Di Benedetto, vice president for France at Econocom, Chantal Baudron, director of the same firm, specialised in the recruitment of top directors; Bernard Attali, director of SFR, Bruno Lanthier, former chairman and CEO of Truffaut; Jacques Vincent, former COO of Danone, and Thibaut Bechetoille, chairman and CEO of Qosmos. 12 investments have already been made with the second fund. CapHorn Invest now assists more than 20 SMBs which it deems to have strong potential.
