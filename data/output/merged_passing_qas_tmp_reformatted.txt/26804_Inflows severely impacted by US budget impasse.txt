Inflows severely impacted by US budget impasse


The budget impasse in the United States drove investors away from all US asset classes in the first few days of October. Retail outflows from Us equities reached levels not seen in nearly six months. Europe, Japan, and to a lesser extent China, profited from this development, but not to the extent of offsetting the massive redemptions observed in the United States.In the week to 9 October, equity funds overall posted a net outflow of USD6.45bn, according to statistics communicated by EPFR Global. European equity funds, however, continued to attract investors, while Japanese equity funds have posted a net inflow of over USD1bn for the third time in five weeks.Bond funds finished the week with redemptions of USD1.82bn. European bond funds attracted nearly USD800m, one third of which went to Spanish bond funds.Money market funds, for their part, saw outflows of USD23.3bn.
