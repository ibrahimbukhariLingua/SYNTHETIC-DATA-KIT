AdvisorShares prepares for interest rates to rise again


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } With the AdvisorShares Treesdale Rising Rates ETF, the asset management firm Advisor Shares has applied to the SEC for a license for an actively-managed ETF designed to confront a potential rise in interest rates, with Treesdale Partners as its sub-adviser, Index Universe reports. The average duration will be -5 to -15 years, which will be partly offset by long positions on Treasurys, interest rate swaps, and other products. The fund aims to generate improved returns in an environment of rising interest rates, by investing primarily in MBS with interest-only cash flows, interest-only swaps, and certain mortgage derivatives. For its part, Treesdale will retain the negative duration of the portfolio by investing in US Treasury bonds and other liquid fixed income instruments.The new fund will carry the acronym HDGB and have its primary listing on the NYSE Arca platform.
