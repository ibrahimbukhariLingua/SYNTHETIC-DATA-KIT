German tax authorities have reportedly bought other CDs of banking information


Several CDs containing banking information from Swiss firms are reported to have been bought up by the tax authorities of the German region of North Rhine-Westphalia, the German press reports. Financial Times Deutschland (FTD) claims there are two CDs, one of which concerns clients at the bank UBS, while the Süddeutsche Zeitung claims there are four CDs. The Bavarian newspaper cites an “expert connected with the case,” who says information on the CDs, concerning German citizens who have attempted to defraud German tax authorities with Swiss bank accounts, is “extremely interesting.” A source familiar with the matter tells FTD that the CD containing data stolen from UBS is “heavy,” as it contains evidence of the use of foundations to help German clients avoid taxes, and also includes “known names.” In addition to the data in the strict sense, the German authorities are also thought to have obtained internal training documents from UBS, which demonstrate that it actively helped its clients evade taxes.
