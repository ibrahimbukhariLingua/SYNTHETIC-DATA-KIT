Family offices invest 26% of their portfolios in hedge funds


Family offices donâ€™t like funds of funds much. They invest 26% of their portfolios in hedge funds, but only 1% in funds of funds, according to a survey by Infovest21 of a sample of family offices, mostly based in the United States, during July. Fees have not a demonstrable influence on the opinions of family offices about funds of funds, which nonetheless charge lower commissions than hedge funds (management commissions of 1%, instead of 1.6% for hedge funds, and performance commissions of 7.8% rather than 18.9%). Nearly 60% of family offices say that their commissions have held stable since last year, while 20% say that commissions have been lowered, and 20% that outperformance commissions have fallen. On average, family office managers have stakes in 23 hedge funds. Though they differ as to the primary purpose of these funds (absolute returns, risk reduction, diversification), family offices generally have a highly favourable opinion of hedge funds (two thirds). Only 4% have a negative opinion of them. The preferred products of family offices are long/short equities and event-driven products, as well as emerging markets strategies.
