Convictions AM launches a new multi-factoral management product range


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Convictions Asset Management is launching an asset management product range for its internal multi-factoral asset class and asset allocation analysis model. The new range comes in addition to the current range, based primarily on analysis of indicators drawn from the proprietary multi-factoral model. As Pierre Hervé, director of management at Convictions AM, explains, “the model seeks to detect forming trends in the market, to take into account volatility regimes and their irregularities and potential for downturns on the markets.” The model “aims to place sensors on the market which can tell whether there is a risk or not,” says Hervé. This model which focuses as a priority on fluctuations on asset prices on the market, in order to establish a ranking with grades for each asset class. “Then, good exposure to the market needs to be selected, and asset classes and themes need to be selected to construct a portfolio,” says Hervé. The new range will be constructed around both a definition of the overall exposure and detection of underlying themes to be preferred. The construction of the portfolios will be established according to performance objectives and predefined risk constraints, expressed as maximum drawdown and expected recovery delays. The new modelled multi-factoral asset management product range will bring the launch of two funds, and a mandated asset management product range calibrated with investors. It may take the form of flexible asset allocation, or, as part of predefined asset allocation, prefers the selection of sub-asset classes and underlyings (funds, ETFs, etc.) “This new product range is aimed both at institutional investors subject to new management constraints, and to private investors, for whom it is perfectly appropriate for the context and their objectives,” says Convictions AM.
