Aviva Investors France innovates in several areas


Nearly two years after Jean-François Boulier became chairman of the board at Aviva Investors France (AIF; see Newsmanagers of 15 September 2009), the asset management firm has begun offering its expertise as a manager to external clients, and is no longer a captive management firm for the insurer. Boulier says that “external development does not work to the detriment of Aviva, which also encourages us to innovate more.” In 2010, AIF posted an increase of an undisclosed size to its operating profits, at a time when the Aviva Investors group itself saw losses of GBP100m, compared with GBP115m in 2009 (see Newsmanagers of 4 March).In terms of products, there have been many innovations, with the Aviva Investors Obligations Variables fund, to confront rising interest rates and a flattening of the curve. In the area of emerging market debt, the GBP750m inflation-linked local currencies emerging markets bond fund (see Newsmanagers of 28 January 2011) will be brought into compliance with the UCITS III directive next month. AIF has also received a management mandate from the Philips pension fund for its real estate investments; the group also manages an absolute return real estate fund with no liability constraint (Return Enhanced Asset Liability Management, or REALM).The firm is also planning to add a credit product and an emerging market debt product, probably in local currencies, to its five existing absolute return strategies. In organisational terms, Boulier has announced that an international platform within Aviva Investors will become available by the end of 2012, which will make it possible to manage capital independently of the expertise and location of managers, which will also facilitate increasing sales of unit-linked shares. The process of setting up the platform will take two years, with risk management, portfolio management and position control as areas of focus.Meanwhile, the geographical reach of Aviva Investors Europe has grown from seven to twelve countries, with new offices opening in Germany, a first installation in the Netherlands, one in progress in Switzerland (private banks and international distributors) and a push into Scandinavia, beginning with Sweden.
