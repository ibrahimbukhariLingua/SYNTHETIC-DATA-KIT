The former chief executive of Credit Suisse Asset Management UK, David Norman, is launching a new asset management firm, which will seek to ride the wave of growing investor demand for inexpensive multi-asset class investment products, Money Marketing reports. Norman has teamed up with the founder of Folio Partners, Gary Mairs, to launch the new asset management firm, entitled TCF Fund Managers. TCF will initially offer a low-price fund management service, which will serve independent financial advisers (IFAs) and pension funds.

Portfolios may include British and global equities, including emerging markets, fixed income, cash, commodities, and real estate.
