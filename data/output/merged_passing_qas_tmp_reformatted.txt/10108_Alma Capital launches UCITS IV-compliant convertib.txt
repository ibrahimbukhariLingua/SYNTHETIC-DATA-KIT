Alma Capital launches UCITS IV-compliant convertibles fund


Shenkman Capital Management will manage the Alma US Convertible Fund, a new sub-fund of the Luxembourg Sicav Alma Capital Investment Funds which complies with the UCITS IV directive. The asset management firm for the fund is La Française AM International in Luxembourg.The objective for the diversified portfolio of convertible bonds in US dollars is to outperform the benchmark, the BofA/ML All US Convertibles ex. Mandatory Index (V0A0). Unlike other convertible strategies, Shenkman Capital approaches convertibles from a credit perspective, and seeks convertibles which are trading near their «bond floor», with the objective of reselling them when they dispaly excessive equity sensivity. The fund offers weekly liquidity; it is available in US dollars and in hedged euros. The management commission is 1% for the institutional share class.
