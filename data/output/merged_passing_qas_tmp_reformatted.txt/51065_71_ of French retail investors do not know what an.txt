71% of French retail investors do not know what an asset management firm is


Asset management firms will need to improve their communications to the general public, according to the second edition of a study of 20,000 retail investors in 28 countries by Schroders. 63% of respondents do not know what an asset management firm does. Many people confuse them in particular with financial advisers or investment banks. This finding is even more severe in France, where 71% of respondents say they do not know what an asset management firm is. The study also finds that 51% of respondents worldwide think they have better understanding of investments than the average investor, “which suggests an excess of confidence,” the authors of the study write. In France, 48% think so. The study was conducted online on behalf of Schroders by Research Plus ltd, between 30 March and 25 April 2016, and covered 20,000 investors based in 28 countries. In the meaning of the survey, an investor is any person planning to invest at least EUR10,000 (or equivalent) over the next 12 months, and who have modified their investments in the past five years.
