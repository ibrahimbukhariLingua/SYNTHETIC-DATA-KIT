F&amp;C acquires Thames River Capital


The British management firm F&C has acquired its competitor Thames River Capital. The sale, for an estimated GBP53.6m, or EUR62m, is expected to be completed in third quarter this year, and is a sign that the management firm has ambitions to become a multi-specialist business. An initial payment of GBP33.6m has already been made, and a further GBP20m will be paid if Thames River Capital achieves certain profit objectives in 2011 and 2012. F&C will finance the acquisition through a capital increase, as well as from cash reserves and credit.
