Invesco Perpetual adds to multi-asset class team


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Invesco Perpetual is adding to its multi-asset class range with the launch of the Invesco Perpetual Global Targeted Income fund, which aims for gross returns 3.5% higher than the British Libor over three months, as well as for the preservation of capital under all market conditions over a three-year cycle. The fund will also make an effort to limit volatility to less than half the volatility observed for international equities over the same three-year cycle. The fund will be led by David Millar, and will be managed jointly by Richard Batty, Sebastian Mackay and Gwilym Stachell, who will have the support of seven other members of the multi-asset team at Invesco Perpetual. The fund will invest in 20 to 30 investment ideas at all times over a horizon of two to three years.
