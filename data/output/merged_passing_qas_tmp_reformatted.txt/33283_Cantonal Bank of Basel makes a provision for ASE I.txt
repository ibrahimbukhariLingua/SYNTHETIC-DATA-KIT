Cantonal Bank of Basel makes a provision for ASE Investment


The Cantonal Bank of Basel (Basler Kantonalbank, BKB) has decided to make a provision of CHF50m to cover potential criminal charges in relation to a lawsuit connected with the wealth management firm ASE Investment AG. In this case, about 500 clients lost money which was indirectly invested with BKB. The provision will be written down on the 2012 balance sheet, according to a statement released on 3 January by the cantonal bank. “Neither ASE Investment nor its organs will be in a position to cover these losses,” the cantonal bank says. “BKB will make an effort, within the means and responsibilities of each, to find solutions in this case.” A contribution of CHF50m will be made to reserves for general banking risks. This will have the effect of reducing operating profits by this amount, as well as interim profits for BKB’s parent company. Gross profits and consolidated annual profits will remain unaffected. A previous report states that losses for former clients of ASE Investment who had relationships with BKB total over CHF100m. The former CEO of BKB, Hans Rudolf Matter, resigned in October 2012, in the wake of the scandal.
