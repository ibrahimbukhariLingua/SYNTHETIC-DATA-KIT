Madoff: Report points to failures at SEC


According to an internal study by the Securities and Exchange Commission made public on Wednesday, 2 September, edited by inspector David Kotz, the US market regulatory authority could have uncovered the fraud perpetrated by Bernard Madoff much sooner, the Financial Times reports. Though eight complaints had been lodged against the financier since 1992, a lack of experience on the part of personnel at the SEC prevented the agency from noticing the warning signs, the report states.
