SEC regulates ratings agencies


On its website, La Tribune reports that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will take measures to create a stricter regulatory framework for ratings agencies such as Moody’s Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor’s, which are accused of having played a major role in the financial crisis by granting high ratings to high-risk products. The agencies will be required to increase transparency and will now have the right to demand detailed information about certain products. Other measures will aim to encourage competition between the ratings agencies and avoid conflicts of interest.
