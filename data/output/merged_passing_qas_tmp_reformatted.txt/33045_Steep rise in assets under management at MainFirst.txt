Steep rise in assets under management at MainFirst AM


As of 31 December, assets at the German asset management firm Mainfirst Asset Management topped EUR3bn, a record, compared with EUR1.1bn twelve months previously. The firm declined to tell Newsmangers the respective level of assets under management in eight open-ended funds and in mandates; the distribution appears to be about 50/50, according to some sources familiar with the matter. The largest fund from the Frankfurt-based asset management firm is the Mainfirst Top European Ideas Fund, with about EUR1.3bn.Mainfirst AM did not wish to provide details about net subscription levels either. A statement says merely that the product range grew in 2012 with the addition of a quantitative equity strategy, the MainFirst North America fund (managed by a former Swisscanto manager), two bond strategies, including the MainFirst Emerging Markets Corporate Bond Fund Balanced (managed by former Clariden Leu managers), the recruitment of a team from Postbank Financial Services (which will bring out a new fund this year), and lastly, the creation of a multi-asset class unit. For the latter, Mainfirst has already applied for sales licenses for three open-ended absolute return funds, which will be managed by a team recruited from DB Advisors.
