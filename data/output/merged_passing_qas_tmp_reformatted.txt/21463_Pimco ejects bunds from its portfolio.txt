Pimco ejects bunds from its portfolio


Andrew Bosomworth, CEO of Pimco for Germany, announced in early June that the US asset management firm no longer held more than a negligible exposure to German federal government bonds (bunds) in its portfolio, not so much because the returns on these securities has fallen as because the level of fiscal risk (in light of the European rescue) reduces their quality, Fondsprofessionell reports.Meanwhile, the cash allocation for open-ended funds ranges from 5% to 15%, while the percentage before the crisis was only 1% to 5%.
