Insurers remain engaged with private equity


Nearly two thirds of insurers are planning to make new invesrtments in private equity by the end of this year, according to a study undertaken by Preqin, covering a sample of 55 insurers who are already present in the asset class. At the same time, 22% of insurers are not committed to a sate, while 16% are not planning further allocations to the asset class until 2014. Despite forthcoming regulatory changes included in the Colvency 2 directive, most insurers (79%) have not modified their exposure to private equity. According to one US insurer, US regulations :have not affected our level of investment in private equity, but has affected some strategies and complicates our work.” The study also finds that nearly one third of insurers (30%) are currently below their allocation objectives for the asset class, and 88% of them are planning to maintain or increase their exposure to private equity over the longer term. 51% of insurers find that Europe, which is facing a crisis whose end is still not in sight, represents an attractive region for private equity investment, followed by the United States (45%) and Asia (16%). Preqin reports that 60% of companies have allocations to the asset class over USD250m.
