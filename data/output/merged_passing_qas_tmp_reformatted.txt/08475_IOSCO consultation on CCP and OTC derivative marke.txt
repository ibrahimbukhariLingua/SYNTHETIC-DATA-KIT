IOSCO consultation on CCP and OTC derivative market databases


The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the technical committee of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) on 12 May published two consultation documents which lay out proposals to strengthen the OTC derivative market. The first report offers a series of recommendations concerning central counterparties (CCP), entitled “Guidance on the application of the 2004 CPSS-IOSCO Recommendations for Central Counterparties to OTC derivatives CCPs.” The second report, entitled “Considerations for trade repositories in OTC derivatives markets,” treats the question of databases. “The two complementary series of high-level recommendations represent a significant response by CPSS and IOSCO to the recent financial crisis. They also reflect the recommendations of the G20 on strengthening the over-the-counter derivatives markets,” the president of the CPSS, William Dudley, and the president of the IOSCO technical committee, Kathleen Casey, say in a statement. Interested parties are invited to submit their remarks until 25 June.
