ESG Now the Norm in European Funds, according to Cerulli


The stampede to address environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns has left European fund managers running faster to stand still, according to the latest issue of The Cerulli Edge - European Monthly Product Trends.Cerulli Associates, a global research and consulting firm, notes that, in response to the surge in demand, both asset management firms and the companies in which funds invest have raised their game."Soft power, to some extent facilitated by social media, is putting ever more pressure on companies to do the right thing, such as pay their taxes and not pollute. Sometimes, there is clearly no conflict between profit and morality,» says Barbara Wall, Europe managing director at Cerulli.Cerulli notes that a raft of data and research--including Deutsche Asset Management’s meta-study--has emerged that goes a long way to allay investors’ concerns that ESG funds carry too high a price in terms of performance.One remaining hindrance is the absence of universally agreed definitions of terms such as sustainability. Also, investors’ priorities differ, as Wall explains: «Managers tell Cerulli that some clients want to emphasize the E, some are interested in the S, and some the G. Just as fund managers do not agree on the best shares to buy, no one can agree on exactly how to score ESG.»
