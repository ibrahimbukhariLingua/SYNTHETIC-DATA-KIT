Europe - D. Dudding (Threadneedle European Select Fund) bets on health


Dave Dudding, manager of the Threadneedle European Select Fund, is sticking to a defensive approach to the management of his portfolio. Given the high volatility of the markets, he is staying concentrated on defensive sectors, such as basic consumer goods and health care, the management firm says in a release. The fund is still considerably underweight on the financial sector, while Nestlé is currently one of the manager’s top picks.
