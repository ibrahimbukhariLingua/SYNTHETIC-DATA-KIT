Pictet turns agriculture fund into nutrition fund


Pictet is changing the name of its Pictet-Agriculture fund, to adopt the name Pictet-Nutrition, to accompany the evolution of the product.The strategy now aims “to exploit opportunities generated throughout the food industries, on the basis of pronounced overarching trends, such as sustainable development, demography, and a growing interest in healthy lifestyles.”At its launch in 2009, the objective of the Pictet-Agriculture fund was to invest in companies which derive their growth from activities throughout the food production chain, from farm to table: seeds, fertilisers, equipment, technologies, tests and certification, quality foods, logistics, etc. The fund had a positive orientation, which aims to benefit from solutions and not problems: it does not invest in commodities and does not speculate on shortages of foodstuffs.In the past 2-3 years, the management of the fund has evolved, toward a reduction in the seeds and fertilisers segment, more cyclical and correlated to soft commodities, with an increase in segments related to nutrition (logistics, packaging, quality foods, etc.) Currently, for example, the fund no longer holds positions in fertilisers. However, it is profiting from the positive orientation of the quality foods sector.The fund is now more oriented to quality foods and to improving distribution networks (quality control, sustainable or bio agriculture.)The name change is accompanied by a reduction in the proportion of cyclical stocks in the portfolio, since the fund invests less in companies which operate in the food production industries.The investment process and the management team, composed of Cédric Lecamp and Gertjan van der Geer, remain unchanged.The investment universe is divided into three major areas, covering the full value chain: agricultures of the future (high tech agriculture and precision agriculture, which improve the health of crops and animals), processing and logistics (companies which optimise the process delivering nutrition to the plate, by improving access to nutrition, increasing efficiency and minimising waste), and foods (companies active in the development of high quality food products, either through better ingredients, seasoning, or testing and quality control activities.)
