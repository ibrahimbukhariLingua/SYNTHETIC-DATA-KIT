United States - Pimco pays dividends suspended by closed funds


Pacific Investment Management Co (Pimco, Allianz group) has announced that its closed funds Corporate Income and Corporate Opportunity would pay dividends on Friday which had been delayed due to the depreciation of auction-rate securities (ARS) in their portfolio, the Wall Street Journal reports. The High Income Fund already paid out its dividend on Thursday. The three funds, and the Floating Rate Strategy Fund, have announced that they will honour dividend payments slated for 3 April. In all four cases, redemptions of ARS by Pimco will begin on 30 March. ARS redemptions for the fifth closed fund, which has announced the suspension of its dividend for April, will begin on 1 April. The fund has not yet stated when it will reopen.
