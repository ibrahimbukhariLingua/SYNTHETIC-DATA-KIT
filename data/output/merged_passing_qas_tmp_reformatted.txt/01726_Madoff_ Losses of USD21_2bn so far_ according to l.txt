Madoff: Losses of USD21.2bn so far, according to liquidator


Les Echos reports that the first accounts published in New York on 28 October by the American liquidator Irving Picard, charged with unwinding the Madoff funds, show that the provisional net losses for half of the 4,900 active clients on the books total USD21.2bn, so far, compared with an initial estimate that the fraud totalled USD64.5bn, largely based on an assumption that fictive accounts submitted by the broker were genuine. To date, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), an entity that reimburses investors when a brokerage firm goes bankrupt, has disbursed USD534m, on total declared claims of USD4.43bn, from 2,860 direct clients.
