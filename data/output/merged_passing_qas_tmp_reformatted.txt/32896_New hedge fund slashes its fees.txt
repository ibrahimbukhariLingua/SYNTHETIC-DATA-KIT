New hedge fund slashes its fees


The hedge fund Core Macro, founded by Cantab Capital in Cambridge, has reduced its fees from 0.5% of capital invested each year and 10% of gains, compared with a standard rate of 2% and 20% in the sector, the Financial Times reports. The fund uses the same strategies as Man Group, Winton Capital and BlueCrest. The FT reports that hedge funds will need to revise their fee structures in coming years, under pressure from institutional investors.
