ESMA continues work on “closet indexing”


The European securities markets authority (ESMA) on 2 February released a statement which describes work in progress concerning the phenomenon of ‘closet indexing,’ meaning funds which claim to be actively-managed, but which are managed rather as index-tracking funds, with the sole objective of tracking an index as closely as possible. This practice runs a risk of causing damages for investors, since the service or risk/return profile which they had been expecting is not really implemented, though they are paying higher commissions than those charged for passive management.ESMA studied a sample of 2,600 funds over the period 2012-2014 to determine whether indications made it possible to identify this closet indexing phenomenon throughout Europe. The quantitative data, such as the percentage of a UCITS portfolio which does not correspond to the underlying equity benchmark indicator, suggest that about 5% to 15% of UCITS format equity funds are likely to meet the definition of a ‘closet’ fund. ESMA then reviewed the documentation for the funds concerned, to check their management strategy, and were able to observe that the documentation appeared to confirm the results of quantitative analysis.“The protection of invetors is at the heart of our mission and the first conclusions raise questions which deserve a deeper analysis. Fund managers need to provide investors with honest and clear information which does not mislead them. In partnership with national regulators, we are going to study this issue more closely,” says Steven Maijoor, chairman of ESMA, cited in a statement.
