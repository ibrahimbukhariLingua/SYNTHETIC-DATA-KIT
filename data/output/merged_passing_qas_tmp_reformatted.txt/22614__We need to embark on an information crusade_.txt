“We need to embark on an information crusade”


Newsmanagers: What changes does BlackRock plan to bring about in the behaviour of investment managers and savers? Alex Hoctor-Duncan: When they talk about funds, all professionals have an annoying tendency to systematically criticise what is not good in products. This is not constructive. From our point of view, we would like to help investors understand that it is time to rethink the basis on which their portfolio is built. We would also like to help savers to understand the new opportunities open to them. Currently, to make a long story short, savers are long on cash and bonds. We need to convince them to modify the composition of their portfolios in order to integrate more flexibility in the way they view certain asset classes. Newsmangers: Does that mean that BlackRock has investment vehicles that meet those criteria? Alex Hoctor-Duncan: Yes, we have released corresponding products, in our dividend funds. We are also offering them “extension” funds (BSF Asia and Emerging Markets Extension), and absolute returns in the BSF European & American Diversified Equity Absolute Return. As a complement, BlackRock offers bricks of bets which are both cheaper and faster in terms of execution, in the iShares ETFs. Everything clearly depends on the relevance of the underlying index. Newsmanagers: It is clear that businesses have long-term financing needs. But are retail investors facing the same issues? Alex Hoctor-Duncan: Beyond products, the important thing is for savings investors to be made aware of what insurers call “longevity risks.” Remember that one in two 65-year-old people will live another 27 and a half years, statistically. Investors therefore need to modify their portfolios and accept a little more risk, or else at age 80 they will be in need.
