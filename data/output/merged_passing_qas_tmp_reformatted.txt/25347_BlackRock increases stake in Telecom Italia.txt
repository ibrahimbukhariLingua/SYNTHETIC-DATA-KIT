BlackRock increases stake in Telecom Italia


The asset management giant BlackRock on 16 December announced that it has increased its stake in Telecom Italia, in which it now controls 7.789% of voting rights. In a statement, the US group says that it holds EUR183m in convertible bonds in addition, which correspond to a stake of 1.639%.Documents from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Wall Street market watchdog, reveal that BlackRockâ€™s stake has increased from 5.1% as of the end of October to 10.1% as of the end of November. On Sunday, Consob, the Italian stock market regulator, announced that it may fine BlackRock for failing to report, as regulations in Italy would have required it to report investments above a 10% threshold. BlackRock explains that it did not inform Consob or Telecom Italia since its voting rights were below 10%.
