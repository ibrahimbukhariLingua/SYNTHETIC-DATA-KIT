FSB plans to reduce structural weakness in asset management sector


The Financial Stability Board (FSB) on 22 June published a consultation document which aims to present recommendations to remedy structural weaknesses in asset management activities (“Proposed Policy Recommendations to Adddress Structural Vulnerabilities from Asset Management Activities.”) The document, which is open for consultation until 21 September next year, defines 14 recommendations which are expected to help confront structural weaknesses which may represent potential risks to financial stability.Issues related to a liquidity “mismatch” between open investment funds (including ETFs but not money market funds) and the terms of reimbursement for the various sub-funds of these funds, and the leverage used by all types of funds, are considered the most significant points of vulnerability, the document emphasizes. The other two chapter headings highlighted by the FSB are operational risks, which focuses primarily on asset management firms which are larger, more complex or which offer critical services, and securities lending activities at asset management firms, which concetrates in particular on terms relating to indemnity paid to clients.The recommendations proposed by the FSB are designed to give the supervisory authorities and asset management firms the tools and data to allow them to detect and treat the risks identified. In connection with the publication from the FSB, the international organisation of securities commissions (IOSCO) on 22 June also released a note discussing their initiative concerning the priorities to be taken into account to address data deficits in the asset management sector.The Council is planning to finalize its recommendations by the end of the year, several of which will be implemented by IOSCO.
