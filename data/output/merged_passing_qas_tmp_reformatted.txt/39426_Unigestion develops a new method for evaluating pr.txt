Unigestion develops a new method for evaluating private equity risk


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } As part of a recent research project undertaken in collaboration with the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Unigestion, which has about EUR10.9bn in assets under management, has developed a new method for evaluationg private equity risks. The innovative approach has two essential specificities: on the one hand, it is based on real cash flows from private equity funds and not, as often, on their intermediary valuations; on the other, it defines risk as the difference between the real level and the expected level of cash flows, both in terms of horizons and amounts. In other words, it evaluates risk the risk that private equity fund distribution presents to investors as lower or later than expected. Unigestion has thus set up a risk measurement known as Expected Cumulative Downside Absolute Deviation (ECDAD), which is based on fund cash flows.
