The report details the ways in which the firm exercises its influence to achieve better awareness of sustainable development challenges on financial markets The report refers to actions implemented by Mirova over all the asset classes it manages (equities, bonds, infrastructure) and all market actors: the financial markets, regulators, and businesses. Since 2014, Mirova has set up its own collaborative platform, constructed of Mirova experts and representatives of its clients, which offers Mirova and its partners influential leverage via close dialogue with businesses about their most controversial practices. The first two collaborative engagement initiatives of the platform have been launched to deal with current themes. On the one hand, the management of risks in the supply chain in the IT and communications sector, and in the textile sector, where price competition is leading to numerous excesses; and on the other, offshore Arctic exploration, where environmental and financial risks are insufficiently taken into account in a context of restricted carbon budget. These first two initiatives are supported by 32 institutional investors, and are targeting 16 businesses whose practices are considered deficient. The collaborative engagement platform at Mirova has given itself 3 years to achieve improvement in practices or changes of strategy at target businesses. Mirova will launch its third collaborative engagement initiative on the theme of financing a transition to a low carbon economy in January 2016.
