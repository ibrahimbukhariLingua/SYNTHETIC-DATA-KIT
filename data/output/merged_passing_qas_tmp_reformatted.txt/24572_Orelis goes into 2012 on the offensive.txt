Orelis goes into 2012 on the offensive


Franceâ€™s Orelis group, which calls itself a wholesaler aimed at independent financial advisers, and more recently, life insurance brokers, is hitting the ground running in 2012. This follows a year in 2011 in which the firm exceeded its objectives, with a total of EUR118m in newly-insured capital, of which 80% are unit-linked savings, in contrast with the market, which took on 85% euro contracts, and 15% unit-linked. In order to meet demand from partners and also, potentially, to compete with rivals, the group is offering a range of secure solutions in 2012 for life insurance and retirement planning product ranges, and is launching a range of funds in euros and a real estate platform to provide access to a wide range of programmes, promoters and tax incentives.
