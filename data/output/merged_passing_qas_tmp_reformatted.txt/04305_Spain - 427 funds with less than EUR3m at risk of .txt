Spain - 427 funds with less than EUR3m at risk of closure


Expansión reports that 427 investment funds currently have assets of less than EUR3m, the minimum established by the CNMV. If they cannot bring their assets above this level within one year after falling below it, they may be liquidated at the order of the regulator. The only exception to the EUR3m is a 6-month extension for newly-launched funds. Between November 2008 and February 2009, the number of funds in Spain fell from 3,060 to 2,881. In addition, there are about 300 funds with total assets of EUR3m-EUR5m, which are therefore vulnerable if the market continues its downward trajectory.Average assets under management are EUR60m in Spain, compared with EUR160m elsewhere in Europe, and more than EUR1bn in North America. And 10% of funds worldwide are Spanish, although they account for only 2% of assets.About half of all the funds with less than EUR3m in assets come from only 10 promoters, of whom Ahorro Corporación (57), La Caixa (45) and Santander (29) top the list.
