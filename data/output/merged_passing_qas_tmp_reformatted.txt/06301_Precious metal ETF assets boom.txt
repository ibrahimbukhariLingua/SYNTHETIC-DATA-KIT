Precious metal ETF assets boom


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Investors are flocking to ETFs specialised in precious metals, and assets in the SPDR Gold Shares fund from State Street total nearly USD60bn, The Wall Street Journal reports, adding that the fund owns more gold than all the central banks in the world save five. The iShares Gold Trust (BlackRock), with USD4.8bn, has gained a lot of assets since it split its shares on a 10-to-1 basis, which appears to prove that retail investors are flocking to the previous metals ETF segment at a time when there is a major risk of a correction.The iShares Silver Trust, for its part, has seen a 15% increase in the number of shares since 1 September, and has USD9.6bn in assets. Among the other ETFs with less than USD1bn in assets are the ETFS Physical Gold Shares from ETF Securities and the Sprott Physical Gold Trust. For silver, there are also the ETFS Silver Trust and the Powershares DB Silver Shares (Invesco).The ETFS Physical Platinum Shares and Physical Palladium Shares were launched this year, and made a very good start in terms of inflows.
