High net worth private investors prepare for exodus from SICAVs


The Spanish government is planning to severely toughen the tax policies applicable to SICAV funds, the preferred vehicle of high net worth families, which represent assets of EUR26bn, Expansi√≥n reports. These high net worth parties have already begun exploring alternatives. It is now possible to merge a SICAV with a normal investment fund, which would avoid closure fees. But there is also the solution in which the fund is liquidated, which would be fiscally less of a problem as many SICAVs accumulated latent capital losses during the market crisis. Lastly, there is the possibility of transferring the capital to Luxembourg funds.
