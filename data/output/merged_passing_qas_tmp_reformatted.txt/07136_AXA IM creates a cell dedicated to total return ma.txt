AXA IM creates a cell dedicated to total return management


Axa IM announced on 24 September that it has created a cell dedicated to total return management, “in a market context which remains volatile, so as to meet the growing needs of clients for capital preservation and stable returns.” A team will be assembled in the next few weeks, which will report to Serge Pizem, currently head of management teams at Axa Framlingon in Paris.The team will initially take over the Optimal Income range from AXA Framlington, whose characteristics are similar to total return type products which will subsequently be developed, which will be based on all possible sources of financial performance creation, including stock-picking. To do this, it will rely on all the shared expertise at AXA IM, including research, product management and distribution. The new structure will include the teams led by Thibaud de Vitry, head of Investment Solutions expertise at AXA Investment Managers. Pizem will be leaving Axa Framlington, and Mark Beveridge, global head of the expertise area, will now directly manage the Paris teams.
