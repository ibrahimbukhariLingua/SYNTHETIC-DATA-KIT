Strong growth in asset management at Avenir Finance


Avenir Finance announced on Monday, 11 February that in the 2009 fiscal year it made earnings of EUR27.6m, a slight increase over 2008. In detail, asset management and distribution rose strongly, by 37% and 15%, respectively. The asset management firm attributes the good results in asset management to the success of mutual funds managed by Avenir Finance Investment Managers (particularly the Absolute Return AFIM OFP range), whose assets have increased 76%. In addition to this, the firm reports good results in distribution, with growth for the sales force and major accounts. The Avenir Finance group is planning to focus its growth in private management and asset management in the next few years, a statement from the firm says.
