Banking confidentiality estimated to account for 8% to 14% of the value of a bank


Between 8% and 14% of a Swiss bankâ€™s value depends on banking confidentiality, Agefi Switzerland reports. These are the findings of a university study published in the March issue of Financial Markets and Portfolio Management, covering a limited sample of four establishments (UBS, Credit Suisse, Julius Baer and Vontobel). Another finding is that banking confidentiality is mostly not appreciated for taxation reasons, but rather in order to protect individual privacy. The authors, one bank director and two professors in Zurich, find that the value of a management bank may be measured in the absence of banking confidentiality, and the value of confidentiality may be added to this, weighted according to the likelihood that confidentiality will be preserved.
