FTSE to include MaxDiv indices from Tobam in its product range


On 6 June, FTSE Group announced that it has signed a partnership with Tobam which will result in the inclusion of the “maximum diversification” (MaxDiv) range of indices from the Paris-based firm in the range of indices not weighted by cap size from the FTSE group. The Tobam indices offer investors an approach which may avoid concentration risks that cap-weighted strategies are subject to. Assets in “Anti-Benchmark” funds from Tobiam total USD1.8bn, and Yves Choueifaty, chairman, says that assets under management at the firm have increased by more than 30% since the beginning of the year.
