Henderson to recruit for Credit Alpha team


Stephen Tharyan, head of credit at Henderson Global Investors, has announced at a presentation in Paris on Monday that for the moment, the exposure of the Credit Alpha absolute return long/short fund (GBP510m) to US high yield bonds is constrained due to a lack of specialists in this market, but that in the next three months, the British asset management firm may announce the recruitment of a team of one or more portfolio managers and three or four analysts dedicated to this segment.The Credit Alpha strategy, which uses 80% of derivatives, represents total assets of about GBP620m, also counting USD150m in a segregated account on the Lyxor platform. Henderson will apparently decide to soft close the fund when the strategy reached GBP800m, and a hard close at USD900m. However, these limited may be virtually doubled if planned recruitments for the team of US market specialists are realised.
