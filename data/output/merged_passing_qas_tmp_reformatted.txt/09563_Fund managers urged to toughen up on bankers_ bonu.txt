Fund managers urged to toughen up on bankers’ bonuses


Lord Myners, the City minister, has written to fund managers urging them to re-examine the bonus payments they are planning to distribute to bankers, says the Financial Times. He asked the fund managers, such as Schroders and Fidelity, to specify what actions they had taken to “engage with the banks in relation to their bonus decisions”.
