AG2R La Mondiale commits to reduce coal as part of its investments


Deeds to follow words: as it announces its support for the Paris Accord, AG2R La Mondiale is seeking to lay a firm cornerstone for the Beyond 2°C Scenario from the International Energy Agency, which recommends a gradual withdrawal from the coal sector by 2030 in countries belonging to the OECD and the European Union.The social protection group has announced in a new coal exclusionary policy that it commits to cease all new investments in companies whose electricity production is more than 30% achieved with coal, or which have plans to develop coal plants representing an increase of more than 1% to their total production capacity. These measures apply to equities and bonds, for all portfolios invested directly, or which are under the management of the AG2R La Mondiale group and/or the asset management firm AG2R La Mondiale Gestion d’Actifs.Alongside this specific attention to coal, AG2R La Mondiale is also seeking to orient its investments in such a way as to promote energy savings (efficient networks; smart distribution; energy efficiency for equipment, etc.), to promote renewable energies; to support innovative solutions (electricity storage, the Hydrogen industry, production via renewable energies, etc.) “These investments may be made via subscription to green bond issues,” the group says in its exclusionary policy document.At present, the electricity production sector represents 2% of the portfolios of the group, but nearly 20% of its carbon footprint. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) and asset management teams at AG2R La Mondiale commit to systematic dialogue with electricity producers in the portfolio.
