Open-ended real estate funds are a disappearing breed


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } On 26 October, the Munich-based management firm Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investment announced that it is liquidating the open-ended real estate fund P2 Value, following the closures of the KanAm US-grundinvest and DEGI Europa (Aberdeen). With the spectacular end of these three funds, the likelihood that other funds which have suspended their redemptions will reopen has been considerably reduced, Die Welt observes. Currently, with the three products in liquidation, redemptions are frozen for more than EUR25bn in assets (in 11 funds), out of total assets of EUR88bn in the sector. Though KanAm, Aberdeen and Morgan Stanley REI considerably increased the liquidity of their funds through sales of assets, it was not enough to keep up with redemption demands. Professionals give Commerzbank a good part of the blame for the current situation, since as exclusive distributor, it refused to support the reopening of the DEGI Europa fund, and lowered the rating of the real estate fund Premium Management Immobilien-Anlagen from Allianz Global Investors, while offering a discounted transfer from the fund to its own hausinvest product.
