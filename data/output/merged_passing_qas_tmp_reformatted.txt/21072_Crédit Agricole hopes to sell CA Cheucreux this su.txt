Crédit Agricole hopes to sell CA Cheucreux this summer


The future of CA Cheuvreux will soon be a story written outside Crédit Agricole, Agefi reports. The bank has initiated a sales process for its equity broker, which it hopes to complete by mid-July, or failing that, to relaunch the process this autumn. Among the two or three potential buyers are the French firm Kepler Capital Markets. Last year, Cheuvreux lost its parent company EUR70m, according to the CA CIB annual report, on net banking proceeds of EUR164m. The cost of a social plan, and the form it will take, as buyer or acquirer, represents a key element in negotiations, the newspaper adds.
