Amundi reshuffles in London


The resignation earlier this week of Bruno Crastes, CEO and CIO of Amundi London and deputy director of the institutional and third-party distribution profession, followed by the announcement on Wednesday of the departure of Vincent Chaillet and Jean-Noël Alba, two other heads based in London (*), has led the asset management firm, an affiliate of Crédit Agricole and Société Générale, to reshuffle its UK teams. From 19 April, Pascal Blanqué, CIO of Amundi group and director of the institutional and third-party distributors profession, will also become CEO of Amundi London. However, Blanqué will exercise his functions from Paris, while Laurent Crosnier, currently deputy head of fixed income and credit management, who from next week will occupy the position of CIO of Amundi London, will be moving to the British capital. He will work alongside Hervé Leclercq, previously head of risk at Amundi Paris, who becomes deputy CEO and COO of Amundi London. In practice, the departure of Crastes will take place “gradually.” Thus, says Amundi, he will continue to be present in London for a while longer, in order to see the transition through. Some observers have doubts about the operation. “Bruno Crastes’ management style is characterized by the large degree of latitude he leaves to teams, and a management style based largely on ‘intuitu personae,'” one multi-management professional in Paris says. “It is also probable that fund selectors will express dissatisfaction with his departure,” he adds. As to what the near future holds for the outgoing managers, Amundi states that their departures were motivated by a desire to bring a new orientation to their professional careers. On Wednesday, Agefi suggested that they may team up again in the future to create an entrepreneurial project. (*) Vincent Chaillet is head of international bond and absolute performance activities, while Jean-Noël Alba is deputy CEO of CAAM London Branch.
