Credit Suisse AM launches an equity fund dedicated to digital health


Credit Suisse Asset Management (Credit Suisse AM) has announced the opening of the subscription period for its new Credit Suisse (Lux) Global Digital Health Equity fund from 20 November, an equity vehicle focused on the theme of digital health. The fund includes a series of thematic investments by Credit Suisse, based on long-term trends, and makes these available to investors, the banking group says in a statement. “The concept of the digital health fund is based on the observation that the digital transition represents a revolution for the health care sector,” the banking group adds. “It has considerable potential to improve medical services and also to slow the rise of health care costs. With predicted growth of 15% per year, digital health is one of the segments in the health care sector where growth is the most rapid.” The objective for the management team is to find solid SME equities which are able to put innovative products on the market with signifiant commercial potential, and which generate at least 50% of their earnings from the digital health sector. The fund, domiciled in Luxembourg and compliant with the Ucits directive, is managed by Thomas Amrein and Christian Schmid. The subscription period runs until 13 december 2017, for an official launch on 14 December 2017.
