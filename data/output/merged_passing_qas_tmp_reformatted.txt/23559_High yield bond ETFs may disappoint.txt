High yield bond ETFs may disappoint


As investors go for high yield bond funds, Financial Times Fund Management predicts that the returns on these products may be far lower than those of high yield bond indices, due to high transaction costs and market inefficiencies. This observation is particularly true for ETFs. Figures from Lipper reveal that in the past five years, the average high yield ETF was 46 basis points below its index on one month, or 552 points per year, which is far higher than the management fees of 40-50 basis points.
