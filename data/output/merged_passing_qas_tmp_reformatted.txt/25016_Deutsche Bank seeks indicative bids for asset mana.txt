Deutsche Bank seeks indicative bids for asset management activities


Deutsche Bank is inviting potential buyers of its asset management operation to submit initial bids by the end of this week, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing sources familiar with the matter. These “indicative” bids will allow the German bank to gauge who the contenders are for the acquisition, and what price they are prepared to pay, in order to faciliate a final decision in the next few weeks as to whether or not to sell the activity. Indicative bids are often non-binding.
