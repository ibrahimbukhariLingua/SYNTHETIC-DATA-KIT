Allfunds launches an ETF fund transfer solution in Spain


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } The pan-European fund distribution platform Allfunds Bank on Monday, 19 March announced that it is launching a new technological and operational solution which allows Spanish distributors to operate and complete transfers between ETFs and mutual funds interchangeably. Through this solution, “any financial distributor who is a member of the platform can allow its invetors to trade investments in the transferable universe, without any fiscal impact for the end investor,” Allfunds says in a statement. Allfunds is offering a way to transfer from investment funds to ETFs, ETFs to other ETFs, and from ETFs to funds, covering all the various cases currently available under the Spanish tax regime entitled “traspaso.” For this service, Allfunds had to confront a number of challenges, including effective management of decimals in ETFs, identification of instruments in various markets, management of fiscal elements associated with transfers, and total operational consolidation of funds and ETFs via a single and unique efficient channel, the firm says.
