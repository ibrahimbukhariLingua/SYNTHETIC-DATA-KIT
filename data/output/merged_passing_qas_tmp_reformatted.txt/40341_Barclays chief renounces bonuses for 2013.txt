Barclays chief renounces bonuses for 2013


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The CEO of the British bank Barclays, Antony Jenkins, on 3 February announced that he would be renouncing all bonuses for the year 2013. Jenkins stated that he has taken the decision due to the various fines and provisions written down by the group, and due to the effort required of shareholders as part of a capital increase of nearly GBP6bn last year. “I have concluded that it would not be fair, under the circumstances, for me to accept a bonus for 2013, and I have therefore respectively declined the one which was offered me by the board of directors,” Jenkins, who was appointed in summer 2012 to restore the reputation of the bank embroiled in the Libor scandal, says in a statement.
