Investors call on SEC to enforce ESG management criteria


More than 50 professionals and businesses specialised in investment have called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to require publicly-traded firms to provide information to their shareholders on an annual basis on a variety of environmental, social and governance (ESG) questions. The signatories of the initiative, all of whom belong to the social investment forum (SIF), a United States association which aimed to promote the practice and development of socially responsible investment, would like to see businesses publish coherent indicators of their sustainable development activities, following the most recent recommendations of the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative). The signatories claim that the SEC should produce recommendations which would clearly reveal the necessity for businesses to inform the public about short- and long-term risks in the area of sustainable development. The 24-page document, addressed to the US market regulator, argues that there are a growing number of reasons that disclosure of ESG information should be obligatory. Investors are increasingly demanding this information, as revealed by the number of investors backing such resolutions at general shareholdersâ€™ meetings - an average of 25% in the past five years, compared with less than 10% in the 1990s, according to statistics from RiskMetrics. Outside the United States, governments and regulators - in Sweden, the United Kingdom, and France - are requiring businesses to provide information on various aspects of their sustainable development practices; and last but not least, several studies reveal the close ties between respect for ESG criteria and financial performance.
