Clients upset with suspension of a UBS real estate fund


Agefi Switzerland reports that a group of French-speaking Swiss former clients of the wealth management firm UBS are going to sue for reimbursement of their investments in the UBS real estate fund Global Property Fund, which was liquidated in late 2009. Their investments in the fund are still locked up. The plaintiffs claim that the value of their investments is continuing to decrease: the fund has lost more than 21% so far this year, after a similarly negative performance in 2009. Another complaint is that they will need to wait 3 to 5 years to recuperate their money, meaning that they will get it back only in 2012 at best. This is the time needed for the properties owned by the investment vehicle to be sold off. This could create difficulties, for example, in cases of inheritance, or if the clients in question would like to leave UBS.
