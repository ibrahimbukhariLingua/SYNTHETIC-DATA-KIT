Jean-Pierre Jouyet calls for strong European regulatory authority


In an interview with Les Echos, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, the president of the French financial market regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), questions the pertinence of measures by the German government to combat speculation, and calls on the institutions of the European Union to increase the powers of the future European financial market authority. “This situation creates disorder and raises questions about the credibility of European regulation. We absolutely need to have a concerted European position on this issue. We have had conferences by telephone between the market regulators as part of the CESR … we need to go further. We need not only to have real European coordination, but also a European market supervisory authority with adequate power to speak with a single voice in urgent situations,” Jouyet says.
