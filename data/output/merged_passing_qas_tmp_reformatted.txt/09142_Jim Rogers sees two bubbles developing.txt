Jim Rogers sees two bubbles developing


In an interview with Handelsblatt, Jim Rogers has said that he sees two bubbles in the making: one in US government bonds, and one in real estate in some Chinese cities, such as Shanghai and Hong Kong. The bowtie-wearing investment guru says that he currently holds two currencies, the US dollar and the Yen, but that his exposure to the dollar is purely tactical. Meanwhile, Rogers advises investing in soft commodities, which are at an incredibly low level historically, 60-70% below their all-time highs.
