Tech at asset management firms is no longer cutting-edge


Back office is no longer a top ambition for asset management firms, according to a survey on the impact of portfolio accounting systems on growth strategy at asset management firms, published by SimCorp. The financial sector software provider interviewed 75 heads at over 50 firms in the sector in the United States and Canada.The survey finds that nearly half of respondents estimate that their current accounting systems are “not able to support the launch of new products in a timely fashion,” SimCorp says. Nearly 40% say that their portfolio accounting systems are not able to unite all asset classes in a single system, which leads to errors in agglomerating the data, evaluating the portfolio and calculating performance levels and exposure to risk. Among the other shortfalls in the back office are a lack of presentation of data in the form of charts, limits in configuration of new securities, handling of derivatives, management of asset classes, confirmation of transactions, reporting and intra-day operation monitoring.
