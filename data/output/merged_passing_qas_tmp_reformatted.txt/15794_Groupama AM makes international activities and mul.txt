Groupama AM makes international activities and multi-management its priority development areas


Jean-Marie Catala, head of development, explained on 8 March that the internationalisation of the product range is at the core of the strategy of Groupama Asset Management. The strategy has already resulted in the creation of an international sales team, led by Arnaud Ganet (see Newsmanagers of 12 October 2010). The French manager will then add to its teams dedicated to international development, with the creation of a team to handle central and northern Europe (Benelux, German-speaking Switzerland, and the Scandinavian countries).The strategy also resulted in the recent creation (14 December 2010) of the Luxembourg Sicav G Fund, which already has three sub-funds, with a total of EUR200m in assets. As Francis Ailhaud, CEO of Groupama AM, explains, the vehicle will be highly useful for international sales, and not only in Europe.Groupama AM is also planning to add to its multi-management offerings, at Groupama Fund Pickers, directional multi-management, at Groupama Alternative Asset Management, alternative multi-management, and the absolute return and high-conviction management units. These will all be included in the Σ (sigma) platform, should the merger of the entities, slated for 15 April, be approved by the AMF. Σ will also be equipped to handle mixed mandates combining direct management and multi-management.Personnel in the new management unit is nearly complete. It will include 15 fully-operating managers. The new CIO, Antoine de Salins (see Newsmanagers of 13 January 2011) has announced that initial assets at Σ will total EUR2bn, with 15 products.
