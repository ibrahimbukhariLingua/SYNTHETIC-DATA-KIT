CAVP adopts a socially responsible investment charter


The Caisse dâ€™assurance vieillesse des pharmaciens (CAVP) has announced that it has adopted a charter which defines the framework and general principles for responsible investment by the Caisse, and its climate, environmental, social and governance engagement process, operationalised for 2017 and 2018. The Caisse has also announced that its portfolios will undergo annual analysis, both from an ESG and a climate risk standpoint. For the first year, the perimeter of the study is limited to equities held directly. The field of application will be gradually extended to review the entire portfolio by 2021, and concrete proposals for improvement will be implemented by managers. The investment policy of CAVP is part of conviction-based management. Stock-picking will be carried out, excepting regulatory exclusions (financing for terrorism, combatting money-laundering, manufacturing and sale of weapons prohibited by international conventions, etc.). The Charter will be appended to the management agreements for dedicated funds, and managers will take the principles of the Charter into account in their investment policies, in collaboration with the CAVP. An annual report on Climate-ESG actions written by managers of dedicated funds will be sent to CAVP.
