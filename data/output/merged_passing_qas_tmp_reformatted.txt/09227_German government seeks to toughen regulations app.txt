German government seeks to toughen regulations applicable to several financial instruments


Wolfgang Schäuble, the German federal finance minister, announced on Wednesday that his services will prepare proposed legislation for April which would strengthen protection for investors and increase liquidity on capital markets. The bill would aim for passage during the summer before the Cabinet. The major points to be included in the legislation would be tougher measures to protect investors in the grey market, and tougher sanctions on financial services providers who give fallacious advice. The bill will also forbid naked shorts and introduce transparency requirements for declared short positions. The German government is also proposing to implement added disclosure for financial instruments, in order to prevent surprise take-overs of businesses. The minister is planning to introduce a minimum time period for retention of shares in open-ended real estate funds and minimal liquidity requirements which will be a function of the delay period for redemptions. In addition, the German government would create an “orderly” liquidation procedure for real estate funds which have been closed for a long period of time.
