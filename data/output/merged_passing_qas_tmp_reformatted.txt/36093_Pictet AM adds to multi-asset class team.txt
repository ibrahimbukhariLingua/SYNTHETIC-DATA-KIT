p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Pictet Asset Management (Pictet AM) has caught a haul. The asset management firm has recruited three specialists in multi-asset class management from Baring Asset Management, including Percival Stanion, Andrew Cole and Shaniel Ramjee. The three recruits, who resigned from Barings in August, will join Pictet in the coming months. Stanion, who spent 13 years at Barings most recently as head of multi-asset class unit, will be appointed as vice chairman of Pictet Asset Management and will also become head of multi-asset class strategies for the firm (outside Switzerland). In this role, he will report to Olivier Ginguen√©, head of asset allocation and quantitative investment. In the wake of this triple recruitment, Pictet AM has announced plans to launch a new multi-asset class fund, the Diversified Growth Fund, with an ambition to launch other similar products in the future.
