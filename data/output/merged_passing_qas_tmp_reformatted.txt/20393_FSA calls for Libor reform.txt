FSA calls for Libor reform


The Libor inter-bank lending rate, which is embroiled in a manipulation scandal, is no longer serving its function and must be modified, the director of the Financial Services Authority (FSA), Martin Wheatley, announced at a presentation of the agency’s recommendations, released on 10 August. “The existing Libor governance structure is no longer adapted, and reforms are necessary,” Wheatley, who was tasked by the British government with formulating recommendations to revise the system for setting Libor (the London Interbank Offered Rate), announced. The government may include the recommendations in a law on financial services currently being debated in the House of Lords. Wheatley, who is also responsible for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), proposes that more objective data be included in the method of calculating Libor, on the basis of actual transactions and not merely judgement, in order to reduce the ways in which the rate can be manipulated. Wheatley also states that other reference rates should be used as a basis for at least part of the Libor transactions. “In some cases, there are other rates which can be used more broadly,” he says. “In other cases, new reference rates could be identified and developed,” he claims. Lastly, Wheatley claims it is necessary to strengthen the powers of the legal authorities and market regulators to pursue violators. Actors in the sector have until 7 September to respond to the recommendations, which will then be finalised by the end of September.
