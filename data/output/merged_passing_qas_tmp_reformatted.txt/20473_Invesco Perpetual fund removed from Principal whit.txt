Invesco Perpetual fund removed from Principal white list


The Invesco Perpetual Income fund, managed by Neil Woodford, whose assets under management total GBP9bn, has been withdrawn from the preferential list at Principal Investment Management for the first time since 2002, Money Marketing reports. The list includes the top 14 sectoral funds on the basis of total returns and risk over a five-year period. The top three on the list are now the Troy Trojan Income fund (GBP684m in assets), Threadneedle Equity Income fund (GBP1.3bn), and the RBS Income fund (GBP60m). Paul Surguy, investment manager at Principal AM, says Woodfordâ€™s fund has posted returns below the average for funds on the list between June 2010 and June 2011, but that it continues to have a buy recommendation. Principal has also removed the CF Liontrust Macro Equity Income Fund (previously known as the CF Walker Crips Equity Income), whose assets under management total GBP253m. The two funds have been replaced by the JO Hambro UK Equity Income Fund (GBP1.1bn in assets) and the Franklin UK Equity Income Fund (GBP142m).
