North American companies still have a long way to catch up on climate change


According to the EIRIS 2009 Climate Change Tracker, US and Canadian companies are catching up on climate change, but they must do much more if they are to manage their carbon risks and play an active part in the transition to a low-carbon economy. The vast majority of North American companies operating in sectors with a high carbon footprint now have a corporate-wide policy on climate change (91% compared to 93% at the global level).However, when it comes to implementing, concrete measures to deliver on corporate climate change policies and commitments, businesses in North American still fall behind companies in other countries, with rising CO2 emissions, poor disclosure and a lack of implementation. For instance, only 16% of North American companies have made a commitment to link board remuneration to GHG emissions reductions compared to 28% at the global level. And product impacts ignored: only 9% have set targets to reduce indirect climate change impacts arising from their products, compared to 19% at the global level.
