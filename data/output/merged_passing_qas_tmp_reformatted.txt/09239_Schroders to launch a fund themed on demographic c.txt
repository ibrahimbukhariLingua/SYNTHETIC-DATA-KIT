Schroders to launch a fund themed on demographic change


As a complement to its climate change fund (SISF Global Cimate Change Equity) and a fund focused on increasing demand for energy in emerging countries (SISF Global Energy), Schroders is planning to launch the Global Wealth Dynamics fund, which will focus on demographic change, in the next few months, Funds People reports. Gavin Marriot, international equities manager, will concentrate on businesses which respond to the needs of developing countries, such as the Mexican firm Homex, or which are in a position to profit from the new demographic configurations taking shape there. In the area of health, the manager prefers technologies which aim to identify and prevent illness, which will boost the growth of emerging countries, to investments in businesses in developed countries.
