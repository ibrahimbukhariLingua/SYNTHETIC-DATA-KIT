Aviva Investors to launch a UCITS-compliant fund of inflation-linked emerging market bonds


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Aviva Investors currently manages about EUR2.5bn in three emerging market debt products. These include a UCITS-compliant fund of external bonds (in hard currencies), with USD660m in assets, a fund of emerging market bonds in local currencies, with USD680m, and an emerging markets inflation-linked LC bond fund which does not comply with UCITS, with USD780m (on a USD400bn market), launched in January 2010.The British asset manager is now working with its legal team to convert the last of these products into a UCITS-compliant fund by second quarter, as European regulations on the distribution of risk have been made more flexible. The fact of holding 55% Brazilian paper is no longer an obstacle, as it was at the time of launch. At the same time, Aviva wants to avoid to close the fund, in order to later open it within UCITS III standards, as in the second case the firm would have to pay the Brazilian 6% IOF tax on foreign investment again.
