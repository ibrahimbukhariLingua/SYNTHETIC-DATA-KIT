Stoxx launches three European “Islamic” equities indices


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } On 23 February, Stoxx Limited announced the launch of three new indices of Sharia-compliant ESG (environmental, social and governance) equities, the Stoxx Europe Islamic Index and two sub-indices of large caps, Stoxx Europe Islamic 50 and Euro Stoxx Islamic 50. The three new indices measure the performance of Sharia-compliant companies belonging to the Stoxx Europe 600. The indices are designed to serve as benchmarks for actively-managed funds as well as ETFs and other “investible” products. To be included in the index, shares of the Stoxx Europe 600 must pass through two successive filters. In the first stage, firms are excluded if they are active in the areas of production of non-halal foods, tobacco, alcohol, gambling, advertising, the financial sector, insurance, production of entertainment or music, trading of gold or silver, or production of arms and weapons. In a second stage, Stoxx analyses the shares to exclude firms where income from interest and revenue from non-Sharia activities exceed 5% of earnings. In addition, the ratio of non-Sharia-compliant debt to the total balance sheet or total market capitalisation of the firm (taking the higher of the two) may not exceed 33%. Finally, the proportion of assets which generate interest must not exceed 33%, either of the total balance sheet or the total market capitalisation.
