Outflows from equity funds at the end of May


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Some investors opted to pull the sell-in-May-and-go-away trigger heading into June, according to EPFR Global. Emerging equity and bond funds found themselves first in the line of fire. EPFR global-tracked equity funds recorded collective outflows of USD2.79 billion during the week ending May 29 as retail redemptions hit a year-to-date high. Investors remain sceptical of France, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands, which have received additional time to reduce their deficits, and which appear sluggish to implement structural reforms. French equity funds saw outflows of EUR263m in the final days of May. However, investors are returning to Greek equity funds. Bond funds attracted USD1.37 million, their second lowest total of 2013. Money market funds took in a net USD8.52 billion, with commitments to US funds offsetting redemptions from Europe and Japan funds, thereby posting back-to-back weekly inflow for the first time since early January.
