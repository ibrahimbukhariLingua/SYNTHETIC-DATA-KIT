Fidelity overhauls its distribution to institutionals


The US asset management firm Fidelity Investments has announced the creation of a new organization dedicated to distribution and customer service, entitled Fidelity Institutional Asset Management (FIAM), to better meet the expectations and needs of consultants and institutional investors. Fidelity Institutional Asset Management unites the distribution and customer services teams from Pyramis Global Advisors and Fidelity Financial Advisor Solutions as part of a single team, as well as the team responsible for relationship with consultants in the professional services group division of Fidelity, to “create a single and integrated organisation,” according to a statement. The new entity “will be the largest organisation serving institutional investors, with more than USD540bn in assets under administration,” the asset management firm claims.As part of the reshuffle, Jeffrey Lagarce, who has been working at Fidelity for 15 years, and had previously served as president of Pyramis Global Advisor, has been appointed as president of Fidelity Institutional Asset Management. He will report to Gerard McGraw, president of Fidelity Institutional. Meanwhile, Scott Couto, previously president of Fidelity Financial Advisor Solutions, has been appointed as head of distribution, in which position he reports to Lagarce.The reshuffle has the consequence of setting the Pyramis brand at half mast. By integrating the distribtion teams from Pyramis into Fidelity Institutional Asset Management, Fidelity has announced effectively that the equity team at Pyramis, which will now be known as FIAM Equity, will be integrated into the asset management organisation at Fidelity. As a part of this move, Pam Holding, previously chief investment officer at Pyramis Global Advisors, will now assume the position of chief investment officer at FIAM, and will report to Derek Young, vice chairman of Fidelity Institutional Asset Management and president of the global asset allocation division of the asset management department at Fidelity. «There are no changes in the equity investment team at FIAM, or to its products, processes, or risk supervision,” Fidelity states.
