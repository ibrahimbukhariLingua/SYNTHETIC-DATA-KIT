Equity investors fleeing Europe and Japan


Europe is still not attracting investors. In the week to 6 March, funds dedicated to European equities saw substantial further net outflows of $3.1bn, following $4.1bn the previous week, according to the weekly Bank of America Merrill Lynch study based on data from the global flow evolution monitoring specialist EPFR Global. For several weeks, investors have also been avoiding Japan: in the week to 8 March [sic], funds specialised in Japanese equities show net outflows of $1.8bn. According to analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, growth and interest rates in the eurozone are trapped in a deflationary cycle of “Japanification.” However, a decision by the European Central Bank (ECB) to postpone a prime interest rate hike until next year at the earliest, and to announce the launch of new long-term refinancing operations announced in September to counter slowing growth in the euro zone, may yet turn the situation around. The euro, which is at 20-month lows, could give a boost to inexpensive European cyclical stocks. US equity funds again finished the week in negative territory, albeit with more moderate outflows, still totalling $5.5bn. Emerging market equity funds still attracted $0.5bn, but the rising dollar makes this asset class less attractive. Over the past three weeks, emerging market equity funds show a negative balance of USD0.1bn. In all geographical regions combined, equity flows are at their worst levels since 2008, with net outflows of about $60bn, of which about $10bn have flowed out in the past week. Inflows to bond funds have remained in line with previous weeks, at $8.8bn. Funds specialised in investment grade (IG) bonds attracted $9.5bn. In line with previous weeks, emerging markets have posted positive net inflows of $1.6bn. Funds specialised in precious metals have seen net outflows of $1.2bn, the largest of the past 28 weeks.
