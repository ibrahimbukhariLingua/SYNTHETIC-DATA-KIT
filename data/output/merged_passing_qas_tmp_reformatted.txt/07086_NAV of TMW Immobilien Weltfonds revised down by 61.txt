NAV of TMW Immobilien Weltfonds revised down by 61 cents


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Munich-based TMW Pramerica Property Investment GmbH on 28 September announced that the net asset value of shares in its open-ended real estate fund TMW Immobilien Fonds (whose redemption freeze has just been extended on 15 September) has been revised downward by 61 cents, to EUR50.48, a depreciation of 1.19%. The move was rendered necessary by a new expert opinion on the value of the Concord Terrace building, located in Sunrise, Florida. The property, previously valued at USD10.6m, is now listed on the books with a value of EUR0, as it has failed to attract tenants. The property was leased in 2006 to Nortel Networks, until March 2017. But since then, Nortel has gone bankrupt, and vacated the premises on 31 October 2009, at the hight of the real estate crisis in south Florida.
