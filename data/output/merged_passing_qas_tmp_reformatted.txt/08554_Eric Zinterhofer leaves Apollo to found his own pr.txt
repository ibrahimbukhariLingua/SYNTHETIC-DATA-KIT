Eric Zinterhofer leaves Apollo to found his own private equity firm


The husband of heiress Aerin Lauder, Eric Zinterhofer, chairman of Charter Communications, is leaving Apollo Global Management, where he is co-head of media & telecom investing, to found his own private equity firm, according to souces familiar with the matter cited by the Wall Street Journal. His new fund, which will be supported by the Lauder family, may raise USD500m to USD1bn, and will specialise in media and telecommunications. Apollo, for its part, is planning to appoint Gregory Beard, managing director of Riverstone Holdings, as head of commodities. He replaces Neal Shear, who, after a brief stint at Apollo, has moved on to become global head of securities at UBS.
