Foreign asset managers sill making only timid inroads into German institutional investment market


Foreign asset management firms are gaining market share in the German institutional investment market, according to a study commissioned by Axa Investment Managers from Telos and Kommalpha, entiled “Spezialfondsmarkt 2011,” which surveyed 170 investors. Although respondents continue to prefer German management firms overall, 18% of respondents can imagine working with foreign asset management firms in the future, compared with 14% last year, while the percentage of institutional investors who would rather give their preference to German asset management firms has fallen to 36% from 44%.According to Axa IM, foreign players are better accepted by German investors because, facing low German rates and therefore increased pressure to earn strong returns, investors have increasingly turned to higher-risk and international assets, such as emerging market bonds, which require sizeable research, analysis, and portfolio management resources, and detailed knowledge of the local markets. These characteristics are often an advantage of major foreign management firms.Axa IM notes on the other hand, however, that foreign promoters seeking to gain a foothold in the German market have had some difficulty in carving out a presence for themselves as local rivals already have a strong presence and use a well-thought-out growth strategy. As Frank Richter, head of institutional sales for Germany and Austria at Axa IM points out, it is indispensable for foreign asset management firms seeking to gain a presence in the German institutional market to have a profound knowledge of the particularities of the German market, the specific requirements of various groups of institutional investors, and the local regulatory environment, and to have teams of confirmed professionals who speak German.
