Tobam launches Anti-Benchmark Canadian Equity fund


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } The asset management firm TOBAM on 16 April announced the launch of the Anti-Benchmark Canadian Equity (UCITS IV) fund. The fund has received seed capital from a major institutional investor. The Anti-Benchmark Canadian Equity fund aims to maximise diversification of an investment universe represented by the S&P/TSX Composite Equity index, by applying the patented Anti-Benchmark process to eliminate geographical, sectoral and style biases which may appear in more traditional allocation methods such as weighting by cap size. The fund aims to outperform the cap-weighted S&P/TSX index by about 4-6% per year over a full market cycle, while significantly reducing volatility (about 30%). The fund reflects the Anti-Benchmark Canadian Equity strategy managed by TOBAM since April 2011 for a US institutional client. Since its creation at the end of March 2013, the Anti-Benchmark Canadian Equity strategy has posted returns of +13%, outperforming the index (-5.6%) by nearly 10% on annual terms. In the same period, the strategy has reduced volatility by 33%.
