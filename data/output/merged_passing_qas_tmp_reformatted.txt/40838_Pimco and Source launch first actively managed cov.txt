Pimco and Source launch first actively managed covered bond ETF


The asset management group Pimco and the ETF provider Source have announced the launch of the Pimco Covered Bond Source UCITS ETF (Ticker: COVR). The product allow investors to participate in the performance of globally issued covered bonds. It will combine the actively managed approach PIMCO takes to covered bonds alongside the various benefits of an ETF. The PIMCO Covered Bond Source UCITS ETF, managed by Kristion Mierau, senior vice president and head of PIMCO’s European covered bond portfolio management team, is the first actively managed covered bond exchange traded fund on the global market.Kristion Mierau said in a statement: “This expanding investment universe creates new opportunities for investors and fulfils their increasing demand for ‘safe assets’. “In the current low interest rate environment, covered bonds offer attractive risk-adjusted yields and are potentially a compelling alternative to broad European government bonds, as the asset class has historically provided higher returns with lower volatility and lower sensitivity to changes in market yield levels.” Launched on Deutsche Bourse’s ETF segment Xetra, the Pimco Covered Bond Source UCITS ETF tracks the Barclays Euro Aggregate Covered 3% Cap index, and its annual management fee is 0.38%. Distributions are paid on a monthly basis. Pimco has also entered into a cooperation with Clearstream, giving investors the possibility to order shares of an ETF through Clearstream’s Vestima platform as a mutual fund with daily fixing. This is a ‘first’ for Vestima and Pimco.
