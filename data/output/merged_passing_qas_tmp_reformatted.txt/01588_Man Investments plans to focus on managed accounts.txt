Man Investments plans to focus on managed accounts


In an interview with Cinco Días, Jaime Castán, head of hedge fund selection at Man Investments, says the return of investors to hedge funds is largely a matter of institutional investors at present. Castán claims that the lesson of the crisis that that potentially illiquid strategies such as relative value, event-driven or special situations, will become second priorities, while managed futures, global macro, and long/short equities will become more important. Man Investments is betting on more liquid strategies and on increased transparency, particularly via managed accounts, which are very much in demand from clients.
