Vontobel AM launches a fund for banks


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Vontobel Asset Management is launching a fund for banks to satisfy their liquidity reserve requirements, the LCR Global Bond Fund. “Since Basel III, banks and savings banks have been confronted with a new ratio to evaluate short-term liquidity risks,” a statement says. “Measuring the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) has led to additional costs, as it requires that a certain liquidity level be maintained; this liquidity is materialised through the purchase of additional securities, to which most of the time negative interest rates then apply. The LCR Global Bond strategy … offers banks and savings banks a means to make money despite a difficult environment for investment. In substanct, the LCR approach is to invest, while hedging against currency risks, in top quality bonds from regions and countries which present more attractive interest rate structures.” The strategy is managed by Anna Holzgang, head of the Global & Swiss Bonds team at Vontobel Asset Management. Vontobel Asset Management is an affiliate of the Swiss Vontobel group. It has over 300 employees and has CHF86bn in assets under management as of 30 June 2016.
