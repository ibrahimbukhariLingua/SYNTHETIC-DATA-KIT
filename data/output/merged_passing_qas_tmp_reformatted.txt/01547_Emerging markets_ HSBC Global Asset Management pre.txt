Emerging markets: HSBC Global Asset Management prefers Latin American equities


According to Simona Paravani, a strategist at HSBC Global Asset Management and manager of the World Selection fund, investors have every reason to bet on Latin America, a region which may be expected to perform better than Asia in the whort term. The specialist points out that, on the basis of PER in the past 12 months, Latin American equities (with a PER of 15.6 times) are trading more than 40% below emerging Asian equities (at 26.3 times), compared with an average difference of only 5% over the past five years. “Latin American equities therefore appear to be somewhat undervalued compared with emerging Asia, and may potentially outperform them, particularly if economic data continues to bring surprise increases, thanks to improving domestic demand in Brazil,” Paravani says.
