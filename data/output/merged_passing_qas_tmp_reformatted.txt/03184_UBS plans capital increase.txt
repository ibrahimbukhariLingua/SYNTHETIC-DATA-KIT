UBS plans capital increase


On the basis of preliminary results for April and May as well as estimated results for June, UBS predicts that it will post a net loss for second quarter 2009. Projected losses are largely due to capital losses on liabilities and restructuring charges already announced. However, the Swiss group announced on Thursday, operating results for April-June are expected to improvecompared with the first quarter 2009, largely due to more favourable market conditions for the investment bank and a reduction in losses and write-downs on high-risk positions inherited from the past. In second quarter, the three wealth management and asset management divisions show net outflows thus far. The bank has also announced that it will be offering 293,258,050 shares to a restricted number of institutional investors at a price of CHF13 per share. This will raise a net total of nearly CHF3.8bn.
