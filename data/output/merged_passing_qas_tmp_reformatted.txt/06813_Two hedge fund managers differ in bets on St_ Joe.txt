Two hedge fund managers differ in bets on St. Joe


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } David Einhorn, head of the hedge fund management firm Greenlight Capital, revealed last week that he is shorting shares in the developer St. Joe Co., on the premise that the land the firm owns is worth only a fraction of what the firm values it at, the Wall Street Journal reports. Einhorn became famous due to his bets against Lehman. But Einhorn has found that St. Joe is one of the major bets of another hedge fund manager, Fairholme Capital Management, led by another emblematic personality, Bruce Berkowitz. Berkowitz, whose firm owns 29% of St. Joe, trusts the figures advanced by the firm.
