Deutsche Bank develops Sharia-compliant services in Malaysia


Six weeks after obtaining an international Islamic banking licence in Malaysia (see Newsmanagers of 2 March), Deutsche Bank has launched Sharia-compliant investment and custodial services. Islamic Securities Services will be open to Islamic funds and management firms from Malaysia and other countries, while Deutsche Trustees Malaysia last month extended its product range with the creation of a registrar and a transfer agency.
