World - Carlyle chief warns private equity firms


David Rubinstein, co-founder of Carlyle, has claimed at the Super Return convention in Berlin that many private equity investors could improve their image this year by avoiding responding to the economic difficulties being encountered by many of the companies in their portfolios with large-scale layoffs, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. Private equity companies will also have to apply the same recipe to themselves that they impose on companies they control, by cutting staff and spectacularly reducing pay scales.
