Ascendancy of Deutsche Bank «rationalisers» at DWS


With the appointment of Ingo Gefeke and Axel Schwarzer, Kevin Parker, head of asset management at Deutsche Bank, has succeeded in asserting his authority over DWS heads anxious to retain their independence. The new appointees are part of a group of “rationalisers” at the bank, Handelsblatt writes, and the new strong-man, Ingo Gefeke, comes with a reputation as a controller. Apparently, the time for savings has come at DWS, which Handelsblatt reports has been losing money.
