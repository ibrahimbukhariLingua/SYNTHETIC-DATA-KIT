p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } London-based MackayWilliams LLP and Berlinâ€™s Metrinomics GmbH, which previously published Fund Market Focus, have created a fund market analysis joint venture, Fund Buyer Focus Ltd. The goal of the collaboration is to combine research into European external fund buyers which has been undertaken since 2001 by Metrinomics with the analysis and perspective capacities of MackayWilliams.The project will allow Metrinomics to concentrate its primary activites on research, particularly in telecommunications. MackayWilliams, for its part, will develop the coverage and depth of its monthly publication Fund Radar, independently of Fund Buyer Focus.Fund Buyer Focus will continue the Fund Market Focus surveys of samples of over 900 respondents from a universe of over 4,000 professional fund actors in Europe. Combining these results with analysis of various markets, the new firm will be able to provide interesting advice about the dynamics of fund markets in terms of both supply and demand, nationally as well as internationally. Clients will then have access to a unique source of indicators to measure the success of distribution and sales strategies.The team at Fund Buyer Focus includes five specialists. It will be led jointly by Hans Schmolke, CEO of Metrinomics, and Rodney Williams, CEO of MackayWilliams, who will personally be involved in the development of products, sales and marketing.MackayWilliams was founded in 2010 by Diana McKay and Rodney Williams, who founded Feri Fund Markets Information (Feri FMI) with Feri Trust, a firm which was sold to Thomson Reuters in 2007.
