Exposure to European money market funds a subject of growing concern


US money market funds may hold only a very small slice of Greek public debt, but they have about USD1trn in shares issued by major European banks such as BNP Paribas, Barclays and Deutsche Bank, for example, in their portfolios. And these banks themselves are sitting on mountains of government bonds issued by Greece and other European countries, which exposes them to significant losses if the European sovereign debt crisis turns bad, the Wall Street Journal observes.The issue is also of concern to the SEC and the Fed. The financial services committee of the US house of representatives will also hold a hearing on the subject with financial sector chiefs on Friday, on the subject of the financial stability of mutual funds.
