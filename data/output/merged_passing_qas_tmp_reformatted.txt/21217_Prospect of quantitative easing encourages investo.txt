In the week to 20 June, investors were not short of bad news, including slowed growth in Germany and China, the Spanish banking crisis, warnings about corporate results, and signs of weakness in the US economy. But investors concluded that in suh an environment, a further wave of quantitative easing is more likely.Equity funds overall for the first time since mid-March posted net subscriptions for the week, according to EPFR Global. European equity funds underwent redemptions for their fifth consecutive week, but they were partly offset by subscriptions from institutional investors to German equity funds, totalling USD869m.Bond funds posted subscriptions in the week ending on 20 June totalling USD4.14bn, of which three quarters were absorbed by US bond funds.Money market funds underwent outflows of USD33.43bn, their highest level since the first week of August 2011. Several factors contributed to this development including the end of the tax quarter in the United States and prospects of further quantitative easing which will wipe out already limited returns.
