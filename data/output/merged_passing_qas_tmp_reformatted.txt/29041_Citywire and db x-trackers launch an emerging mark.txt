Citywire and db x-trackers launch an emerging market indicator


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } The Citywire db x-trackers Emerging Markets Sentiment Indicator (SEMI) was unveiled on 27 June. It aims to be the first predictive indicator in Europe of capital flows to emerging markets. It is calculated independently by Citywire, and is sponsored by Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management (DeAWM). The sentiment indicator reflects the opinion of fund management professionals about emerging markets, and is based on the results of a Citywire quarterly survey of 101 managers focused on emerging markets, with total assets of about EUR200bn. The most recent survey was carried out in March and April 2013.In detail, the EMSI is established on the basis of manager sentiment concerning ten markets: Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, South Africa and Taiwan. For equities, bonds and diversified portfolios, Citywire asks managers about their current sentiment concerning markets as well as the evolution they expect for markets in the next twelve months, on one hand, and on the weighting of portfolios on a six-month horizon, on the other.The EMSI (base 1000) came out at 1009, which reflects a predominantly optimistic attitude. Among the markets under review, managers are preferring China and India for the next six months: 34% of managers are planning to increase allocation to China in their funds by at least 5% in the next 6 months, and the percentage stands at 32% for India.As a complement, Citywire is asking respondents how the MSCI Emerging Market Index will develop compared with the MSCI World Index. For the first edition of the EMSI, 49% of managers predict that the MSCI EM will outperform the MSCI World, while 31% hold the opposite opinion.Institutional investors may access the report for free upon request at the address http://www.etf.db.com/DE/DE/sentiment-indicator
