Strong increase in AUM at Axa in first quarter


Earnings for the asset management division at Axa were up 10% in first quarter to EUR809m, largely due to high average assets under management per client. Net outflows totalled EUR12bn, (compared with about EUR21bn in fourth quarter 2009), largely due to a significant decrease in outflows from AllianceBernstein in the institutional client segment. Outflows from AXA Investment Managers were largely in the institutional client segment (particularly at AXA Rosenberg). Assets under management totalled EUR877bn, well above the levels announced on 31 December 2009 (EUR845bn), due to rising markets (EUR19bn) and favourable currency effects (EUR25bn, largely due to a rising US dollar against the Euro). Earnings for life insurance, savings, and retirement activities were up 0.6% to EUR16.54bn. Net inflows were positive to the tune of EUR4bn, higher than the EUR3.3bn inflows in first quarter 2009. This increase of EUR0.7bn is largely due to an increase in inflows (of EUR0.3bn) and to a higher rate of retention of clients (EUR0.4bn).
