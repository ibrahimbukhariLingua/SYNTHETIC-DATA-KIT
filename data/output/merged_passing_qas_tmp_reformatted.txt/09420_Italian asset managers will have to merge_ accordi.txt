Italian asset managers will have to merge, according to Assogestioni


In an interview with Il Sole â€“ 24 Ore, Marcello Messori, chairman of the Italian association of asset managers (Assogestioni), claims that the Italian asset management industry will need a wave of consolidation, which will create a few major players able to compete with other European players, and several smaller, specialised firms. This evolution will reduce the dependence of asset management firms on banks. The Italian asset management industry is in crisis, particularly Italian-registered funds, the article notes.
