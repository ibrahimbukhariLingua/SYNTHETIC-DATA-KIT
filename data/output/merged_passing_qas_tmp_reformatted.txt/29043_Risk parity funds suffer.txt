Risk parity managers use leverage to increase returns on bond investments, in order to make them more closely resemble equity investments.In addition, equities have fallen at the same time as bonds after the Fed suggested that it may slow its quantitative easing policy. To make the situation worse, commodities and inflation-linked securities, which are largely used by risk parity managers, have also seen heavy losses due to the decline of inflationary expectations.According to Morningstar, risk parity mutual funds have seen average losses of 6.75%, while a composite index of 60% S&P 500 and 40% Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index made 6.76%. Risk parity funds often aim to beat a 60/40 benchmark.
