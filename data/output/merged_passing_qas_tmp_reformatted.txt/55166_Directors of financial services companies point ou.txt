Directors of financial services companies point out lack of efficiency in regulations


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Senior directors at financial services companies are afraid that regulations will challenge the stability of their sector, according to the most recent Global Regulatory Outlook annual survey by Duff & Phelps, covering global regulatory outlooks in 2016 and beyond. To the question of whether regulatory changes in the past few years have made it possible to put adequate protection in place against future crashes, only 6% of respondents say yes. However, 37% estimate that this is not the case, and 54% say that new rules only offer potential protection against future crises. When they are asked whether regulations have improved the confidence of investors and conumers in the sector, fewer than one third (31%) say yes. For 575 of respondents, the impact was none or minimal, while 8% feel that confidence in the sector has been damaged by regulatory changes. These results show a degradation since last year. The directors surveyed are particularly concerned about what they perceive as a lack of coordination between various regulators worldwide, with only 16% esitmating that the sector is oriented toward a single body of regulations.
