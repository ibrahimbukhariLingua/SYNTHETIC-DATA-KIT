Old Mutual recruits in Latin America


The South African Old Mutual group on 19 November announced that it is scaling up its distribution capacities on emerging markets, with the acquisition of a majority stake in AIVA Business Platforms (AIVA). The initiative will allow Old Mutual to strengthen its presence on certain emerging markets, particularly in Latin America. The transaction is still pending regulatory approval, but is expected to be completed in early 2013. AIVA is a family business based in Uruguay, with a distribution platform covering all of Latin America. The firm has 120 employees, and offers services to a network of independent financial advisers, wealth managers, and other establishments. Its assets under management total about USD800m. Old Mutual and AIVA have had a business relationship for over 15 years. The new agreement is expected to involve operational synergies between AIVA and the emerging markets unit of Old Mutual in Colombia and Mexico. As of the end of December 2011, assets under management at Old Mutual totalled GBP267bn.
