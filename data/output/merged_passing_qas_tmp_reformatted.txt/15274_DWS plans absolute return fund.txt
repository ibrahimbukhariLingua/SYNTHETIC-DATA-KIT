DWS plans absolute return fund


At a joint presentation in Munich with Edouard Carmignac, Klaus Kaldemorgen, who has quit his administrative functions as head of DWS (Deutsche Bank group) in order to focus on fund management, has told Newsmanagers that he is preparing an absolute return fund, a solution demanded by many investors “disappointed in outperformance which, despite everything, in reality worked out to overall losses, when funds had less negative results than their benchmark indices.” The risk manager recruited by DWS set out to base his models on three elements: single-digit returns, single-digit losses, and/or lesses which correspond to one third of those of the equities markets. The new product may be ready for launch in the next few months, and will certainly be launched by the end of this year.
