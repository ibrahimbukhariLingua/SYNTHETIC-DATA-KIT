Progress report on Basel III implementation


At its September 2011 meeting, the Basel Committee agreed to commence a process to review members’ implementation of Basel III. Full, timely and consistent implementation of Basel III will be fundamental to raising the resilience of the global banking system, in maintaining market confidence in regulatory ratios, and in providing a level playing field. The review process is intended to provide additional incentives for member jurisdictions to fully implement the standards within the agreed timelines. This report, as part of the process, provides an update on the regulatory adoption of Basel III by each Committee member. In addition, the Committee plans to review the consistency of members’ regulations with the internationally agreed standards. It also will review the consistency of the measurement of risk-weighted assets across banks and jurisdictons, covering both the banking book and the trading book. The outcome of these reviews will also be included in the updated version of this progress report when they become available. Lire la suite: cliquez ici
