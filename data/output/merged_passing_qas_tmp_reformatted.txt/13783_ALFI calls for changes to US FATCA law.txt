ALFI calls for changes to US FATCA law


The Luxembourg investment fund association (ALFI) has claimed in a statement released on 14 June that the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) in the version passed by the US government in March 2010, which is set to come into force on 1 January 2013, may drive European management firms into a long and costly series of adaptations, whose costs would be paid by clients (experts estimate a cose of USD40 per investor), at a time when US investors are hardly invested in European funds at all. Charles Muller, deputy director of ALFI, says that the association does not oppose FATCA, but that some concessions and a longer transition period should be allowed, while retaining the objective of the bill, namely to combat tax evasion in the United States. The law affects all funds which invest in the US market: providers of financial services, investment funds, management firms and foreign banks are required in their annual reports to declare US taxpayersâ€™ earnings to the US authorities, or to pay the US tax authorities a withholding tax of 30% on gross revenues, dividends and interest.
