Growing ETF industry faces regulatory uncertainty


Regulatory uncertainties may represent a sword of Damocles for the rapidly-growign ETF markets, according to a study by State Street Global Advisors, cited by Asian Investor. The rapid growth of the ETF market cannot conceal the fact that many products (commodity, inverse, leveraged and actively-managed products) are causing some concern among regulators. US regulators are asking questions about the future of commodities products, for example, particularly about the impact of speculative trading on underlying commodity prices. Though some commodity ETF funds invest in the physical commodities themselves, most use futures to replicate such an exposure, which may cause market distortions. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) may soon propose new regulations, according to the study. The CFTC is said to favour the introduction of limits to the size and market share of ETFs.
