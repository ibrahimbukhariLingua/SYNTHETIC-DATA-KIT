Gemway Assets gets its start with GemEquity fund


Bruno Vanier and Michel Audeban on 25 October officially launched their asset management firm, Gemway Assets, of which they are president and CEO, respectively, as Newsmanagers reported earlier this month. The presentation took place in the presence of Didier Le Menestrel, chairman of Financière de l’Echiquier, which controls 33.34% of capital, alongside BMVA, the holding company of Bruno Vanier and Michel Audeban (51.66%), and a group of 12 wealth management advisers to family offices (15%). Most of the presentation was dedicated to the first fund from Gemway Assets, GemEquity, which is managed by Vanier with Gerlel Majoros, formerly of Deka in Frankfurt, an then of UniCredito in London, until a third person can be recruited, which is expected during next year. With emerging markets as his chosen terrain, Vanier allies stock-picking mangement for two thirds of the portfolio with top-down management, with the help of two independent research organisations. In detail, the head limits the weight of cyclical stocks to one third of the fund, compared to 2/3 in indices, while the remaining two thirds are dedicated to investment in non-cyclical businesses. “This way,” says Vanier, “volatility is structurally lower.” For distribution, Gemway Assets is placing the emphasis on independent financial advisers, and is now listed on 20 platforms. However, the asset management firm is planning to approach institutional investors, and to enter international markets, where the firm can count on several investor “friends.” GemEquity currently has assets of EUR50m, of which EUR10m are from Financière de l’Echiquier, and has set an objective of EUR100m by the end of next year.
