Goldman Sachs has potential conflict of interest in Whitehall funds


In a market environment in which commercial real estate prices have plunged, external investors in the Whitehall real estate fund from Goldman Sachs are beginning to consider conflicts of interest, the Wall Street Journal reports. They point out that Goldman Sachs, which is both an investor in, lender to, and manager of the fund (and which thus earns the management commissions) is in a position to profit from the situation to the detriment of outside investors. In 18 years, Goldman Sachs has raised USD31bn for the various Whitehall funds, external investors providing two third or more of this total. Theseâ€¯?opportunity funds? are high-leverage vehicles financed by Goldman Sachs, its employees, and outside subscribers.Currently, problems are emerging in relation to capital losses on Nevada casinos, a hotel chain (Equity Inns), and 36 properties acquired from DEGI in Germany.
