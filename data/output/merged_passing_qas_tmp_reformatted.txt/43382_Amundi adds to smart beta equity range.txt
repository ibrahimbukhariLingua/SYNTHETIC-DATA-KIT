Amundi adds to smart beta equity range


Amundi ETF is extending its Smart Beta equity range on the theme of ‘Buyback,’ with the launch of the AMUNDI ETF MSCI EUROPE BUYBACK UCITS ETF in the next few days, the first ETF in Europe to be exposed to the MSCI Europe Equal Weighted Buyback Yield strategy.The ETF is aimed at investors seeking to benefit from potential returns on European equity marktes via a Smart Beta approach. This provides access to new sources of returns through exposure to businesses which practice equity repurchasing policies, a method of distribution of revenue which may gain momentum in Europe.The MSCI Europe Equal Weighted Buyback Yield strategy index reflects the performance of stocks of the MSCI Europe index which have implemented a buyback programme within the past 12 months, with a buyback ratio of over 10 basis points. In addition, it applies an equal weighting medhodology which makes it possible to diversify exposure to the Buyback theme, and to avoid the concentration bias on the largest shares implementing equity repurchasing.Followiing on the creation of an ETF for equity buyback programmes by US companies, and to meet growing interest in this theme on the part of investors, Amundi ETF is launching this new exposure to European equities with a TER of 0.30%.
