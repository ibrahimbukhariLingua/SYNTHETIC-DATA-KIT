State Street renames ETFs


State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) on 28 June announced that the names of its tracker funds domiciled in France have been changed to include the brand name used for all its global product range, SPDR®. Tracker products from SSgA, which were previously known by the name TRACKS®, are now registered and listed under the SPDR brand name. The funds are currently registered in France, Germany, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and SSgA is planning to register the funds in several other countries. The new name is extended to the full range of 13 ETF products from SSgA domiciled in France, including European regional and sectoral funds. The funds are currently traded on NYSE Euronext. In addition to the name change, SSgA has updated other aspects of the funds, lowering the total TER ratio, and improving the liquidity provisions. SSgA has also set up a dedicated team in London, and launched a new website dedicated to ETFs in Europe, at http://www.spdrseurope.com/.
