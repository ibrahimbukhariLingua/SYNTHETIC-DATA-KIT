Mapfre sees 7.6% rise in assets in 2016


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } In the 2016 fiscal year, assets under management by the Mapfre group, including pension funds, mutual funds and investment portfolios, posted a 7.6% increase, to a total of EUR58.87bn, the Spanish insurer announced on 8 February at a presentation of its annual results. This increase was driven by a “rally on bond markets during the year, positive growth of pension funds and mutual funds, appreciation of the Brazilian real of +25.8%, and the acquisition of the life insurance activity in Portugal by Bankinter Vida,” Mapfre says in a statement. Bankinter Seguros de Vida, a company jointly owned by Mapfre and Bankinter, acquired the life insurance activity of Barclays in Portugal in early 2016. Assets in mutual funds and pension funds totalled EUR9.31bn as of the end of 2016, compared with EUR8.42bn as of the end of 2015, an increase of 10.6%. Meanwhile, other assets under management at the group (inncluding technical reserves and life insurance) totalled EUR49.55bn as of the end of 2016, compared with EUR46.26bn, up by 7.1%. At the conclusion of the 2016 fiscal year, the Mapfre group earned net profits of EUR775.5m, up 9.4% over one year. Annual earnings totalled EUR27bn, up 1.5% compared with 2015.
