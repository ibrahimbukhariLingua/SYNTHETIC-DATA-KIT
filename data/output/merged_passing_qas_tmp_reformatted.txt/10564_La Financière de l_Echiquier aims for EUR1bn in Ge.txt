La Financière de l’Echiquier aims for EUR1bn in German assets


The French asset management firm La Financière de l’Echiquier has set itself an ambitious goal, the Börsen-Zeitung reports: “In the mid to long-term,” says Didier Le Menestrel, its founder and president, the firm is aiming for assets of EUR1bn in Germany, up from EUR100m currently. After all, he adds, it might be ambitious, but the firm will have needed 10 years to reach EUR200m in assets under management in France.
