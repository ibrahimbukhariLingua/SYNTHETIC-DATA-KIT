Axa in negotiations to sell off some UK activities


In a press statement, AXA confirmed on Monday, 14 June, that it is in talks with Resolution Ltd. for a potential sale of some of its life, savings, and retirement activities in the United Kingdom. Once the deal is finalised, AXA would retain AXA Wealth Management and AXA Direct Protection, and sell the remainder of its UK activities to Resolution Ltd. Axa states that the activities of AXA Wealth Management include the Elevate sales platform, Architas Multi-Manager, AXA Isle of Man and the investment and retirement savings specialist activities of AXA Winterthur Wealth Management.

Of this amount, GBP2.25bn (about EUR2.7bn) would be payable in cash, while senior preferred dividend shares would account for GBP0.5bn (about EUR0.6bn).
