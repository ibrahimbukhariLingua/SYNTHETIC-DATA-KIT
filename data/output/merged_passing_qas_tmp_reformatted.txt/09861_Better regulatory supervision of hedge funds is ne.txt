Better regulatory supervision of hedge funds is needed


The Joint Forum, which includes several supervisory bodies, on 7 January published a series of recommendations which aim to reinforce surveillance of the financial sector, particularly hedge funds. The Forum, which brings together the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Basel committee for banking supervision, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), is responding to a request from the G20 to identify areas which were not yet adequately taken into account in terms of problematics related to systemic risks. Among the 17 recommendations for measures to fill lacunae which became apparent during the crisis are increased surveillance of risks posed by hedge funds. In parallel with the work undertaken by IOSCO on hedge funds, the tripartite Forum points to the need for increased transparency of hedge funds, to identify potential risks, to the need to introduce minimal standards in risk management, and to establish linimal ownersâ€™ equity requirements for firms which have high systemic risk.
