QVT sues Commerzbank


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The hedge fund management firm QVT has filed a suit in a Delaware court against Commerzbank, seeking USD68m in damages, the BÃ¶rsen-Zeitung reports. Eurohypo, an affiliate of Commerzbank, in June refused to pay interest on USD226m invested by QVT in two subordinated Tier 1 issues placed in the United States, and dividend-right certificates held by QVT, on the grounds that Eurohypo ran at a loss in 2009. The European Commission forbids all banks which have received government assistance, which includes Commerzbank, from paying interest on hybrid capital if they show losses.
