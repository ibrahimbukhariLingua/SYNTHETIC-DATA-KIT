ING IM to launch two specialised funds


ING Investment Mangement will in April launch two funds which will give UK and European investors larger access to its debt strategies, Investment Week reports. One of them will be an Asian high return corporate bond fund, which will replicate a fund dedicated to Japanese investors. It will be managed by Joep Huntjens, head of Asian debt at ING IM. The firm is also creating a European version of its ABS fund based in the Netherlands. The product will meet the requirements of the AIFM directive, and will be managed by Calvin Davies and Annemieke Aoldeweijer. It will receive a capital contribution of EUR250m from the Netherlands fund.
