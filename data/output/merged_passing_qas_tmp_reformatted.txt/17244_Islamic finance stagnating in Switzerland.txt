Islamic finance stagnating in Switzerland


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Agefi Switzerland reports that the private banking sector in Switzerland is seeing limited demand for Sharia-compliant financial products. Pictet & Cie launched a thematic fund based on the methods of Islamic finance two years ago, and closed it last year. “There is an inexplicable scepticism on the part of Geneva private banks about giving a mandate to a consulting firm specialised in Sharia-compliant investment. As of now, no major institution of this type which is respected internationally is yet established in Switzerland, though they are in London and Luxembourg,” says John Sandwick, independent manager in Geneva, cited by the newspaper.
