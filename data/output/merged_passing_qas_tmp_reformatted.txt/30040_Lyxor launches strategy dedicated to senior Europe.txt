Lyxor launches strategy dedicated to senior European debt


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } Lyxor is offering a new investment strategy in senior European debt, “Lyxor European Senior Debt,” which will be released by the British affiliate of Lyxor, Lyxor AM announced on 22 May at a press conference.The LBO loans market is not highly trafficked by institutional investors, who are generally exposed to senior loans via collateralized loan obligations (CLO). “The asset class is not highly present among institutionals, but the market is rather large to construct diversified portfolios,” says Thierry de Vergnes, head of debt management at Lyxor AM. The European loan market was driven by 245 businesses in 2011 and 2012, which borrowed a total of about EUR72bn. In first quarter 2013, EUR15bn in loans were issued.The financial crisis has resulted in the emergence of more favourable conditions for purchasers of loans at a time when investment capacity in CLOs is in the process of fading away. Weaker demand by European CLOs, whose reinvestment periods are generally maturing, and higher capital needs on the part of banks have led to an increase in margins on primary issues. This improvement in investment conditions has modified the investor base, as debt funds and direct investors are gradually replacing CLOs and banks. A considerable advantage compared with high yield bonds which have a set coupon is that loans have variable rate coupons, which represent partial coverage in the event of a rise in interest rates.The strategy offered by Lyxor, whose capacity may reach EUR200m, aims to generate annual returns 6% to 7% above the Eurbor 3-month rate on a 6 to 8 year horizon. Retail shares will aim to deliver annual revenues of approximately the Euribor 3-month +5%.
