Catella launches real estate fund focused on Munich


The Catella MAX fund, launched by Catella Real Estate AG KAG (an affiliate of the Swedish Catella group), will be the first German-registered open-ended real estate fund to be focused exclusively on a single city or region. The city will be Munich and its adjacent Landkreise or districts. The product will have a highly diversified sectoral portfolio, which will include a high proportion of residential properties, and will be aimed at retail as well as smaller institutional investors.
