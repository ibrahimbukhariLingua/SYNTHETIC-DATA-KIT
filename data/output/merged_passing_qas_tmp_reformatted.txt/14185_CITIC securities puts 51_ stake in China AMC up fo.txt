CITIC securities puts 51% stake in China AMC up for sale


Currently, CITIC Securities owns 100% of the largest fund management firm in China, China AMC (CNY224bn in assets), in contravention of local law, which forbids ownership of a stake of over 50%. Since January 2010, China AMC has been barred from launching new funds, as its shareholder structure was not in compliance with legislation.Z-Ben Advisors reports on 25 May that CITIC Securities has now received permission to sell 51% of its affiliate, for which it is asking CNY7.56bn. However, it is possible that the sale will be made in several lots (up to five), due to the high price that CITIC Securities is seeking.On the basis of assets under management as of the end of March, the asking price represents 6.61% of asset volumes; on the basis of 2010 profits, it corresponds to a ratio of 14.82 times profits, which may appear high, but should be considered in the context of expected high growth, as China AMC is extremely well positioned in the sector.
