Madoff: Trustee may appeal J.P. Morgan verdict


Irving Picard, the trustee appointed by the courts to recover funds for victims of Bernard Madoff, has been granted clearance to appeal the verdict in a legal action against J.P. Morgan Chase, with nearly USD20bn at stake, the Wall Street Journal reports. In November, US Federal judge Colleen McMahon found that Picard did not have a standing against J.P. Morgan Chase.
