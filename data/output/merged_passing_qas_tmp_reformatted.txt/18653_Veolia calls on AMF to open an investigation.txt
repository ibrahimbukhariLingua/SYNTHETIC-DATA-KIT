Veolia calls on AMF to open an investigation


The global leader in water, Veolia Environnement, on 29 October called on the French financial market regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) to open an investigation into “dissemination of false information,” following a report in the press claiming that it was planning to increase its capital to at least EUR1bn. “Baseless information has been disseminated since 26 October suggesting that Veolia Environnement is planning to increase its capital by at least EUR1bn. In reaction, Veolia Environnement denies that it is planning a capital increase,” the group says in a statement. “Veolia Environnement has asked the Autorité des marchés financiers to open an investigation into this dissemination of false information,” it says.
