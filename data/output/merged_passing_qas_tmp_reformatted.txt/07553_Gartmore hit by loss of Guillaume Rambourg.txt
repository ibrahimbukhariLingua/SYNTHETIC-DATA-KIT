Gartmore hit by loss of Guillaume Rambourg


Gartmore has seen a decline in its assets from GBP22.2bn as of the end of 2009 to GBP19.9bn as of the end of June, following an increase to GBP23.5bn as of the end of March. The drop is primarily due to the suspension of its star manager Guillaume Rambourg in March, and his subsequent departure. “That provoked withdrawals, primarily for the European Absolute Return fund managed by the team, and then in early May, for European hedge funds,” the British management firm says. European long only equity funds also saw outflows due to falling markets. In total, for first half, Gartmore has seen net redemptions of GBP1.8bn. In July, the management has seen further outflows of GBP238m, but its assets climbed back to GBP20.3bn. The firm expects that its assets will be lower in second half than in first half, which will result in reduced revenues from management fees. Despite these factors, in first half, net earnings rose 36% to GBP113.2m, and EBITDA was up 146% to GBP38.8m.
