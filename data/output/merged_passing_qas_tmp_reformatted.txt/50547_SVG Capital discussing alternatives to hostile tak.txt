SVG Capital discussing alternatives to hostile takeover of HarbourVest


In the wake of rumours in the press, the private equity firm SVG Capital, facing a hostile takeover bid from the US firm HarbourVest, on Monday morning confirmed that it is in talks with an arm of Goldman Sachs and the Canadian pension fund CPPIB “as members of a consortium for a possible alternative transaction for SVG Capital.”Over the weekend, the press had reported that the two firms were considering a bid of about GBP1bn for the assets of the fund, but not for the company itself.On 16 September, SVG Capital had already announced at a release of its interim results that it was rejecting an unsolicited bid from its American rival HarbourVest, on the grounds that it undervalued the firm. “A party other than the one mentioned in the announcement of 16 September has approached the board of directors to make an offer, on the condition that it find a partner to form a consortium,” SVG Capital states, adding that a third investor may also make a bid for the firm. The bid from HarbourVest expires on 6 October, and has been set at 650 pence per share, for a valuation of GBP1.02bn.
