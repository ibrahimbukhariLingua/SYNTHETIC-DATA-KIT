SAM kicks off annual screening of companies for sustainable development


The Swiss firm SAM Sustainable Asset Management, an affiliate of Robeco, announced on Wednesday that it is launching its twelfth annual operation to evaluate the world’s major corporations in terms of economic, ecological, and social criteria. The questionnaire, which covers 100 topics, will be sent out to the 2,500 largest companies in the world on the basis of the volume of publicly traded capital. The analysis of the firms from a sustainable development standpoint will allow the firms which receive the highest scores to be included in the sectoral Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI). SAM states that, in the period from 2001 to 2008, the “sustainability leaders” in its rankings earned performance on average 148 basis points p.a. higher than those of the “sustainability laggards.”
