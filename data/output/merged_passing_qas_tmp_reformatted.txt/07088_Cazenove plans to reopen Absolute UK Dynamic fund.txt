Cazenove plans to reopen Absolute UK Dynamic fund


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The British management firm Cazenove is planning to reopen its absolute return fund, Absolute UK Dynamic, which has recovered after several difficult months, next year, Investment Week reports. The fund, launched on 7 September 2009, was closed one week later after inflows of GBP130m. This year, net redemptions reduced assets in the fund to GBP69m, in the wake of the departure of Neil Pegrum in April. According to the fundâ€™s manager, Paul Marriage, the product has in the past few months got back on course to meet its objective of annual returns of 10%, with performance of 1% in July, 2.2% in August, and 1% in September. Over the past three months, the fund shows gains of 2.5%, compared with an average of 1% for the sector (Morningstar). But for the year to 13 September, the fund shows losses of 5.9%, compared with gains of 3.5% for the IMA Absolute Return sector.
