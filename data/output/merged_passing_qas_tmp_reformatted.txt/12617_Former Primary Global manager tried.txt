Former Primary Global manager tried


The trial of James Fleishman begins this Wednesday in New York, the Financial Times reports. Fleishman, who was a sales manager at Primary Global, is answering charges that between 2008 and 2010, he belonged to a network which put hedge fund clients in contact with company insiders.The government has provided evidence including instant messages between employees of Primary Global and employees of the hedge fund management firms Balyasny Asset Management, Coatue Management, Janus Capital, SAC Capital and Diamondback. These firms have not been charged with wrongdoing. The case may also point the spotlight at other clients of Primary Global, such as Loch Capital and Level Global, which have been subpoenaed, but have not been charged with wrongdoing.
