p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Citizen Capital, an investment fund specialised in impact investing, on 16 January announced that it has completed fundraising for its Citizen Capital II fund with EUR43m, doubling the size of its previous fund, it says in a statement. The firm, launched in 2008 by Laurence Méhaignerie and Pierre-Olivier Barennes, now has EUR65m in assets under management. The vast majority of the first investors in Citizen Capital (bpifrance, CNP Assurances, AG2R La Mondiale, Amundi, Agrica, and others) have participated in this fundraising. They are joined by new institutional investors, including the European Investment Fund (EIF), Mirova (an affiliate of Natixis), SMA BTP, the Etablissement pour la Retraite Additionnelle de la Fonction Publique (ERAFP) and the job revitalisation fund. “10 entrepreneurs and family offices have also subscribed to the fund,” the investment firm says. Like its predecessor, the Citizen Capital II fund will pursue an investment strategy which “targets fast-growing small and mid-sized enterprises (SME) or startups which hope to take on major social or environmental challenges.” The vehicle will invest up to EUR4m in companies whose earnings vary from EUR1m to EUR50m. Citizen Capital II has already structured fundraising rounds for OpenClassrooms (EUR6m), a specialist in online education, and Ulule (EUR5m), a player in crowdfunding and donations.
