Inocap launches two new funds


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; }a:link { } Inocap Gestion, with assets under management totalling about EUR400m, is starting out 2017 with the launch of two new funds. First of all, this includes the creation of a new FCP, Quadrige Europe, which will extend its expertise, previously limited to French small cap companies to SMEs. To meet the demands of this development, Pierrick Bouchet, CEO, manager and founding partner, on 7 March said at a statement that he had build a new network of foreign correspondent banks, including Carnegie and Danske Bank to cover Scandinavia, and Warburg and DAB Bank for the German market. Quadrige Europe is dedicated to innovative European SMBs, most often leaders in their markets. The fund invests by preference in companies which distribute dividends on a regular basis, and whose involved family shareholding structure ensures a long-term industrial vision. The fund was launched internally in late 2015. It now has over EUR12m in assets under management, and performance as of 6 March 2017 of over 31%. Returns in 2016 totalled 23.81%, with volatility of 13.3%. The newly-released fund is based on conviction-based management, decorrelated from indices. The other offer is a wealth tax (ISF) optimised fund entitled FCPI Qi2017, licensed by the French AMF on 9 December 2016. It aims to finance French innovative SMEs, most of them publicly traded. In light of past millennia, the FCPI has no sectoral constraints. The subscription period for the fund, to reduce ISF taxes in 2017, will run until mid-June.
