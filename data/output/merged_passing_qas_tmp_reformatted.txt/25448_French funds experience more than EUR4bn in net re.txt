French funds experience more than EUR4bn in net redemptions


French-registered funds have posted net outflows of EUR4bn in November. According to statistics from Europerformance, a SIX company, this movement is largely due to treasury (money market) funds, which have posted net outflows of EUR3.54bn, leading to a decline in assets in this asset class of 0.96%. Equity funds have not seen much in inflows either, with net redemptions of EUR521.7m. However, positive performance effects for this asset class (+0.90%) have allowed assets to increase by 0.67%. For their part, bond funds have shown strong inflows, with net subscriptions total EUR1.20bn. Inflow effects in addition to market appreciation (0.19%) have allowed assets to increase by 1.39%. Convertible bond funds have posted net inflows of EUR37m. With flat performance, the increase in assets is 0.33%.
