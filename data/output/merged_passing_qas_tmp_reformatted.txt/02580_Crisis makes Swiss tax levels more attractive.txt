Crisis makes Swiss tax levels more attractive


L’Agefi Switzerland reports that the international rankings of the “Individual Income Tax Rate Survey 2009,” published yesterday by KPMG, reveal that the impact of the financial recession on taxation have made Switzerland more attractive compared to other countries. Compared with 2008, it has gained five places, putting it in 13thplace in the rankings, revealing that tax pressure is mounting in the worst-affected countries, such as Ireland, Iceland, and Great Britain. Since Switzerland has not seen any increase in the maximal income tax rate, “developments in the four corners of the globe may make the country even more attractive in terms of taxation,” KPMG says.
