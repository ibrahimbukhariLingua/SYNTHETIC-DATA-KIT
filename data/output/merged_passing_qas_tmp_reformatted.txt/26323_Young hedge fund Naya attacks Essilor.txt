Young hedge fund Naya attacks Essilor


The hedge fund Naya estimates that the share price of Essilor, in which it holds a short stake, is worth EUR60, compared with nearly EUR77 currently, due to inadequate organic growth and rising competition in the future, the firm announced at an annual hedge fund conference, the Sohn Conference, in London, Les Echos reports. The young fund, launched in 2012, has been one of the emblematic launches of the past 18 months in equities. Its founder, Masroor Siddiqi, is a former employee of the activist fund The Childrenâ€™s Investment fund (TCI). Naya, which has over USD1bn, is supported by the highly influential investor Blackstone, which has invested its own money. The hedge fund is enthusiastic, however, about the luxuries group Salvatore Ferragamo, a share which it feels is worth at least EUR35, compared with EUR25 currently.
