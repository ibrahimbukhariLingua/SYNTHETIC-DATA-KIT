Refinancing needs set to balloon for non-financial sector businesses


Businesses outside the financial sector rated investment grade (IG) in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) will see their refinancing needs increase to over USD1.2trn (EUR876bn) in the next four years, according to a study published on 9 November by the ratings agency Moody’s («EMEA Invesment-Grade Companies Face Higher Refunding Risks and Needs in 2012-15»). The three most affected sectors will be telecommunications, energy and automotive.Of this total of USD1.2trn in debt, to mature between 2012 and 2015, the needs of banks represent only 32% (compared with 37% in June 2010), in a sign of a gradual trend away from intermediation and increasing use of capital markets by businesses, the agency notes. In addition, “the percentage of bank debt is decreasing, while maturities are getting longer.”Moody’s also reports that investor demand for investment-grade corporate debt has decreased slightly since the beginning of the year. A flight to quality remains a strong trend, but any issue activity observed since mid-year shows that the market has been affected by the sovereign debt crisis and deterioration of the economic environment. That said, many businesses have more comfortable padding in their treasuries. As of the end of second quarter 2011, corporate investment grade issuers in the EMEA region had more than USD690bn in cash, up 17% compared with June 2010.
