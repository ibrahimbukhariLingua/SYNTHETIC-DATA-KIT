Hedge-fund manager John Paulson personally netted more than USD5 billion in profits in 2010—trumping the nearly USD4 billion he made with his «short» bets against subprime mortgages in 2007, according to The Wall Street Journal. Appaloosa Management founder David Tepper and Bridgewater Associates chief Ray Dalio each personally gained between USD2 billion and USD3 billion last year, according to investors and people familiar with the situation. James Simons, founder of Renaissance Technologies LLC, also produced profits in that range.
