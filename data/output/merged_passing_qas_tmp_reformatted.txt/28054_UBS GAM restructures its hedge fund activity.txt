UBS GAM restructures its hedge fund activity


UBS Global Asset Management on 22 August announced that it is restructuring its hedge fund platform with immediate effect. The platform dedicated to alternative and quantitative investments will be divided into two separate units, one of which will be dedicated to multi-manager hedge fund activities, entitled Alternative Investment Solutions (AIS), while the other will include single-manager hedge fund activities under the name O’Connor. The AIS unit will be led by Bill Ferri, who is expected to add to the existing range in the alternative universe. The other unit, O’Conner, will be led by Dawn Fitzpatrick, who already serves as chief investment officer. Fitzpatrick will join the executive board at GAM and will report directly to John Fraser, chairman and CEO of UBS GAM. Assets under management at AIS, which has offices in Stamford, Connecticut, USA, London, Zurich, Hong King and Tokyo, total USD25.4bn. Assets under management at O’Connor, a unit specialised in absolute returns, with offices in Chicago, London, New York and Singapore, total USD5.2bn.
