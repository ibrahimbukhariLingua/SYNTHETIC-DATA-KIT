Mirabaud buys a stake in Venture Finanzas


The Swiss bank Mirabaud has signed an agreement to buy a minority stake in venture Finanzas, a Spanish firm specialised in brokerage, analysis, management and sales of investment funds. The investment, whose total amount has not been disclosed, allows the Swiss firm a point of entry into the Spanish market. “Spain is an important European market for our strategic activities,” says Thierry Fauchier-Magnan, partner and chairman of the executive board at Mirabaud. “Our development priorities for the next five years are domestic private clients, institutionals, brokerage and corporate finance, and product distribution,” he adds. The minority investment is only a first step, as Mirabaud is planning to increase its stake so as to become a majority stakeholder by mid-2010. The goal is to integrate the Venture Finanzas product range (which consists of several funds and Sicav products). “Our aim is for Venture’s activities to be conducted under the Mirabaud brand name by the middle of next year,” says Antonio Palma, managing partner and member of the executive board at the Swiss firm.
