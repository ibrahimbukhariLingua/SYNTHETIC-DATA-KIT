EIIB-Rasmala adds to Sharia-compliant range


The financial group EIIB-Rasmala, specialised largely in asset management and listed on the AIM in London, is adding to its Sharia-compliant product range with the launch of a new fund, the Rasmala Trade Finance Fund, Funds Europe reports. The fund will invest in a transaction portfolio of trade finance exposed to various regions and sectors in order to reduce exposure to rising interest rates. EIIB-Rasmala, which this year has already launched several Sharia-compliant funds, is aiming for assets of over USD2bn in these new vehicles.
