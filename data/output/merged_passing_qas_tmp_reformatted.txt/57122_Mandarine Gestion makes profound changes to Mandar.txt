Mandarine Gestion makes profound changes to Mandarine Europe Opportunities fund


Five years after its creation, the Mandarine Europe Opportunities fund is changing brackets. In a letter addressed to shareholders, Mandarine Gestion has announced a decision to change the name of the fund, to make it Mandarine Active. This change will take effect from 1 December 2017, the firm says in the document. The name change will be accompanied by a change in investment strategy. Mandarine Europe Opportunities had previously invested in European growth style equities. “The fund aims to select companies which achieve higher than average growth in their results and their margins, and which show valuation potential,” Mandarine Gestion says. It mainly targets issuers in the European Union. “The fund will now invest in securities from euro zone issuers,” the asset management firm says. Another major change is that the proportion of the fund invested in small cap equities is increased from 10% to a maximum of 25%. “Maximum ‘equity’ exposure, previously 120%, is now 100%” Mandarine Gestion adds. The fund, which had hitherto been able to use leveraged derivative instruments in its portfolio, for activities, sectors, equities, currencies or market indices, or to hedge “equity” risk, will no longer use derivative instruments in future. The fund is also changing AMF classification. Where it had previously been classified as “equities from European Union countries” the fund is now classified as “equities from euro zone countries.” As a result, the reference index for the fund is modified, with the Euro Stoxx Net Return index substituted for Stoxx Europe 600 NR, the asset management firm indicates. Lastly, in addition to traditional financial criteria, “non-binding environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria may also be taken into account by managers, at their discretion,” Mandarine Gestion says in a letter to shareholders.
