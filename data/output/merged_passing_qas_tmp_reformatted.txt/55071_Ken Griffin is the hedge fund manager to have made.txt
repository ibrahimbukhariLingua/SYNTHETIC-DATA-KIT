Ken Griffin is the hedge fund manager to have made the most money in 2015


Ken Griffin, head of the Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel, has topped the rankings by Forbes of hedge fund managers and traders who made the most money in 2015. Griffin personally made USD1.7bn last year. For the first time, Griffin has made more than the old titans of the hedge fund universe, such as George Soros, Steve Cohen and David Tepper, says Forbes, who add that the asset management firm has USD25bn in assets under management. Griffin is followed by James Simons, of Renaissance Techologies, who made USD1.65bn, and by Steve Cohen of Point72 Asset Management, who made USD1.55bn in gains. The list of 2015 billionaires ends with David Tepper, of Appaloosa Management, who made USD1.2bn. In 2014, the rankings had been dominated by Cohen, Ray Dalio and Soros. Collectively, the 25 hedge fund managers and traders figuring in the rankings earned EUR12bn in 205, slightly under the USD12.5bn pocketed in 2014.
