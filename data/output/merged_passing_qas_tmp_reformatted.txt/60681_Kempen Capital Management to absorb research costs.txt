Kempen Capital Management to absorb research costs


Under the new European Union legislation package of measures for the financial markets, MiFID II, Kempen Capital Management (Kempen) must decide whether or not they will pass on the cost of external investment research to clients: to funds participants and mandates. Kempen has decided to cover external investment research costs itself. Despite the fact that in the future, these costs may be passed on under strict conditions, Kempen has decided that starting from 2018, it will cover the cost of external investment research itself.
