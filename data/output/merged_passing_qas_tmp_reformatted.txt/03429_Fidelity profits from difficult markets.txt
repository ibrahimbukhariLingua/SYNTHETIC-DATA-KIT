Fidelity profits from difficult markets


In an interview with Financial Times Fund Management, Thomas Balk, head of Japanese activities at Fidelity Investments, says the US asset management firm is profiting from difficult market conditions. Since July, it has brought in USD2.3bn in flows from existing and new clients. “What they’re realising is that volatile markets like this really separate the good managers from the bad much more clearly,” says Mr Balk. Fidelity has been present in Japan for 40 years.
