S&amp;P puts UBS on RWN


The ratings agency Standard & Poor’s (S&P) on 16 September announced that it may become the next agency to lower its long-term debt rating for the Swiss bank UBS, due to fraud which has recently been uncovered in the business bank. Moody’s on Thursday announced that it was considering a similar move.The ratings agency has placed the A+ long-term debt rating for the Zurich-based establishment on ratings watch with a negative outlook (RWN), following the discovery of fraud by a UBS trader who lost the firm USD2bn, which may lead to a loss in third quarter.The Fitch ratings agency, for its part, has confirmed its long-term debt issuer (IDR) rating of A+ and short-term rating of F1+ for the business. The long-term rating has been given a stable outlook. The fraud, however, represents a serious setback for UBS’ efforts to win back the confidence of clients in its business banking activities, Fitch says.
