Altarius AM launches an investment platform based in Malta


Altarius Asset Management Limited, the asset management affiliate of the Altarius Group, based in Malta, at the end of last week announced that it has launched its investment platform, Paragon Sicav plc (Paragon), which is one of the first independent investment platforms in Malta created exclusively for third-party managers and family offices. Paragon, which is registered as a P.I.F. (professional investment fund), is described as extremely flexible in terms of investment strategy, liquidity, reporting, and debt. One of the major advantages of Paragon is that it is exempt from income and capital gains taxes. Among its other strong points, Paragon has an open architecture, which allows clients to name their own service provider. As a collective investment organism, it is also highly profitable, as creation and maintenance costs are distributed between all the sub-funds on the platform. Paragon does not impose a minimal portfolio, nor a lock-up period.
