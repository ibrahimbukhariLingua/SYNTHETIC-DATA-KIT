High yield bond funds deserted by investors


Troubles related to Greek debt have exacerbated the risk aversion of investors, who in mid-June pulled out of the high yield bond sector, in favour of funds dedicated to US equities.In the week to 15 June, high yield bond funds suffered a record net outflow of USD2.09bn, according to the most recent weekly statistics from EPFR Global. Bond funds overall still showed a net inflow of USD679m in the week under review.Equities funds attracted over USD6bn, while inflows to a group of US ETF funds, stimulated by a series of options which matured on 17 June, more than compensated for redemptions from the major groups of equities funds. Funds dedicated to European equities finished the week with outflows of USD741m.Money market funds also saw their largest outflows in over four months.In terms of sectors, funds dedicated to health and biotechnologies continued to post subscriptions, putting inflows since the beginning of the year at over USD3bn.
