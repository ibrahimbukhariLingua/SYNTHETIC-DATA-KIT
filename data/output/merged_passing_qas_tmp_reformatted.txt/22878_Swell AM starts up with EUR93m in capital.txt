Swell AM starts up with EUR93m in capital


Swell Asset Management, dedicated to tactical asset allocation, whose foundation Newsmanagers announced on 11 January 2012, has announced that it began its activities on 27 March with the transfer of the Swell Soft GTAA Fund (formerly the LFP Allocation 3). The fund, whose assets total EUR93m, had since its inception in 2005 been managed by Olivier Ramé and Jean-Philippe Collin, the two founders of Swell AM, who were then head of alternative management and a manager, respectively, at La Française des Placements. The French regulator has also issued a license for the creation of the Swell Classic GTAA Fund, a second fund, also in UCITS IV format, which uses the same investment strategy but in a more aggressive mode. Swell Asset Management received its portfolio management firm license from the French regulator on 1 March 2012. Ramé and Collin each own 37.5% of capital in the firm, while La Française AM controls the remaining 25%. In addition to this capital relationship, La Française AM is also making operational infrastructure (IT, middle office, offices, etc.) available to the young asset management firm.
