Aberdeen preparing a new Asian real estate fund of funds


Since 2006, Puay Ju Kang has been head of the Asia-Pacific real estate team at Aberdeen (USD1bn in assets), after working for a Dutch pension fund and one of the Singapore sovereign funds. On a visit to Paris, she explained to Newsmanagers that the group has previously offered its variuos products exclusively in Europe. Now, the British management firm has begun soft marketing for a third fund of funds, which will be a Luxembourg-registered fund intended for sale in Europe as well as in Asia-Pacific and North America. The launch is slated for April. A first closing may take place at USD100m in second or third quarter, and the fund may easily reach USD300-400m in assets. It would be hard closed at USD600m. Puay explains that Aberdeen will avoid products from major management firms, and will concentrate on funds with USD500-600m in assets, whicha re easier to control, “because we don’t want to be passive allocators,” she says. It must be ensured that the management firms have the necessary execution capacities.
