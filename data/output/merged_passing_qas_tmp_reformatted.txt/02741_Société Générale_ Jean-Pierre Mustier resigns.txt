Société Générale: Jean-Pierre Mustier resigns


In a statement dated 6 August, Société Générale has announced that it has received a letter of observation from the French market regulator, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), following an investigation begun in January 2008 into financial information and the share price of Société Générale. The letter, which concludes the AMF investigation, does not announce the opening of any cases before the sanctions commission. However, the statement says, Société Générale has been informed by Robert Day, administrator of the Group, and Jean-Pierre Mustier, a member of the Executive Board, “they they have received letters of grievance declaring that cases have been initiated before the AMF sanctions commission, for abuse of insider information. The accusations are contested by Day and Mustier. Though he was slated to leave Société Générale once the merger of SGAM and CAAM had been completed, and on 31 December 2009 at the latest, Mustier, head of the asset management unit, has chosen, in light of the AMF procedure underway, to make an earlier departure, and has submitted his immediate resignation, which has been accepted. The firm announces that he will be replaced by Sévérin Cabannes, who will also replace Mustier in his capacity as deputy CEO.
