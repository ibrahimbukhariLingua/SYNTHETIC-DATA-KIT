AllianceBernstein sues former financial advisers


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } AllianceBernstein has filed lawsuits against several financial advisers who left the group, and who, the firm says, are seeking to take its clients with them, the Wall Street Journal reports. Since the beginning of 2011, the asset management firm has sued 10 former advisers before the Manhattan Supreme Court, against none in 2010. Some lawyers view the suits as a warning to top-performing independent financial advisers still employed at the private clients unit of AllianceBernstein, but who have been discouraged by its recent performance. Clients withdrew USD3.2bn in fourth quarter last year, and analysts are predicting a further decline in first quarter.
