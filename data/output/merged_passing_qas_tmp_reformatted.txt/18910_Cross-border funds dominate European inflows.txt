Cross-border funds dominate European inflows


Since the financial crisis of 2007, cross-border funds have taken the lead from domestic funds in terms of inflows, while the two categories of funds were at similar levels previously. The example of 2012 speaks volumes, as cross-border funds have posted inflows of over EUR100bn, while domestic funds have taken in less than EUR25bn, In 2011, only cross-border funds showed inflows. “The reason for this difference lies in the distribution channels for various funds,” Detlef Glow, head of Lipper EMEA Research, explained at a press conference held by Fitch Ratings. Domestic funds are generally sold to retail investors by banking networks, while cross-border funds are aimed at sophisticaed investors. Banks are now tending to offer products other than funds to their clients. The other reason is also related to the fact that cross-border funds, which are often managed by British or American asset management firms, have a “global” bias in their investments, which is currently popular with investors. Overall, in 2011, 40% of assets in European funds were in cross-border funds, compared with 20% in 2001. But although the cake may be getting larger, the number of actors taking a slice is not high. Nearly 75% of inflows from 2009 to 2012 went to only 10 asset management firms.
