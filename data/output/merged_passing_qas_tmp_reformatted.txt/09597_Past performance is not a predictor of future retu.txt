Past performance is not a predictor of future returns


Advisor Perspectives, an electronic newsletter for independent financial advisers, in December published a study which suggests that Morningstar star ratings, which are based on past returns, are not that valuable for predicting performance in the future. Moreover, many funds with five-star ratings are likely to underperform compared with their counterparts. The Wall Street Journal cites several more studies which cast doubt on the value of past performance as a predictor, and on the abilities of fund managers to predict their future results.
