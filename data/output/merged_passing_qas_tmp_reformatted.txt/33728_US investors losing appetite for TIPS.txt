US investors losing appetite for TIPS


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Funds specialised in US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) saw USD700m in net redemptions in the week to 4 December, according to statistics released by Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research, which may suggest that investors have a reduced appetite for protection against inflation risks in the United States. These funds have seen their largest net outflows in 14 months, according to BofA Merrill Lynch, citing statistics from EPFR Global, which, however, were collected before the publication of United States employment statistics for the month of November, which revealed an acceleration in job creation and rising wages. Bond funds in all categories, however, underwent net outflows of USD3.2bn in the period, while funds specialised in investment grade bonds suffered a 50th consecutive week of net inflows, with USD4.3bn in subscriptions. Funds specialised in high yield bonds, however, underwent net outflows of USD1.4bn, the largest amount observed in seven weeks. Net flows in and out of equity funds were nearly balanced at -USD0.1bn. This figure, however, conceals USD4.5bn in net outflows from conventional funds, offset by USD4.3bn in inflows to ETFs.
