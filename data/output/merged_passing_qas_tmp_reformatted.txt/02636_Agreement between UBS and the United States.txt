Agreement between UBS and the United States


Les Echos reports that UBS, which has faced a series of legal actions over a tax evasion scandal, signed a definitive out-of-court settlement with the US authorities on Wednesday, 19 August. The agreement states that the names of 4,450 account-holders at UBS will be handed over to the US tax authorities. The agreement between Switzerland and the United States also provides for “further requests for administrative cooperation relating to approximately 4,450 accounts,” less than the 52,000 accounts initially claimed by the United States authorities, a press statement from the Swiss government points out.
