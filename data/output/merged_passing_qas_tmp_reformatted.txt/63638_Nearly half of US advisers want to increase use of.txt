Nearly half of US advisers want to increase use of ETFs


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The popularity of ETFs is continuing in North America. Investment advisers feel that the low-cost products provide more limited exposure to risk. As a result, 45% are planning to increase their use of ETFs, and 32% say they are planinng to increase their allocation to passive investment products, in order to better keep up with changes in the regulatory environment, according to the most recent monthly newsletter from Cerulli, «The Cerulli Edge - U.S. Monthly Products Trends Edition» (January 2017). Last year, ETFs attracted over USD500bn, to the detriment of actively-managed funds, which finished the year with net ouflows of USD310bn. Assets in ETFs, which rose 3.4% in November, and 3.5% in December, are up about 20% for the year overall, while assets in mutual funds are up only 6%. In France, the trend is not the same, as advisers mostly make commissions on sales of funds, but not ETFs.
