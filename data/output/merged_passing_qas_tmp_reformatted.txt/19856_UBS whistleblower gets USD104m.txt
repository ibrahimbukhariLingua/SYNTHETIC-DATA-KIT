UBS whistleblower gets USD104m


A former UBS banker, Bradley Birkenfeld, who helped the US government to launch an international crackdown against tax evasion, has received a reward of USD104m, the Wall Street Journal reports, adding hat this is the largest sum ever paid to a whistleblower. Birkenfeld began to cooperate with the US authorities in 2007, when he was still employed at the Swiss bank. He revealed the tax evasion tactics used by UBS and its high net worth clients. Birkenfeld was also tried and sentenced to a 40 month prison term.
