Derivatives: European Commission issues a statement and initiates consultation


The European Commission has issued a statement on the security of derivatives markets and simultaneously launched a consultation on the subject, which will conclude with a public hearing on 25 September. Depending on the results of the consultation, the Commission will draw operational conclusions, and will then propose appropriate measures, including legislation if necessary, by the end of the year to increase transparency and financial security. The statement, which points out the considerable diversity of OTC derivative markets, mentions some tools which may be used to maintain financial stability, including, among others, standardisation which may reduce operational risks, databases which increase transparency, and operational efficiency. On this last point, the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) has launched a feasibility study on the possibility of creating data center locations in the European Union. Another potential measure is compensation by central counterparties (CCPs). The industry has agreed to set up a central compensation service for CDS by 31 July. If CCPs do not honour their commitments, the Commission says that it will consider other measures to push for centralised compensation. The Commission has also published two working documents. The first of these analyses OTC derivatives markets, while the second is a consultation instrument which includes a detailed questionnaire to be returned by 31 July.
