LGT plans to sell off wealth management activities in Germany


A spokesperson for LGT Bank has confirmed to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that the collapse of its proposed acquisition of BHF-Bank from Deutsche Bank (see Newsmanagers of 19 April) will prevent it from achieving its strategic objectives for private banking in Germany. The firm will therefore sell off wealth management in the country (135 employees in seven locations), but will retain its institutional asset management activities there.
