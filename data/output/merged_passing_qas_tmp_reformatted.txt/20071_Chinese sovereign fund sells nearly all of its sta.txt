Chinese sovereign fund sells nearly all of its stake in BlackRock


China Investment Corp has sold most of its stake in BlackRock, as part of a strategy to reduce its exposure to financial institutions, the Financial Times reports. The Chinese sovereign fund bought the stake of nearly 3% of BlackRock, representing about USD1bn, when the firm acquired Barclays Global Investors in 2009. In the past few months, it has been gradually selling off these shares, for a profit, sources familiar with the matter say.
