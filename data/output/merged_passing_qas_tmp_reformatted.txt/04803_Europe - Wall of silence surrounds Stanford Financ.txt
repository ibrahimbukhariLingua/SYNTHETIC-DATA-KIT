Europe - Wall of silence surrounds Stanford Financial


As United States authorities have frozen the assets of Sir Allen Stanford, accused by the US Securities and Exchange Commission of a USD8bn fraud, clients worldwide are panicking and seeking to recuperate money deposited with the Stanford International Bank (SIB), based in the offshore tax haven of Antigua. In Venezuela, the banking regulatory authority is reported to have announced that one third, or USD2.5bn, of the amounts involved in the fraud belonged to Venezuelan clients, according to the Telegraph. And in Europe? The wealth management firm is clamping shut all lines of communication. When contacted by Newsmanagers, the European offices of Stanford Financial, based in Zurich, indicated that they were no longer responding directly to enquiries from the media, and that all questions should be addressed directly to the SEC. On the subject of the exposure of European and French clients,â€¯?we do not yet have precise information to disclose,? said Rose Romero, regional director of the SEC. Meanwhile, the investigation is continuing, apparently accelerated by the recent Madoff scandal. A manhunt has begun in the United States to find the billionaire, but for the moment, Stanford appears to be impossible to find.
