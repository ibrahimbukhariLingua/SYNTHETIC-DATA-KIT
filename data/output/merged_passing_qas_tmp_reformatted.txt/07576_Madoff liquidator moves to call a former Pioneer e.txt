Madoff liquidator moves to call a former Pioneer employee to testify


The lawyer Mark Hirshfield has submitted a request to a New York court to question a former employee of Pioneer (UniCredit group) as a witness in the Bernard Madoff case, Il Sole – 24 Ore reports, adding that the request was made on behalf of the court-appointed liquidator Irving Picard. The goal is ot understand the role which Pioneer and other third-party investors might have played in the case, Bloomberg reports. The management firm of the UniCredit group managed the assets of the Primeo and AllWeather funds, which in turn had invested in other funds managed by Bernard Madoff Investment Securities. Pioneer is thought to have invested about EUR800m overall in funds which replicated Madoff’s strategy.
