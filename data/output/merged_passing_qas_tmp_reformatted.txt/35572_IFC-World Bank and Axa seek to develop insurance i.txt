IFC-World Bank and Axa seek to develop insurance in emerging markets


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } The IFC-World Bank and Axa have signed a partnership to accelerate sales of insurance in emerging countries. The objective is to better protect populations in emerging markets and to favour their economic growth through better distribution of insurance. To this end, five priority cooperation objectives have been set, including joint investment in local insurance companies, particularly in Africa and Latin America, financing for infrastructure, and development of responsible insurance investment. In detail, “the technical and financial expertise in Axa and the long experience at IFC will be made common, initially especially in Africa, in order to imaging innovative solutions to promote infrastructure, essentially for economic growth. This will include the implementation of insurance and financing solutions,” a statement says. Meanwhile, Axa and IFC plan to undertake several initiatives, including active and responsible joint investments, which take into account environmental, social and governance factors; the development of micro-insurance via new product ranges and partnerships with micro-finance institutions, and studies to better understand the needs and risks associated with markets located at the bottom of the economic pyramid.”
