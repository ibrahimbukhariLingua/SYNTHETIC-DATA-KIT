Schroders recruits for institutional sales in Spain and Portugal


The UK asset management firm Schroders on Wednesday announced the recruitment of Mario Pires, ex-head of sales for Portugal at Deutsche Asset Management Spain, as a member of its Iberian team (Spain and Portugal), led by Carla Bergareche. He will be based in Madrid, and will cooperate closely with Pedro Assis, deputy managing director of Schroders for Spain and Portugal, to develop the institutional client base in the two countries. It is a newly-created position, by which Schroders hopes to strengthen this distribution channel.
