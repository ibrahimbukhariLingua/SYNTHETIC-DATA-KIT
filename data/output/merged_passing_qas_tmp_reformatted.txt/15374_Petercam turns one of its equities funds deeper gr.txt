Petercam turns one of its equities funds deeper green


Since the beginning of this year, Petercam has toughened the sustainable development approach of its European equities fund Petercam Equities Europe Sustainable, the former Petercam Equities Europe Ethical fund, in order to satisfy demand from numerous institutional investors and multi-managers.The Belgian-registered product (EUR79.5m) is distributed in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The management team, led by Lieven Op de Beeck, applies the selection process already used for bonds in the Petercam L Bonds Government Sustainable fund (see Newsmanagers of 8 July 2009) to equities. In other words, the fund is no longer based solely on the grid provided by Ethibel (Vigeo), but instead its managers use a more critical approach, reprocessing data from the sustainable development universe, within a time-frame of one month to liquidate the positions which are to be excluded. To achieve this, the Belgian management firm uses a matrix developed by Stijn Decock, who uses a best-in-class selection from rankings provided by Vigeo, with a detailed report for each share. Petercam also receives alerts in case of serious or controversial incidents.
