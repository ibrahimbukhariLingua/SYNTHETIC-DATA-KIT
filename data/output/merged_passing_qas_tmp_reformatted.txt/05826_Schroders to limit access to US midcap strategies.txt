Schroders to limit access to US midcap strategies


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Fund Strategy reports that Schroders is planning to limit access to its US midcap stratgies in the next 12 months. Assets under management in these strategies, the onshore Schroder US Mid Cap and offshore ISF US Small and Mid Cap Equity funds, total about USD4bn, and may rapidly increase to their optimal levels of about USD4.5bn, above which performance objectives may be more difficult to achieve. Therefore, a provisional closure of the two funds to new investments is expected in the near future. Investors interested in these funds will be redirected to another strategy, the ISF US All Cap Equity, launched in 2006, one third of whose assets are managed with the same approach as the midcap funds.
