Italian senator speaks out over powers amassed in the hands of Assogestioni chairman


The Italian senator Elio Lannutti has expressed surprise at the “deafening silence” which has prevailed over the appointment of Domenico Siniscalco, former Italian minister of the economy, and current president of Morgan Stanley, as chairman of Assogestioni, the Italian association of asset managers, the Italian news agency Asca reports. The politician claims that the variety of positions now held by Siniscalco imply “obvious conflicts of interest.” He points out that as chairman of Assogestioni, Siniscalco is able to appoint independent directors in publicly-traded companies, with which he would also work in his capacities at Morgan Stanley. Lannutti is critical of the silence of the Bank of Italy and the market regulatory agency on this subject.
