Union sets up its own system of country ratings


Frank Engels, CIO for fixed income, announced on 5 September that Union Investment (the central asset management firm for the German co-operative banks) has set up its own system of country ratings, because S&P, Moody’s and Fitch have demonstrated in the past few years that they continue to behave procyclically and to react too late.The system developed by Union allows for systematic, uniform and transparent judgement of the solvency of governments, on the basis of fundamental economic data and measurable social and political indicators. It is based on three basic elements: fundamental macroeconomic evaluation of the ability of governments to pay their debts, an estimate of the desire of these governments to pay, and thus to make the necessary reforms in the case of need, and lastly, an advanced warning system which detects signs of weakness in economies which had previously been solid.Compared with ratings by the established ratings agencies, the Union ratings are worse for many industrialised countries, due to weak growth, the scale of debt, and poor budgetary discipline. On the other hand, emerging countries with solid budgets and strong growth are better-rated than by the established ratings agencies.According to Engels, the country ratings system from Union has recently been able to anticipate about 80% of ratings adjustments by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch. The system will be integrated from 1 November into the basic allocation process for the UniInstitutional Global Government Bonds fund, which is focused on investment grade government bonds.
