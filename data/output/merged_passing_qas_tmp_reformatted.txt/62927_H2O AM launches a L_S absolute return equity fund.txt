H2O AM launches a L/S absolute return equity fund


H2O announced the launch of Fidelio, a long–short equity fund which aims to generate an absolute return of 5% p.a. over a recommended 3‐year investment horizon. The funds objective is to keep volatility below that of global equity markets within this timeframe. It will also seek to exhibit a low correlation to the major global equity market indices. To this end, the fund will take both long and short positions, mainly on economic sectors and listed companies. The fund benefits from the long‐standing global macro expertise of the H2O management team and relies on a “bottom‐up” process managed by Gonzague Legoff. Gonzague is the fund’s co-manager with Christophe Chappuis.
