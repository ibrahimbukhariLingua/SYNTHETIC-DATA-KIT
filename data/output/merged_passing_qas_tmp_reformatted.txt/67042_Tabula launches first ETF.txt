Tabula, a new bond ETF company founded by Michael John Lytle, has launched its first ETF, the Tabula European Performance Credit ETF, which will offer investors exposure to the corporate bond market in Europe, while seeking to eliminate the interest rate risks associated with traditional corporate bonds. The ETF, which tracks the iTraxx Europe Performance Cr√©dit index, is listed in London, and has an ongoing charge figure of 0.50%. The fund currently has EUR10m in assets. So far, the fund is registered for sale in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and a passport application for France is in progress. p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; }
