UBS manipulated the Hibor rate


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Brokers at UBS attempted to manipulate the Hibor interbank lending rate (Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate) between 2006 and 2009, according to a statement released on 14 March by the Hong Kong monetary authority (HKMA), after an investigation. Of nine banks, failures were found only at the top Swiss bank. Over 100 internal messages form several brokers at UBS mention requests to adapt the interest rates with the express objective of manipulating the Hibor. The surveillance authority did not, however, find evidence of collusion between banks, it says in its statement. The investigation found that UBS did not communicate to the authority that it had found fraudulent conduct on the part of its employees when it learned of it. This is “unacceptable,” HKMA says. The surveillance authority also found significant shortfalls in the internal control system at UBS and in governance as regards the process of setting the HIBOR rate.
