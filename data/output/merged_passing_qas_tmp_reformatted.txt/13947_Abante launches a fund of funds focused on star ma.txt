Abante launches a fund of funds focused on star managers


With the Smart-ISH fund (with the letters standing for Smart, and SpanISH), Abante Asesores on Monday unveiled a fund which will invest in up to 20 funds or Sicavs from the best Spanish managers, whose volume will be limited to EUR20m, Cinco Días reports. The objective will be to generate similar returns to those to be had from equities.Each position will represent between 4% and 8% of total assets, in funds half of which may not exceed EUR40m in assets. Management commission is 1.25%, and performance commission is 9%.Abante has already selected nearly 60 signature products, and is planning to select a total of 100 to create an investment universe. Among the star managers on the list (and whom Abante prefers to see invested personally in their funds) are Francisco Paramés (Bestinver), Gonzalo Lardiés (BPA Global Funds), Ricard Torrella (Gesinter), Alberto Espelosín (Ibercaja Gestión), Juan Antonio Bertrán (Cartesio), Ignacio Cantos (Atlas Capital) and Alfonso de Gregorio (Gesconsult). However, José Ramón Iturriaga, manager of the Okavango Delta fund, has not been chosen, since he manages for his own company, which could create conflicts of interest.
