ETFs: BaFin calls for European legislation


In an interview with the BÃ¶rsen-Zeitung, Thomas Neumann, head of fund supervision at BaFin, claims that ESMA has exhausted all the possibilities the UCITS IV and MiFID directives afford it for regulating ETFs. If regulations need to be changed in order to confront the dangers of synthetic replication and securities lending, the European legislator will need to take the relevant initiatives. Neumann says there is no product surveillance body for Europe which could regulate not only ETFs but also ETCs and ETNs, in order to ensure fair competition between funds and structured products.
