BlackRock softens its position on money market fund reforms


Mutual Fund Wire has reported on a BlackRock “ViewPoint” which issues proposals for money market reforms. The proposals seek a compromise with the Treasury and the SEC, particularly in accepting the notion of short-circuits, similar to the “gates” which Secretary fo the Treasury Tim Geithner has proposed to protect money market funds from massive capital outflows. Meanwhile, BlackRock has adopted a more conciliatory attitude to proposals by Mary Schapiro, chairwoman of the SEC, to introduce floating net asset value: a study is said to have shown that these proposals “would change but not destroy” the sector.
