Italian syndrome drags down European equities


“Buy-the-dip,” the saying goes. The least that can be said is that investors were in no rush to buy European stocks in the dip. Flows were moderate in the last week of May, with the notable exception of European equity funds, which, in line with previous weeks, have seen net outflows of USD4.5bn in the week to 30 May, according to a weekly study by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, based on data from the global flow evolution monitoring specialist EPFR Global. Political movements in Italy have continued to perturb the markets, and investors remain very concerned about a potential agreement to govern between the anti-establishment 5 Star movement (M5S) and a league of far right parties. This agreement had not yet been reached by mid-week, and was provoking fears of a potential new election in Italy.In the past three months, European equity funds have seen net outflows of USD29bn. However, invetors are turning to US equities, suggesting that a movement from European equities to US equities is underway, analysts at BofA Merrill Lynch estimate. In the past three weeks, US equity funds have attracted USD23bn, with nearly USD6bn in the week to 30 May. Emerging market equity funds have posted net outflows of USD2bn, the largest since December 2016. In all geographical regions combined, equity funds saw inflows of only USD3bn.In bonds, the week brought net outflows of USD1.1bn. Investment graed bond funds have posted net outflows of USD1.5bn. Divestment (USD0.4bn) was more limited from emerging market bond funds, which investors avoided for the sixth consecutive week.
