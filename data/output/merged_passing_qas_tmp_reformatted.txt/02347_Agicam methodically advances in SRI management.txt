Agicam methodically advances in SRI management


Of roughly EUR12bn in assets which it manages for the AG2R La Mondiale group and financial supports for employee savings, Agicam has about EUR600m in SRI assets, or 5% of the total, while the average is 1% for institutionals. This also, says Philippe Dutertre, chairman of the board at Agicam, represents about 4% of institutional assets in socially responsible from all French institutionals. The management firm is constructing an SRI team consisting of five managers/financial analysts and three senior SRI analysts to be part of a single board. Its services have also developed EthisScreeninG, an exclusive tool which provides analysis of risks and positive points in ESG management, and is constructing a database of businesses and sectors of activity. The SRI unit of Agicam posted approximately EUR100m in net subscriptions in 2008, and the firm is planning for EUR150m in 2009 and EUR250m next year. For the beginning of December, the management firm is planning to launch a fund of SRI mandates, with allocations to aggregate, government bonds and credit, in partnership with Mercer. Agicam is also planning an SRI fund of funds, in partnership with Altedia.
