Spain - Santander avoided closure of Banif Inmobiliario in November


It is now apparent that there were troubles at the Bantander Banif Inmobiliario fund as early as November 2008. Expansi√≥n reports that Santander has admitted that at that time, it injected EUR160m, or 3.42% of assets in the fund, to avoid freezing the fund after it received redemption demands totalling EUR500m at the end of its last redemption window in 2008. The bank covered all the redemption demands it could with available cash, totalling about EUR400m, and invested its own equity in the fund to make up the difference and keep up with redemption demands. It has since submitted its own redemption demand, and will recuperate its own money at the same time as other subscribers. Santander also announced on Wednesday that it is planning to take onto its own books some of the shares which will be redeemed to clients on 9 May.
