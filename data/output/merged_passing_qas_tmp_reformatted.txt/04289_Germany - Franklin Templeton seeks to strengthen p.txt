In an interview with the BÃ¶rsen-Zeitung, Reinhard Berben, CEO for Germany, admits that Franklin Templeton Investment Services, better known for its equities management, has some catching up to do in the German market in bonds and institutional clients. Franklin Templeton is planning to better diversify and is planning to achieve the same market share in the institutional segment as it has in retail.
