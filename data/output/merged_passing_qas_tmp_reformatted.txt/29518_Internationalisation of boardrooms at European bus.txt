Internationalisation of boardrooms at European businesses remains limited


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Only 5.6% of board members at the 50 largest European businesses in terms of market capitalisation come from emerging countries, while more than half of these firms earn at least 20% of their revenues in these markets, a new research by Axa Investment Managers reveals. Boards of directors and management at businesses remain highly European, or highly national. 84 per cent of board directors and 76 per cent of senior executives are European nationals. 66 per cent of boards are dominated (more than 50 per cent) by a single nationality. Three firms stand out with a board comprised of only one nationality. They are the Spanish bank BBVA, which earns 50% of its revenues in Latin America, far more than its domestic market (30%), the Swedish clothing store H&M, whose largest market is Europe (32%), while the second-largest is the United States (21%), and the Italian oil firm Eni, which earns 30% of its revenues in Europe and 30% in Italy. Analysis of the proportion of women across the EuroStoxx 50 reveals an hourglass effect: gender balance is high at the bottom of organisations (35 per cent of the workforce are women), decreasing when going up the hierarchy towards senior management (11 per cent of executive committees are female), but increasing again at board level (18 per cent women). Thirteen of the 50 companies have no female senior executive and none have a female CEO at the time of writing. This lack of female senior managers today may create a bottleneck for companies looking to attract women board directors in the future.
