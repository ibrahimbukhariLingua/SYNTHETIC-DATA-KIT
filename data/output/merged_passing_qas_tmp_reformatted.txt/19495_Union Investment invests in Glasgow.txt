Union Investment invests in Glasgow


The German firm Union Investment has announced that it has acquired the G1 office building (12,200 square metres) in Glasgow for an undisclosed amount for the open-ended real estate fund UniImmo: Deutschland. Overall, open-ended real estate funds from Union Investment own five properties (hotels and offices) in Cardiff, Glasgow, Manchester and Stansted, representing an investment of EUR310m. The proportion of “regional cities” in the British portfolio (EUR1.1bn) is thus about 30%.
