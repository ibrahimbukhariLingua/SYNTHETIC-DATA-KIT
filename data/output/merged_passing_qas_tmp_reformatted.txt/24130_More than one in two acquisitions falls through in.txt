More than one in two acquisitions falls through in emerging markets


More than 50% of acquisitions planned in emerging markets founder on due diligence issues, according to a PwC study of mergers and acquisitions in emerging markets (“Make your acquisitions succeed in emerging countries.”) For successful acquisitions, the impact in terms of value created or destroyed is far higher than that observed on mature markets. On the basis of our sample, the most unfavourable acquisitions resulted in losses for the investors of an average of half the initially invested capital.In an analysis of over 200 transactions, PwC has identified seven areas of difficulty in the processing of transactoins in high-growth countries: lack of transparency in terms of financial information, difficulty in justifying high levels of valuation, risk associated with con-compliant commercial practices, post-acquisition integration difficulties, the emergence of conflicts between partners, and the intervention of public bodies.To confront these difficulties, PwC proposes several measures to manage risks and increase the odds of success in emerging countries. Among the measures PwC quotes are identifying a strategic rationale, upstream transactions, on-site visits and the establishment of best practices in terms of conduct in transactions, which should be adapted to the specificities of local markets, in order to confront high market risks.
