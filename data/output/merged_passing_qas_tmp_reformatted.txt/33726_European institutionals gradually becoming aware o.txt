European institutionals gradually becoming aware of carbon risks


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Nearly one third of European institutional investors feel that they are exposed to carbon risk, according to Novethic, which has surveyed 185 long-term investors in 13 European countries, at the helm of more than EUR6trn in assets. But one year ahead of the United Nations climate change conference, only 12% measure the carbon footprint of their portfolios, assessing the volume of greenhouse has that they indirectly contribute to emitting, and only 10% have deployed a low-carbon investment strategy. Also, only 31 investors out of 185 surveyed have signed the Global Investor Statement on Climate Change, published as part of the United Nations Climate summit in New York in Septembre 2014, and 67% said that they have taken no concrete action in this area. Signatories to the declaration recognize that greenhouse gas emissions will have an impact on their investments, and commit to directing financing towards an economy with lower greenhouse emissions. Several approaches exist to manage carbon risks. Novethic ranks invetors who recognize carbon risks into two categories: those who want to manage it and choose to lower carbon emissions from their portfolios, and those who seek to minimise it by divesting from the most carbon-intensive sectors, starting with coal and oil.
