Aberdeen leads list of underperforming funds from Tilney Bestinvest


Aberdeen is getting some bad publicity. Nine funds from the group figure on a list by Tilney Bestinvest of the worst performing funds (“Spot the Dog.”) The wealth management firm publishes the rankings twice a year, of OEICs and collective investment organisms which have underperformed for the past three years consecutively, and by more than 10% over a three-year period.The most recent list includes 60 funds, compared with 49 in July last year. The number of Aberdeen funds included in the list has risen from one last July to nine, partly due to the acquisition of SWIP, many of whose funds placed in the rankings last year.The contributions by Aberdeen include three international funds, two British funds, one European and one North American fund, as well as two funds from Scottish Widows and Halifax. This is the first time that a firm has had so many funds in the rankings in the past 10 years.According to Jason Hollands, managing director of Tilney Bestinvest, the Aberdeen UK Opportunities, Halifax Special Situations and Scottish Widows UK Select Growth funds are recent acquisitions whose performance is likely to improve under the aegis of Aberdeen.After Aberdeen, whose nine funds represent a cumulative volume of GBP1.58bn, comes Neptune, with five funds, and a cumulative GBP555m, M&G, with two funds totalling GBP7.94bn, and BNY Me.lon, with two funds totalling GBP4.86bn.
