Axa Asia plans to diversify in alternative management


Asian Investor reports that Axa Asia is hoping to increase its alternative investments to 7% to 8% of Asian assets under management, to the detriment of allocation to equities in the region. Currently, the French group dedicates about 1% of its assets from the general life insurance account (USD12bn in assets) to hedge funds, infrastructure, private equity and real estate. The current allocation, which stands at about USD120m, may increase to USD800m, distributed between real estate (4%), private equity/infrastructure (2%) and hedge funds (1%). The objective is to reach this new distribution within two years, says Arnaud Mounier, chief investment officer at Axa Asia.
