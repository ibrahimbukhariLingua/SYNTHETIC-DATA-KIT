Lyxor AM and SGPB consider additional synergies


As part of an operation to reorganise the entire Société Générale group, the French bank is currently considering ways to strengthen synergies between its private management expertise areas, particularly between teams at Société Générale Private Banking (SGPB) and Lyxor AM. These considerations were announced internally a few days ago, and may take concrete form in the coming weeks.“We want a more horizontal organisation, oriented to clients with a stronger regional emphasis,” Société Générale stated as part of its reorganization plan in April 2017. This plan had been based largely on the creation of 17 busienss units and 10 service units, which report directly to the general management. It is within one of these business units, the Asset and Wealth Management business unit. That SGPB and Lyxor Am teams have united under the leadership of Jean-François Mazaud, who was appointed at that time as chairman of the supervisory board at Lyxor AM, in addition to his role as direcor of SGPB.For now, Société Générale is considering ways to pool expertise between the various management teams, to strengthen offerings in private management in particular. “We are in the process of looking at possible synergies in management within the asset and wealth management business unit,” a spokesperson for Lyxor AM says. “We want to pool our management expertise within open architecture which is common to the two entities.” The group currently has the SG29 Haussmann asset management firm as a part of SGPB, specialised in private management and open architecture.When asked about the precise form that the pooling might take, the spokesperson did not wish to discuss details for now.
