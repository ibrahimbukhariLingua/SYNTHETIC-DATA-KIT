Government Pension Fund - Global liquidates its shares in Norilsk


On the recommendation of the Council on Ethics of the Government Pension Fund - Global, the Norwegian finance ministry has decided to remove Norilsk Nickel from the portfolio of the pension fund, and in the two months to the end of October has sold off its shares, representing a value of EUR37m. The Russian group is the 31st company to be excluded from the pension fund on ethical grounds. The Ethical Council found that Norilsk’s pollution of the Taymyr peninsula in Siberia was extremely severe, particularly in the form of SO2, nickel and heavy metals, which endanger 200,000 residents near production sites. The Council has not yet evaluated Norilsk’s installations on the Kola peninsula.
