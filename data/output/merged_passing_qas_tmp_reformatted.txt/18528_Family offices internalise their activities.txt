Family offices internalise their activities


A growing number of family offices are scaling up their resources in order to be able to offer their key activities internally, according to a study by the Wharton Global Family Alliance (WFGA), which is publishing some of its conclusions, while reserving its full results for family offices. Activities related to investment are particularly affected by this trend, as well as activities related to fund administration. In the wake of the financial crisis, family offices have considerably developed their expertise in the area of risk management. This desire to better control risks has resulted in a diversification of portfolios and the introduction of a larger range of risk measurement tools, including less conventional tools at the largest family offices. The WGFA reports that family offices increased their investments in art and precious metals fivefold between 2009 and 2011, which brings their allocation in portfolios to 5%, Handelsblatt also reports. Meanwhile, private equity investors have fallen from 11% in 2009 to 9% in 2011. Allocation to hedge funds has held stable at 12%, but the proportion of funds of funds has fallen to a near-zero leel. This disaffection with funds of funds is due to potential conflicts of interest at the largest providers, and last but not least, on mediocre returns in the past few years. In the past four years to the end of 2011, funds of funds lost an average of 3% per year, according to Bloomberg statistics.
