Alfi March Events: Alfi to open an office in Hong Kong soon


The Luxembourg association of investment funds Alfi will open a branch office in Hong Kong, Claude Kremer, president of Alfi and vice-president of Efama, announced on Tuesday at the Alfi Days event. The decision is a sign of the importance of the Asian market for the Luxembourg fund industry, which is based on the growth of UCITS as a brand. Asia-Pacific is already using European coordinated UCITS funds. In the first three quarters of 2009, more than 14% of gross subscriptions to UCITS funds came from the Asian region, according to Lipper FMI. The person who will be recruited for the Hong Kong office will meet with all participants in the asset management sector in Asia: investors, regulators, management firms, and others. The job will also involve travelling throughout Asia, particularly in China, an immense market which Alfi is eyeing. The opening of the office does not necessarily mean that Alfi is not interested in other international markets. Currently, Latin America and Asia represent 40% of total net sales of UCITS, and their growth is more rapid there than in Europe.
