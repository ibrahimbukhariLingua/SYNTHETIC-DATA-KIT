BNP Paribas sells former Fortis Private Investment Management


Evolution Group, the listed investment bank and private client investment management group, has announced that its wholly owned private client investment management subsidiary, Williams de Broë Limited , has reached agreement with BNP Paribas Wealth Management S.A. for the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of the former Fortis Private Investment Management business, now BNP Paribas Private Investment Management Limited . Completion of the Acquisition is conditional only on the Financial Services Authority granting its consent to the change of control of PIM. An application for such consent has been submitted and it is expected that such consent will be granted and the acquisition will be completed prior to the end of the current financial year. The acquisition of PIM, which comprises a UK private client investment management business under the stewardship of a team located in London with a small Global Derivatives Department and US Brokerage, is ultimately expected to result in approximately GBP1.8bn assets under management transferring to Williams de Broë.
