London commercial real estate market recovering


The fact that Union Investment Real Estate (UIRE) has recently purchased a top-quality office building at 10 Gresham Street in London for GBP141.5m suggests that the London real estate market has begun to recover. The eight-story, 260,000 square foot property was developed by Standard Life Investments. It was completed in 2003, and its tenants include Lloyds Banking group, the private equity investor JC Flowers & Co, and the consultant Jones Lang LaSalle.
