Equity funds favour high dividend stocks


In the third week of August, weak economic outlooks dominated investorsâ€™ strategies. Most categories of funds saw redemptions. According to EPFR Global, the week to 17 August ended with outflows from high yield bond funds and commodity funds of over USD2bn. However, investors are increasingly hungry for high dividend equities. Since the beginning of the year, equity funds which focus on high-dividend shares had inflows of nearly USD13bn, while equity funds overall saw outflows of over USD45bn. Bond funds finished the week under review with net outflows of USD4.1bn, while equity funds, for their part, saw outflows of USD5.81bn, which is, however, less than one quarter of the total observed the previous week. Money market funds, which had recently attracted record inflows, posted net outflows of only USD1.93bn. Outflows from equities funds slowed, to USD2.77bn, half of which went to Asia ex Japan equity funds, as investors were doubtful that a high level of exports from the region would be maintained. In Europe, in a market environment devastated by the recent turbulence, German equity funds nonetheless remained in positive territory with inflows of over USD1bn.
