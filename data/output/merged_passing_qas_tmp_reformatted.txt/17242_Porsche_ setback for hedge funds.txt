Porsche: setback for hedge funds


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Agefi reports that a New York state judge, Harold Baer, on Thursday rejected lawsuits filed by hedge funds related to the financial disclosures made by Porsche in 2008. The judge thus strengthened hopes that the merger of Porsche and Volkswagen would go ahead as planned in late 2011. The 40 hedge funds, led by Elliott Associates and Black Diamond, which lost USD2bn in the takeover bid by the largest European auto maker for its specialist compatriot, may now be defeated, the newspaper notes. Porsche did not disclose its real intentions to the hedge funds, which had short-sold shares, provoking a “short squeeze” effect when the funds were required to buy back the shares in catastrophic conditions.
