BlackRock adds to bond ETF range


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } BlackRock on 29 June announced the launch of a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) which offers investors exposure to ‘fallen angels.’ The ETF includes bonds which have recently suffered a downgrade to their credit rating, taking them from the investment grade into the high yield category, which might be expected to interest investors seeking to benefit from anomalies in valuation which may result from this downgrade, the asset management firm states. The fund, entitled iShares Fallen Angels High Yield Corporate Bond UCITS ETF (WING), provides exposure to global high yield bonds which were previously classed as investment grade. The underlying index of the fund is exposed to over 450 positions, with the exposure of each issuer limited to 3% of the value of the total market “in the interests of diversificaftion,” according to BlackRock. The underlying index is rebalanced every month. Issuers and bonds from emerging markets with a rating lower than B- are excluded during this selection process. The iShares Fallen Angels High Yield Corporate Bond UCITS ETF fund is a physical replication ETF, “which means that it acquires the securities of the index,” says BlackRock. The total expense ratio is 0.50%.
