Levy will be based in New York, and will work in close collaboration with Holger Schmiedling, economist in chief at Berenberg. Levy joins Berenberg from Blenheim Capital Management, where he spent two years as chief economist. He was previously chief economist at Bank of America for 15 years. His arrival allows Berenberg to strengthen its presence in the US market, and to continue the development of its activities, after opening offices in New York, Boston, Chicago and San Franciaco in the past four years. Berenberg emphasizes in a statement that Levy advises several US federal reserve banks, and has very close relationships with the European Commission and the Bank of Japan. He also belongs to the Congressional Budget Offices Panel of Economist Advisors and since 1983 has been a member of the Shadow Open Market Committee, an independent research body which reviews the monetary policy of the Fed.
