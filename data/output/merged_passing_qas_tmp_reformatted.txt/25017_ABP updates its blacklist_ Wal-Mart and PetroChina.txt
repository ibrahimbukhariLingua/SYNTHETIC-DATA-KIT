ABP updates its blacklist: Wal-Mart and PetroChina are “out”


Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP (ABP, EUR239bn in assets), the pension fund for public employees and teachers in the Netherlands, on 1 January updated its blacklist of companies and countries in which it is not permitted to invest due to the fund’s signature of the United Nations Global Compact. The blacklist now includes 17 companies and 10 government bonds. There are now no longer any French businesses on the list, as Zodiac Aerospace has been removed due to discontinuing its participation in the production of cluster bombs (as have General Dynamics, L-3 Communications, Magellan Aerospace and Valentec Systems).Four new names have been added to the list, two of which are emblematic. For instance, ABP will now not invest in the US retail chain Wal-Mart, which is not comfortably in line with the directives of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) on employee rights.The Dutch pension fund also refuses to invest in PetroChina, due to the implication of its parent company, CNPC, in Sudan and Burma.The other two additions to the list are the South Korean firm Poongsan Holdings Corp and the Israeli firm Ashdot Ashkelon, which are both involved in the production of “controversial” weapons.Government bonds barred from the portfolio of ABP are all due to weapon embargoes declared by the United Nations security council.
