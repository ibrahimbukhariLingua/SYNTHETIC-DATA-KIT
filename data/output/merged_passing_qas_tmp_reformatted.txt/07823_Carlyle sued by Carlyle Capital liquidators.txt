Carlyle sued by Carlyle Capital liquidators


Alan Roberts and Neil Mather, the liquidators of the hedge fund management firm Carlyle Capital Corp (CCC), which went bankrupt in March 2008 due to unfortunate investments in the mortgage-backed bond markets, is suing the private equity investor Carlyle Group as well as the former directors of CCC in Guernsey, New York, Washington and Delaware, for breaches of fiduciary duty, recklessness and negligence. The Wall Street Journal reports that the liquidators are hoping to make back more than USD1bn against capital losses at CCC. Carlyle Group claims that the suit is unfounded. CCC was founded in 2006 and was launched on the stock markets with USD880m provided by clients. To optimise its gains, CCC borrowed USD22bn. The firm went bankrupt in March 2008, with a default on USD16.6bn in debt.
