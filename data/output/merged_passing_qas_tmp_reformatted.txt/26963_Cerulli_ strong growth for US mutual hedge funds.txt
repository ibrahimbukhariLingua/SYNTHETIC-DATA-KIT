Cerulli: strong growth for US mutual hedge funds


Asset managers expect alternative mutual fund assets to comprise close to 14% from 2% currently of all mutual fund assets in the next 10 years, according to new research from Cerulli Associates.Since the financial crisis in 2008, institutions and advisors have been under pressure to increase returns while keeping risk unchanged. «As a result, alternative products are attracting interest from retail and institutional investors, as both are increasingly looking for portfolio diversification, enhanced returns, and risk management,» states Michele Giuditta, associate director at Cerulli.Some 25% of advisors plan to increase their allocations to alternative mutual funds, with 5% indicating they plan to increase their allocations by more than 10%,
