Mutual funds outperform the S&amp;P 500


In 2008, US equities funds lost an average of 38.9%, while the S&P 500 fell by 37%. Six of the largest ten actively-managed funds lost more than the S&P 500, The Wall Street Journal reports. YTD the average US equities fund as of 10 June shows performance of 9.9%, compared with 5.3% for the index, and eight of the ten largest funds are also outperforming the index. The Growth Fund of America from American Funds (USD131bn) is up 15%, and the Magellan fund from Fidelity has gained 19.7%.These results donâ€™t mean fund managers have become more savvy; it is merely due to a preference for growth shares, which have gained nearly 11% since the beginning of the year, compared with 1% for value shares.The Journal points out that these good results have not immunised funds against redemptions: all of the ten largest actively-managed equities funds have seen net redemptions, according to Lipper.
