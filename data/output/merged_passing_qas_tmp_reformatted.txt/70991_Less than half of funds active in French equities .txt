Less than half of funds active in French equities outperfomed the index in 2017


Over the year 2017 as a whole, fewer than half (47%) of French actively-managed equity funds denominated in euros outperformed the S&P France BMI index, according to a comparative study of S&P indices against active funds from (SPIVA) Europe. The percentage is even lower over longer periods: over five and ten years, 30% and 18% of funds, respectively, outperform the index.Equity funds investing in French equities earned average returns weighted by assets 0.6 percentage points lower than the S&P France BMI index over one year, and one point lower per year over ten years. The average weighted return per asset indicates the performance for an average investor, and attenuates the influence of smaller funds, a statement says.For European equity funds, the findings are similar, to within a few percentage points. 53% of European actively-managed equity funds denominated in euros outperformed the S&P Europe 350 index. But the percentage alls to 27% and 15% for five- and ten-year time spans.However, only 29% of US actively-managed equity funds domiciled in Europe and denominated in euros outperformed the S&P 500 index over the one-year period. Over the longer term, it gets worse: 4% and 2% of funds do better than the index over five and ten years.For global equity funds based in Europe, 46% of actively-managed funds denominated in euros outperformed the S&P Global 1200 over the one-year period, which is in line with French equity funds. But this figure falls steeply over a three, five, or ten-year period, with 9%, 6%, and 1%, respectively.For emerging market funds, 28% of actively-managed emerging market equity funds denominated in euros outperformed the S&P/IFCI index. This figure falls to 3% over ten years.
