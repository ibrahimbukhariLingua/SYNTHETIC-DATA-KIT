SSgA launches the first European ETF exposed to short-term emerging market bonds


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) on 14 November announced the launch on Xetra, Deutsche Börse of the SPDR® BofA Merrill Lynch 0–5 Year EM USD Government Bond UCITS ETF fund, the first European ETF to be exposed to short-term bonds from emerging markets in US dollars. The new ETF, which charges 0.42%, and which tracks the BofA Merrill Lynch 0–5 Year EM USD Government Bond ex-144a Index, aims to replicate the performance of short-term bonds issued in US dollars by governments in emerging countries. That allows investors seeking to reduce the duration or volatility of their existing investments in emerging market debt in US dollars to access a new market segment. Investors may also increase the returns on their existing short-term investments, denominated in US dollars.
