Quilter to offer prudent euro strategy


The Dublin-based asset management firm Quilter has added a prudent euro strategy to its Managed Portfolio Service (MPS) aimed at financial advisers whose clients have a limited appetite for risk, Investment Europe reports. The strategy comes as a complement to the euro range from Quilter, which now includes the three approaches “prudent, diversified, and growth.” Quilter also offers eight strategies denominated in pounds sterling, managed in London. The new prudent strategy includes 32.5% equities, 57.5% bonds/cash, 7.5% hedge and alternative strategies, and 2.5% real estate.
