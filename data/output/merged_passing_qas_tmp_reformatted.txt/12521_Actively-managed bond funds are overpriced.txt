Actively-managed bond funds are overpriced


According to a study by Vanguard based on statistics from Morningstar covering the past 20 years, two thirds of actively-managed bond funds in the United States have underperformed the bond markets, the Wall Street Journal reports. 20 years ago, according to the Investment Company Institute, a bond fund cost an average of USD100 for every USD10,000 invested, and that amount would have generated an average annual revenue of USD825, if it were invested in 10-year US Treasury bonds, and USD1,050 if it were invested in corporate bonds rated Baa by Moodyâ€™s. In 2010, the average commission charged by bond funds was USD70 for every USD10,000 invested. But the same amount invested in 10-year US Treasury bonds or Baa-rated corporate bonds would now generate only USD330 and USD540 in annual revenue, respectively. However, the Wall Street Journal observes, investors can find better deals by subscribing to bond ETFs. Investors who subscribe to products such as the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF, the iShares Barlays Aggregate Bond Fund or the SPDR Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond ETF will pay only USD11 to USD22 per year for every USD10,000 invested.
