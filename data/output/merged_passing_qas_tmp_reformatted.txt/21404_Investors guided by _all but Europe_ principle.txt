Investors guided by “all but Europe” principle


In the second week of June, investors avoided European funds due to uncertainties surrounding the euro zone (elections in Greece, a downgrade in the Spanish sovereign debt rating). European bond funds have seen redemptions at a level never before observed since the end of December 2011, and European equity funds have seden their sixth week of outflows in the past twelve weeks, according to estimates from EPFR Global.Equity funds overall have seen net inflows of USD10.91bn in the week to 13 June, a level not seen for over a year, but three quarters of these inflows were for US equity funds.Bond funds in the week under review attracted USD1.46bn, but European bond funds saw redemptions totalling over USD1bn. Once again, US funds were favoured by investors, with inflows of over USD2bn.Money market funds, for their part, finished the week ending on 13 June with redemptions totalling USD11bn, as outflows from US money market funds more than offset subscriptions to European money market funds.
