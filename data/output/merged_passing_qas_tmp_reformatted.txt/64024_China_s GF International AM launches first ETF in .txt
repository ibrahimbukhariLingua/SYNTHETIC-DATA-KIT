China’s GF International AM launches first ETF in London


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } GF International Asset Management, an affiliate of the Chinese asset management firm GF Fund Management, has listed its first ETF on the London Stock Exchange, the London stock market operator announced on 12 January. The GF International-FTSE China A Ucits fund is the first ETF to track the FTSE China A index, which is part of the FTSE Global China A Inclusion Index Series. “This is also the first ETF launched by a Chinese asset management firm based in Europe,” the London Stock Exchange says in a statement. The new ETF is denominated in US dollars. The market company points out that the FTSE Global China A Inclusion index series was designed to offer a choice to investors in the way they include Chinese A shares into international benchmarks. The FTSE Global China A Inclusion indices, launched in May 2015 by FTSE Russell, represent a transitional resource for investors ahead of eventual inclusion of Chinese A shares into international benchmarks. The FTSE China A index, for its part, is composed of large and mid-cap issuers of Chinese A shares. GF Fund Management becomes the eighth Chinese asset management firm to list an ETF on the London stock exchange, “reaffirming the position of the London Stock Exchange as the partner of choice for Chinese issuers seeking access to international and European capital,” the British stock market operator says.
