Ecofi Investissements reinforces voting policies


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } As the season of general shareholders’ meetings has begun, Ecofi Investissements has announced that it has “reinforced” its voting policy. In pay policy, the asset management firm will prefer companies which publish sufficiently detailed financial and extra-financial indicators on which variable pay is based. It is also asking for these remuneration policies to include social and environmental performance indicators. It takes a favourable view of remuneration policies which publish the pay ratio, between the highest and the median salary. Lastly, it requires that firms not increase salaries for appointed members of personnel in the case of significant layoff plans (solidarity principle). Concerning the dividend policy, Ecofi Investissements will oppose resolutions in which the dividends proposed are excessive with respect to the results achieved. “An unbalanced dividend policy (average of payout ratios over the past five years higher than 80%) can indicate a management philosophy which is too focused on the short term,” a statement explains. Lastly, Ecofi Investissements will oppose renewing the term for directors at companies who have been involved in severe controversy in the past term, except in case of public opposition from the director concerned.
