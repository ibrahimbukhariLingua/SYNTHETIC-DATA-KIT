Jupiter’s presence in France growing


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } About one year ago, the British asset management firm Jupiter entered the French market, with a partnership with the third party marketing firm Alfi Partners. One year later, Eric Bonneville, founding partner, says that “hundreds of millions of euros” have been raised for the London management firm from professional investors. This was no easy task in a market which is highly cautious of equities, Jupiter’s privileged asset class. “We largely benefited from arbitrages, particularly in multi-management,” explains Bonneville, adding that European equities were the most popular destination for investments, particularly the European Growth fund, managed by Alexander FC Darwall, which gained 26.84% in 2010. The New Europe fund, focused on central and eastern Europe, and the Global Convertible fund of global convertible equities were also popular with investors, Bonneville says. The products are part of the Luxembourg Sicav founded in 2001 in order to allow Jupiter to develop in continental Europe. The Sicav saw an increase in its assets from EUR700m to EUR1.3bn last year, while total assets have risen from EUR23bn at the end of 2009 to EUR28.4bn as of 31 December 2010. In 2011, Alfi Partners is hoping that investors will move a little more towards equities, which would work to Jupiter’s advantage. The TPM provider also works with the US independent management firm Brown Advisory, and is hoping to sign new partnerships in the near future in order to extend the range of funds it makes available.
