Citigroup limits talks to three potential buyers for Nikko AM


Citigroup has restricted negotiations for a sale of its Japanese asset management affiliate, Nikko Asset Management, to three potential buyers, the Wall Street Journal reports. The firm is the third-largest Japanese asset management firm, and its sale is expected to bring in more than USD1bn for the bank. The contenders still in the running are T&D Holdings, Sumotomo Trust & Banking and Bank of New York Mellon, and sources familiar with the matter say that bids are already higher than the vendor had initially expected.
