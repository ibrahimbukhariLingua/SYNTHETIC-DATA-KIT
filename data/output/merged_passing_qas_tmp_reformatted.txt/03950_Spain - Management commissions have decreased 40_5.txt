Spain - Management commissions have decreased 40.5% in 14 years


The Inverco association of management firms on Friday published its annual study of management commission levels, including administration and distribution fees. The study shows that as of the end of December, the average level of fees was 0.97%, which represents a 6.7% decrease from a level of 1.04% twelve months earlier. The decline has been constant over the past 14 years. At the end of 1994, average commissions were 1.63%, and the decrease since that time represents 40.5%.The least expensive products as of the the end of 2008 were short-term bonds (0.62%), which represent 25.7% of total assets, and money market funds (0.72%), which account for 20.3%.Management commissions are legally limited to 2.25%, and Inverco points our that the average charge for funds comes in at 43% of this amount. Subscription and redemption commissions, for their part, represent about 0.01% by weighted average, though the theoretical legal limit is 5% for each type of fee.
