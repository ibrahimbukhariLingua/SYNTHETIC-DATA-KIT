Guotai launches a QDII tracker fund based on Nasdaq 100


Guotai Fund Management has announced that it will be launching its QDII fund on 22 March. It will be the first QDII tracker fund, and will replicate the Nasdaq 100 index. The QDII portion of the product will total USD700m, or CNY4.8bn. A-Ben Advisors reports that the fee structure is “aggressive,” with a management commission of only 0.80%, the lowest level for any existing QDII fund. Several other passively-managed QDII funds are in the pipeline: an ETF from China AMC focused on Hong Kong, an S&P 500 ETF from China Southern Fund Management, and a Topix 30 ETF from Fortune SGAM. A-Ben Advisors also reports that Fortis Haitong is planning to launch a product which will invest in both A and H share classes.
