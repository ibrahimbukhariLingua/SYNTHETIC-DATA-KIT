BBVA and Lyxor to launch new ETFs


In order to maintain their lead on the Spanish ETF market as new foreign competitors arrive, BBVA and Lyxor Asset Management (Société Générale) will launch new products this year. Now that ETFs in Sicav vehicles will be allowed, iShares from BlackRock and db x-trackers from Deutsche Bank will become available in Spain. Lyxor is planning to launch 10 to 15 new products in first quarter, says Adrián Juliá, director of index products at Société Générale in Spain. Among the new ETFs, Lyxor is planning to release commodities products, “short” funds and, if the BME grants a license, a fund replicating one of the indices of the Ibex range. BBVA, for its part, is planning to extend its range largely with bond, commodity, and short ETFs. It is also planning to list its ETFs in other Latin American countries, following its entry into the Mexican market.
