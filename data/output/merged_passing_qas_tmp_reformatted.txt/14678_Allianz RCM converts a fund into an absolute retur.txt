Allianz RCM converts a fund into an absolute return product


Subscribers to the Allianz RCM UK Growth fund (Allianz Global Investors) have been advised that they will be invited to an extraordinary general shareholdersâ€™ meeting to authorise the transfer of GBP58m in assets to the new Allianz RCM UK Absolute Return fund, which will result in the conversion of the original fund into an absolute return product. The manager will be Jeremy Thomas, CIO for UK equities at RCM, with the objective of earning higher returns than those from money markets and bonds, with lower volatility than equities, and to outperform the FTSE All Share index over the long term. The fund will be constructed around a strategic long-only portfolio and a tactical long/short market neutral portfolio.
