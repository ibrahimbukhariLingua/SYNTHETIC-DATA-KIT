Leaders in asset management industry strengthen their positions


Leaders in the asset management industry in terms of profits are going to enlarge the gap with their rivals, a new McKinsey study of the asset management industry funds.In 2013 and beyond, the top 25 percent (top quartile) of players in terms of profitability will capture up to 70% of a potentially contracting profit pool, expected to fall to a total level of EUR7.2bn to EUR11.2bn.In 2011, players in the top quartile had already increased their share of total profits in the sector, which contracted to EUR9.6bn, to 58%, compared with only 25% in 2007, though at the time, profits represented a total of EUR13.7bn.Players in the second and third quartiles will share an increasingly slender slice of a shrinking cake: 10% in 2013, compared with 44% in 2007.In 2013, profit margins are expected to vary from 11.9 to 13.9 points, depending on the evolution of the markets, compared with 10.8 in 2011 and 16.6 in 2007.
