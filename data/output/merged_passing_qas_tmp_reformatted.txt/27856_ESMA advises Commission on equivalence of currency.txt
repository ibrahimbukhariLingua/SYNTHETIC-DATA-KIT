ESMA advises Commission on equivalence of currency regulations


The European Securities and Market Authority (ESMA) has published its advice to the European Commission on the equivalence of the regulatory regimes for OTC derivatives clearing, central counterparties (CCPs), and trade repositories (TR) of non-EU countries with the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). ESMA has assessed the equivalence of the regulatory regimes of Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland and the US. It finds the regulatory regimes of Australia and Switzerland for CCPs equivalent to EU rules. Conditional equivalence is proposed to the following regimes: •Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, and the US for CCPs;•the US and Japan for central clearing, requirements for non-financial counterparties and risk mitigation techniques for uncleared trades; and•the US for TRs.The European Commission is expected to use ESMA’s technical advice to prepare possible equivalence decisions. Where it adopts such a decision, certain provisions of EMIR may be disapplied in favour of equivalent third-country rules.For Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Singapore, South Korea and Switzerland, ESMA will be delivering its advice on areas not yet covered by 1 October 2013.
