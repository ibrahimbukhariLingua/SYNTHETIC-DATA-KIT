Legg Mason opens an office in Dublin


Legg Mason on 13 December announced the opening of an office in Dublin, under the name Legg Mason Investments (Ireland), The Dublin office will be the European base for all services related to wealth management, following the exit of Great Britain from the European Union. The US-based wealth management firm already has 80 funds domiciled in Dublin. A team of six people, led by Penny Kily, will now handle requests from European clients. Several recruitments are planned in 2019, including positions in investment surveillance, finance, and risk management. Kyle had previously worked at Martin Currie, an affiliate of Legg Mason, where she had most recently been responsible for North American equities. She has over 20 years of experience in investment, and has been part of the strategic planning team at Legg Mason for two years. The existing European companies of the Legg Mason group in Germany, Italy, Spain and France will in the future become affiliates of LMI Ireland. LMI Ireland has already applied to the Irish central bank for permission to offer clients individual portfolio management services in the wake of Brexit, as well as fund administration services in 27 countries of the European Union. LMI Ireland, founded in 1997, is currently registered with the Irish central bank as a UCITS and alternative fund management firm. Funds from Legg Mason domiciled in Ireland now represent assets of about USD30bn. During next year, the operational management for European distribution of the Irish product range will be transferred from the British arm of LMI Ireland.
