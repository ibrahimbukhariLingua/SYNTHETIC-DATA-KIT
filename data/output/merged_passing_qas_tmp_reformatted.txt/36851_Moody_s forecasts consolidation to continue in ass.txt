Moody’s forecasts consolidation to continue in asset management


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } In a report published on 7 July entitled “Confidence Among Asset Managers Will Drive Greater Industry Consolidation,” Moody’s predicts that there will be a measurable increase in merger and acquisition activity in the asset management industry. “Asset management firms are motivated to buy now, in light of the improving macroeconomic environment, combined with financial positions which have returned to their pre-crisis levels, or even higher,” says Robert Callagy, senior vice president of Moody’s in a statement. “Vendors are also probably more inclined to act now, since the fundamentals of their activities have improved in the past few years, and valuations are very high.” To support its thesis, the ratings agency lists recent merger and acquisition operations which have taken place in the asset management sector, such as the acquisition of Numeric Holdings by Man Group, the acquisition of Nuveen for USD6.25bn by TIAA-CREF, or the acquisition of Ignis Asset Management by Standard Life Investments. For all asset management firms, these operations aim to increase levels of assets under management, to improve economies of scale and diversification, to strengthen investment capacities, and to fill gaps in their business models, Moody’s points out. In this context, merger and acquisition activities in the asset management industry will be very likely to pick up and intensify in the next 12 to 24 months, the ratings agency says. Several factors support this consolidation: improving economic conditions, low volatility on capital markets, solid profits and cash flow, and lastly, favourable market financing. Meanwhile, Moody’s sees two types of vendors on the market: small asset management players who are seeking to reposition themselves, and very large players, such as banks and insurers, who are scaling back to rationalise costs or avoid certain regulatory requirements. The ratings agency also expects major players in the industry to continue to sell off their asset management activities, given the implementation of new financial regulations worldwide.
