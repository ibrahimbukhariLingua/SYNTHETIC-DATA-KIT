Sigma (SAC) analyst pleads guilty to insider trading charges


Jon Horvath, a former analyst at Sigma Capital Management, an affiliate of the hedge fund management firm SAC Capital Advisors, on Friday became the 69th person to plead guilty in an insider trading scandal. He admitted before a Manhattan Federal court that he received insider information on the subject of Dell and Nvidia, and then passed the information on to his boss, the portfolio manager Michael Steinberg, a close ally of the founder of SAC, Steven A. Cohen. Steinberg was not mentioned by name by Horvath, and was not publicly accused, but he is on the list of accomplices not facing charges.
