Bob Rodriguez critics asset managers


Bob Rodriguez, manager of the FCA Capital Fund, says managers have not fully appreciated the scale of the financial crisis, the Wall Street Journal reports. “Whether it’s bonds or equities, it appears that the same old strategies have been used: being fully invested … and not diverging much from the index,” he says. He warns that if active managers continue to manage in this way, they will have trouble maintaining long-term prospects for their funds and keeping their jobs.
