Eurizon to absorb costs of research


Eurizon, the company of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group specialised in managing products and services for retail and institutional customers, has announced that, starting from 3 January 2018, in correspondence with the entry into force of the MIFID II Directive, it will absorb the costs of research in investments concerning the managed products. Massimo Mazzini, Head of Eurizon`s Marketing and Business Development Department, stated: “As active Asset Managers, we believe that research plays a central role in generating new ideas and we continue to use both analyses created internally and research produced externally, to update and improve the entire investment process and to be able to offer the best solutions to customers. We think that the new legislation is going in the right direction and that the approach adopted by Eurizon enhances the quality of the service provided to customers. Therefore, we have decided to absorb the costs associated to external research to keep the level of quality and value unchanged for all our investors, by avoiding charging these expenses to the managed assets. We deem that this approach is the most in line with our vision and growth strategies”.
