G20 looks to create new rules to maintain liquidity at asset management firms

The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is in summer expected to publish a consultation document to lay out recommendations to manage the problem of “structural vulnerabilities” related to asset management firms, the news agency Reuters reports. The chairman of the FSB, Mark Carney, has stated that the Board had agreed on the general terms which would be included in the consultation document. The recommendations are in particular to treat coverage of risks related to liquidity problems or promises to immediately reimburse assets which are infrequently traded on the markets. There is also the issue of managing risks presented by leverage in funds, operational risks, and transfers of investment mandates in situations of stress. The issue of lending securities which funds hold on behalf of investors is also expected to be addressed. The Board had originally planned to treat the largest asset management firms as banks, and to make them systematic establishments. But concerns on the part of management heavyweights and market regulators led the FSB to concentrate instead on activities in the sector.
