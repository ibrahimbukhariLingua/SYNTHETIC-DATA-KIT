Non-financial risks: Professionals want more transparency, information and governance


The major causes of rising non-financial risks are increased complexity of operations (a cause considered significant by 77% of respondents), followed by reduced capacity on the part of some providers to guarantee deposited assets (59%), unclear or inadequate regulations (57%) and lastly, a total lack of responsibility on the part of asset management firms in relation to restitution of assets (53%), according to an Edhec-Risk survey. The study, entitled “Shedding Light on Non-Financial Risks – a European Survey,” was undertaken as part of the second year of work by the research chair in “Risks and regulation of the fund industry in Europe,” created in partnership with Caceis.The study clearly finds that regulatory priorities need to address themes to which the regulator has paid limited attention in its recent work, particularly the MiFID directive. The priorities cited are transparency, information and governance, in relation to regulation of non-financial risks, followed by financial responsibility in the industry. On this latter point, the fact must be underscored that non-financial risks are largely the result of decisions by the asset management firm.
