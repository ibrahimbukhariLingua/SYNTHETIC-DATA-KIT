No decisions have been taken at this stage, the Zurich-based bank says. “In agreement with the regulations of (market operator) SIX, EFG confirms that it is in exclusive talks with BTG Pactual concerning a potential acquisition of BSI,” the group says in a statement. EFG International had been one of the most likely candidates for the acquisition of BSI, with an offer which, according to the Financial Times, was the highest, but other suitors were also cited in the financial press, including Julius Baer and the Italian Intesa Sanpaolo. Several firms had denied that they had any interest in an acquisition of BSI, including Credit Suisse, the Rothschild bank and j. Safra Sarasin.
