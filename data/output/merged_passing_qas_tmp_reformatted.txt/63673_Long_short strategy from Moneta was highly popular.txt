p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Assets under management in the Moneta Long Short fund now total about EUR300m, though they had totalled only EUR160m as of the end of 2015, Patrice Courty, co-director of Moneta AM and manager of the fund, announced on 26 January, at a presentation for investors. Assets under management at Moneta AM, which have also benefited from positive market effect, have risen from EUR3bn as of the end of 2015 to about EUR3.2bn as of the beginning of 2017. The Moneta Long Short fund, launched 10 years ago, has posted annual returns of 5.2% since its inception in late 2006. The management team for the fund has insisted on the importance of the governance criterion in recent years, and this is now at the centre of its investment process, as good governance is synonymous with the best results over the long term and the best market performance, Moneta points out. In the process of analysing a company, governance is considered under at least three headings: shareholders, board of directors, and management. The Spanish Mapfre group has been excluded, since in 2012, its board of directors had 21 members, of whom seven were independent, but it had no expertise in insurance. Since 2015, the board has only had 18 members, and one independent expert in insurance, but development is still too slow in the eyes of analysts at Moneta.
