Europe - CVC successful in fundraising


Steve Koltes, CEO for Germany, has announced that CVC Capital Partners now has EUR16bn to invest, since the fund CVC European Equity Partners V has concluded its fundraising with EUR10.8bn in commitments, the BÃ¶rsen-Zeitung reports. The money will come from 350 institutional investors (half of whom are American), or nine tenths of the investors who subscribed to the first fund for EUR6bn in 2005, and then one year later signed up for the Tandem fund (EUR4.1bn). Those two funds are already 90% and 55% invested, respectively.
