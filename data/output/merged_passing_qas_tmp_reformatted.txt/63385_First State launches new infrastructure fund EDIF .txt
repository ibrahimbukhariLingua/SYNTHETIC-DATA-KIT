This will be the first of a total of three rounds of fundraising. It is aiming for EUR700m, with a limit of EUR900m. “Today we raised about EUR600m, andd we are planning to close this series at the end of March,” Philippe Taillardat, a partner at First State and co-head of infrastructure investments for Europe, tells Newsmanagers.Like the first fund, EDIF 2 has a 15-year life cycle. It is aiming for EUR2bn, with an upper limit of EUR2.5bn.The asset management firm, which has been based in London since the 1990s, has invested 100% of the funds raised by EDIF 1 (EUR2bn) since the acquisition last summer of the French firm Coriance, a specialist in urban heating solutions, from KKR. EDIF 1 has invested in the capital of 11 companies in eight European countries. It was launched in 2009. “It has an average IRR of 11% over its track record,” says Taillardat.Coriance also has the unique quality of being the first investment (via capital sharing) for EDIF 2. In addition to Coriance, a second investment has been secured in Portugal to acquire a wind farm.First State, an affiliate of Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), is the largest asset management firm in Australia.
