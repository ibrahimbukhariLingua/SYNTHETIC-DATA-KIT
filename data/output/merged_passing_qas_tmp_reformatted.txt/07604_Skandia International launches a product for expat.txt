Skandia International launches a product for expats in Spain


Skandia International has developed a product for the Spanish market specifically designed to meet the investment needs of expats living there. The Spanish Collective Investment Bond (CIB) is based on Skandia Internationalâ€™s globally suite of offshore investment products, but has been tailored to be precisely aligned with Spanish tax law. The new Dublin-based product gives expat investors access to a wide range of funds and bank deposits. At launch, there are over 450 available funds across more that 30 investment sectors. These funds are fully compliant with Spanish investment regulations and represent a selection from over 50 investment management companies. The Spanish CIB also allows investors to hold all or part of their portfolio in qualifying Euro deposit accounts and structured deposits. The Spanish CIB can be denominated in Euros, Sterling or US Dollars.
