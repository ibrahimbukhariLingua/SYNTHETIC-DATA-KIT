Swiss banks exposed to more US lawsuits


The director of the Swiss federal financial markets authority (FINMA), Patrick Raaflaub, claikms that more lawsuits by US authorities against Swiss banks are all but inevitable. Even if there is a political solution to the tax conflict between Switzerland and the United States, banks will need to negotiate individually, Raaflaub claims in an interview with the SonntagsZeitung. The Swiss and US governments will only be able to set up a framework for such individual agreements. These “Deferred Prosecution Agreements” will allow legal actions against Swiss banks to be suspended. “That may require costly concessions such as fines and organisational changes,” the director of FINMA comments.
