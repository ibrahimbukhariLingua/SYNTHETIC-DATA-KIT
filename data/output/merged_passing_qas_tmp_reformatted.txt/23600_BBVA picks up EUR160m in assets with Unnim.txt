BBVA picks up EUR160m in assets with Unnim


With its acquisition of the new Unnim savings bank, the result of the merger of three other savings banks (Caixa Terrasa, Caixa Sabadell and Caixa Manlleu), for a symbolic price of one euro, BBVA takes control of the asset management firm Unnim Gesfons, whose assets total EUR160m in three bond funds (EUR61m), one diversified fund (EUR3m), four bond guaranteed funds (EUR85m) and one international equity fund (EUR10m), Funds People reports. With the addition of assets contributed by the open-ended funds at Unnim, BBVA Asset Management will have over EUR20bn in assets. In addition to its directly-managed funds, Unnim also has four funds outsourced to Ahorro Corporación Gestión, and four Sicav funds inherited from Caixa Terrasa, with over EUR500m in assets under management, putting total assets at Unnim at about EUR700m.
