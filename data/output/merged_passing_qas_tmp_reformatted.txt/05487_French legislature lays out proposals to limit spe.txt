French legislature lays out proposals to limit speculation


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } A research commission of the French National Assembly on 21 December submitted 34 proposals to limit speculation and help to end the “casino economy” and “international financial disorder.” The commission, composed of representatives from all parties and led by the Socialist Henri Emmanuelli, calls for stricter regulation, or a complete prohibition, of practices such as high-frequency trading and short-selling, a redefinition of the responsibilities of ratings agencies, and increased responsibility in the financial sector, in order to prevent member states from having to bail them out in times of crisis. The commission also proposes improved regulation of hedge funds, including closer monitoring of the opportunities offered to all hedge funds to acquire a “European passport,” which could open the European market to insufficiently monitored funds, to ensure that the necessary correctives can be achieved in a timely manner. The commission estimates that moves should be made quickly to supplement the AIFM with clauses to allow improved control of these funds and to limit leverage for funds which hold the new European passport. It also proposes that means to establish a distinction between depository banks and investment banks should be considered, and favours moves to combat shadow banking, which has led some financial establishments to remove some of their engagements from their balance sheets.
