Stamp duty on British funds up for review


The British management association (IMA) has welcomed the decision of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to work closely with professionals in the sector to amend the stamp duty regime. The tax, which applies to funds which are licensed for sale in the United Kingdom, may be discontinued. The tax also applies to British funds investing in other funds, although these funds may not invest in British equities. This is the area in which the tax may be discontinued, which would allow funds domiciled in the United Kingdom to once again become competitive with offshore funds. The British government has also announced plans to set up a working group to consider the possible establishment of a tax-transparent contractual fund vehicle. The government is also considering making improvements to the new regime for funds investing in unregulated offshore funds.
