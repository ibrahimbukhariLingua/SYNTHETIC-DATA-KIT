BNY Mellon replaces Newton IM with Boston Company AM


Following the departure of its chief investment officer for North American equities, Simon Laing, who has joined the teams at Invesco (see Newsmanagers of 25 November 2011), Newton Investment Management has decided no longer to provide investment advising to the Newton American Fund, which is available to British investors from BNY Mellon Fund Managers. Newton is not planning to replace Laing immediately. BNY Mellon will now entrust investment advising for the fund to one of its boutiques, Boston Company Asset Management. The product will be renamed as The BNY Mellon American Fund. All of these changes will take place in early 2012.
