UBS and F&amp;C sue Polygon


The UK fund management firms Financial Risk Management and F&C have filed a lawsuit jointly with UBS in a Cayman Islands court, seeking the appointment of independent liquidators for the Polygon Global Opportunities Fund from the British management firm Reade Griffith, the Wall Street Journal reports. The plaintiffs, who invested a total of USD165m in the product, are seeking to accelerate the liquidation of the fund, as Reade Griffith in two years has reimbursed only half of the assets, and is charging commissions of 2.5% (higher than the usual 2%), on the USD1.2bn which remain frozen. In addition, the plaintiffs say that the administrators authorised Polygon management and employees to redeem their shares in 2008, though other shareholders were not allowed to do so.
