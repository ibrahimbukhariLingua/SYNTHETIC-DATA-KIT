FSA to investigate fund fees


Peter Smith, head of investments policy at the Financial Services Authority (FSA), has told Bloomberg, as relayed by Investment Week and Investment Europe, that the British regulator has a hard time understanding why commissions charged by British fund managers are so high, and have been increasing in recent years. The FSA will now be investigating the subject. According to a study in the Review of Financial Studies, average annual fees for British mutual funds are 2.21%, while they are 1.04% in the United States.
