Chinese hedge funds expanding rapidly


Citic Securities Futures, from the Citic Securities group, has created an RMB2bn (USD330m) fund, which will be invested in local hedge funds, the Financial Times reports. The asset management firm Hwabao Securities is launching a similar USD1bn fund in partnership with KKM Capital, a firm which helps Chinese hedge fund firms to establish their activities. This is a sign of the growing interest in hedge funds in China. Six foreign hedge funds have also recently obtained licenses to raise capital from Chinese investors for the first time: Canyon Partners, Citadel, Man Group, Oak Tree, Och-Ziff Capital Management and Winton Capital Management.
