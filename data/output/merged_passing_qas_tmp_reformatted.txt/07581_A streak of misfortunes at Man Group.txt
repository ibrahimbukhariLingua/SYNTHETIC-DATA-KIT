A streak of misfortunes at Man Group


Man Group has endured a run of bad news of late, says the Financial Times. The hedge fund manager is now facing accusations that AHL, its flagship fund, is “broken” following a period of poor performance. It has also experienced a number of staff departures and has seen its acquisition of GLG Partners criticised as too expensive. Man’s shares have fallen 31 per cent in 2010, making the company the subject of bid rumours.
