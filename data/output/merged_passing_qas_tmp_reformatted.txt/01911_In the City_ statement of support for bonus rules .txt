In the City, statement of support for bonus rules not universally popular


The major non-British banks based in the City, including Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Securities, Morgan Stanley Nomura and UBS, were yesterday compelled by an injunction from Paul Myners, secretary of state in charge of the City, to issue a joint statement expressing their “complete support” for the G20 agreement on remuneration, La Tribune reports. Top directors at the banks agree to defer “40% to 60%” of their bonuses for a three-year period, while these bonuses will be paid “at least 50% in equities.” BNP Paribas, Société Générale and Deutsche Bank are dragging their feet. With branches and not affiliates in the United Kingdom, they are not regulated by the FSA. They have announced instead that they “will apply the G20 agreements in accord with regulators in their home countries.”
