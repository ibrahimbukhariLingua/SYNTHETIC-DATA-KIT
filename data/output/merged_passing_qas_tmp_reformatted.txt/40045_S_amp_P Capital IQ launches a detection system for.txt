S&amp;P Capital IQ launches a detection system for potential M&amp;A


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The service provider S&P Capital IQ on 13 February announced the launch of Deal Detector, a new detection tool for businesses which have the same characteristics in terms of valuation and fundamentals as businesses which have already been the targets of acquisition operations. The initiative comes at a time when a marked rise has been observed in merger and acquisition activities worldwide, with an activity volume which last year topped USD2.6trn, the best result since 2007, a statement from S&P Capital IQ states. Deal Detector will then alert investors about potential investment ideas ahead of potential merger and acquisition operations. The tool allows for sectoral trends to be detected without specifying a time horizon for each investment idea, also setting it apart from traditional research, which is generally based on a 12-month timetable.
