Bank of America fined USD33m by SEC


The Financial Times reports that Bank of America will pay a USD33m fine to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator accuses the bank of having provided “materially false and misleading information” to shareholders about bonuses awarded to business bankers at Merrill Lynch, shortly before its acquisition of the investment bank was finalized.
