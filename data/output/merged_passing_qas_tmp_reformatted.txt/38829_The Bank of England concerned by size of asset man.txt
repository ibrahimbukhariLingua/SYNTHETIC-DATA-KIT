The Bank of England concerned by size of asset management firms


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Large asset management firms may represent a risk to the stability of the financial system, Andrew Haldane, executive director for financial stability at the Bank of England, announced, as cited in the Wall Street Journal. At an asset management conference at the London Business School, he said that several asset manaement firms are so large that “difficulties at an asset management firm may aggravate frictions on the financial markets.” Amond these major risks, he cites the case of a fund in difficulty required to sell assets, which would drive down prices on the market. That could trigger another wave of massive sales, which would amplify the fall.
