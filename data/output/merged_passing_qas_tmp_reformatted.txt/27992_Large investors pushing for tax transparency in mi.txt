Large investors pushing for tax transparency in mining industries


A group of leading international investment institutions with USD 5.8tn of assets has urged tough new public disclosure rules for oil, gas and mining companies listed in Canada, even as it has warned against the US rolling back its own disclosure rules in this area, according to a press statement released on August 28.In separate letters to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Natural Resources Canada, the investors - among which Amundi, Allianz GI, Aviva Investors, ING IM and UBS GAM, have urged the adoption of a consistent global standard for all significant tax and royalty payments made by extractive companies across their global operations.The move reflects a growing global trend aimed at deterring corruption in resource-dependent countries, beginning with the passage in 2010 of tough extractive sector transparency provisions within the US Dodd Frank Act. This was followed by equivalent requirements in the EUâ€™s Transparency and Accounting Directives in June 2013, following which Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced plans at the G8 Summit in June to follow suit with similar regulations for Canadian-listed extractive companies.However, a July ruling in a US District Court on a suit filed by the American Petroleum Institute threatens to set back this effort by seeking to block the US regulation, and raises uncertainty for companies and investors operating internationally. Investors have therefore come together to highlight the importance of high standards of transparency as well as consistent global regulation.
