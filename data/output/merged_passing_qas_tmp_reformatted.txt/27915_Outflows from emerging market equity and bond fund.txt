Outflows from emerging market equity and bond funds gather pace


Redemptions from emerging markets equity and bond funds hit nine week highs heading into September as the prospect of less accommodative US monetary policy pummeled equity indexes and currencies. Europe equity funds took in another USD1.3bn in the week ending August 28, but equity funds overall finished the week with net outflows of USD4.8bn, according to statistics from EPFR Global. Bond funds, for their part, saw redemptions totalling a net USD7.1bn. Net flows into money market funds were a modest USD1.7 billion as commitments to US funds were offset by redemptions from Europe and Japan money market funds.
