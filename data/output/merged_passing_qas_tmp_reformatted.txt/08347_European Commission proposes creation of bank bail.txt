European Commission proposes creation of bank bailout funds


The European Commission on 26 May suggested in a statement that the European Union could create a European network of funds to protect against bankruptcies at banks, to prevent taxpayers from having to bear the cost of these bankruptcies, and to prevent them from disrupting the economy as a whole. After submitting its ideas to the next meeting of the European Council, the Commission will present them at the G20, which will be meeting in Toronto on 26 and 27 June 2010. The funds would be integrated into a wider range of measures intended to prevent future financial crises and to strengthen the financial system. The Commission argues that one way to achieve this would be to require member states to constitute funds according to joint guidelines, which banks would be required to contribute to. “The funds would not be intended to bail out or save the banks, but only to guarantee a methodical managemetn of bankruptcies without destabilising the financial system,” the Commission’s statement says.
