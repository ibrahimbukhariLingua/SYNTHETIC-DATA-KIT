Norway’s wealth fund seeking to narrow bond portfolio


Norway’s USD990 billion sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, proposed to streamline its fixed-income portfolio by shortening maturities and cutting corporate bonds and some 20 currencies from the benchmark it tracks, said Reuters. If approved by Norway’s Finance Ministry, the changes would leave only government bonds in U.S. dollars, euros and British pounds as part of the index, which already represents more than 80 percent of the fund’s fixed-income investments.The switch would reduce transaction costs and volatility, while having little impact on overall risk, the central bank, which manages the fund, wrote in a letter to the ministry. The change would not trigger immediate asset sales, but could lead to a gradual move away from the currencies that are cut from the benchmark, including bonds denominated in Japanese yen, Canadian dollars, Swedish crowns and Swiss francs, it said.
