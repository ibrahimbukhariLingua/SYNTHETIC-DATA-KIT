Diamond ETFs soon to be created?


GemShares, a financial firm based in Chicago, is seeking a patent in the United States to allow it to turn diamonds into publicly-traded shares, the Wall Street Journal reports. The firm has created an index which could be used for an ETF. The problem with diamonds is that their price depends on the carat, the colour, the clarity and the cut of the stone, but also on the appreciation of those who buy and sell them.
