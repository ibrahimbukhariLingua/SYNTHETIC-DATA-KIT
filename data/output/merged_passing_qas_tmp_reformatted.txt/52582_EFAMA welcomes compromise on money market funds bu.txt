EFAMA welcomes compromise on money market funds but hopes for improvements in final agreement


The European fund and asset management association has welcomed an agreement on money market funds reached under the Dutch presidency, which takes into account the realities of the market, and represents improvement on crucial points, according to a statement released on 20 June. “ We are nonetheless conscious that the magnitude of the money market funds reform will require a major overhaul of the industry. We also believe that further work is necessary during the Trilogue discussions to safeguard current achievements but also to further ensure that the rules work in practice and secure the viability of all money market funds,” the professional association adds.“ Ultimately, EFAMA believes the final agreement should find the right balance between financial stability and economic growth. Ensuring the viability of MMFs as an alternative source of short-term financing with a crucial role to play in our capital markets is all the more important considering the unprecedented economic, political and societal challenges faced by the European Union today,” says Peter De Proft, director general of EFAMA.
