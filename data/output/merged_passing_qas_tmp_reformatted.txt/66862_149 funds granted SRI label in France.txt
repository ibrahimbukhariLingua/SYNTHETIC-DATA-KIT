149 funds granted SRI label in France


To date, the SRI label promoted by the French finance ministry has been awarded to 149 funds managed by 32 asset management firms, representing assets of EUR41bn, the website of the SRI label reports. The objective for the label, created in 2016, is to make socially responsible products more visible to savings investors in France and Europe. So far, only Afnor Certification is accredited by Cofrac (the semi-public body which assures the quality of labelling). A second organisation, EY France, is in the process of accreditation, meaning that it is not yet accredited, but tht it may still issue the SRI label, the website states. p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; }
