EFA and BCEE win administration mandate for first Islamic money market fund


The Bank of London and Middle east (BLME) has mandated European Fund Administration S.A. (EFA) and the Banque et Caisse d’Epargne de l’Etat (BCEE) for administrative and depository banking services for the first European money market fund to comply with Sharia law, which has been launched in Luxembourg. The BLME Umbrella Fund Sicav-SIF, created with capital of more than USD50m, invested in a diversified portfolio of top quality Islamic money market products such as Murabahas (trading contracts), Sukuks (Islamic equivalents of bonds), and Ijaras (rental contracts for assets). In order to serve BLME and respond to the rapid growth of the Islamic finance market, EFA has adapted its accounting and transfer agency tools and has set up a special training program for its dedicated teams.
