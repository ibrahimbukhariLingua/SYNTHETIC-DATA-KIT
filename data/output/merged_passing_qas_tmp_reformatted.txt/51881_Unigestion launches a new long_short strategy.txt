The strategy, officially launched in mid-May, is based on an “alternative risk premia” investment process, and applies the Unigestion 360-degree management process, the asset management firm says in a statement. The long/short fund will adopt a pure alpha strategy which will aim to profit both from positive and negative exposure to factors which generate returns, such as value, momentum, quality and size. “Through this use of sophisticated portfolio construction, the objective of the strategy is to provide investors with market neutral performance based on an effective long/short risk portfolio,” Unigestion states. The strategy is also available through a daily liquidity UCITS fund structure, the asset management firm states. This is the second factor fund created in collaboration with the client Railpen. In December 2015, Unigestion launched the Equity Compass long-only strategy, which attracted GBP50m in assets in six months.
