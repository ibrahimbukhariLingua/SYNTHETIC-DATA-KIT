FCA fines Santander UK over GBP12m


Santander UK Plc has been fined GBP12,377,800 by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) after the regulator uncovered «serious failings in the way it offered financial advice from its bank», according to a statement.In particular, there was a significant risk of Santander UK giving unsuitable advice to its customers, its approach to considering investors’ risk appetites was inadequate, and for some people it failed to regularly check that investments continued to meet their needs - despite promising to do so.In agreement with the FCA, Santander will now contact all affected customers and, for any sales that were sub-standard, redress will be paid where due.Santander UK agreed to settle at an early stage of the investigation so its fine was reduced by 30%. Were it not for this discount it would have been fined GBP17,682,730.
