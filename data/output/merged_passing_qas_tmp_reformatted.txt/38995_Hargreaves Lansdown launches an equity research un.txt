Hargreaves Lansdown launches an equity research unit


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The British firm Hargreaves Lansdown has decided to set up an equity research team, according to Investment Week. The new team may offer clients of Hargreaves analyst ratings for equities, as well as the perspective of the firm. For the first time in its history, Hargreaves will publish buy/sell recommendations for British equities. The new team, which will be based in Bristol, will be managed by a new head of equity research, who is in the process of being recruited. The new unit comes as an addition to the “execution-only” brokerage activity at Hargreaves, which has progressed strongly in the past few months, due to a growing number of clients and IPOs for top firms such as Royal Mail and Direct Line. Assets under management or administration at Hargreaves Lansdown totalled GBP43.4bn as of the end of 2013, including GBP40.9bn for the Vintage platform.
