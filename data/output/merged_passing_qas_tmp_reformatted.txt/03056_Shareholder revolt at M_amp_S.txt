Shareholder revolt at M&amp;S


A general shareholders’ meeting at Marks & Spencer (M&S) on Wednesday will be lively, the Sunday Times reports. Management at the retail group is refusing to consider a resolution proposed by the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF), which would call for the recruitment of an independent president by 2010, to limit the powers of the firm’s CEO, Sir Stuart Rose, who is currently both president and CEO.
