Vanguard UK launches a range of index funds


Vanguard Investments UK is launching 11 funds based in the United Kingdom and Ireland aimed at British investors. The products will be made available on a few platforms, and will be open to subscriptions beginning on 23 June. They include index funds of equities and bonds, covering various geographical regions. Tom Rampulla, managing director of Vanguard Investments U.K., highlights the low cost of the funds. Annual fees vary between 0.15% for the UK equities product and 0.55% for the emerging markets product. With this new range, Vanguard is seeking to target independent financial advisors, “who are moving away from a model of remuneration based on commissions,” says Rampulla. “We will also work with wealth managers, family offices, providers of defined contribution pension funds, and institutions,” he says.
