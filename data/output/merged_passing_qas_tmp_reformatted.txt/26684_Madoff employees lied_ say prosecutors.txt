Madoff employees lied, say prosecutors


Five former employees of the former firm of Bernard L. Madoff who are currently facing trial produced “millions of pages of lies” which allowed the fraud to persist, prosecutors argued to a jury on the first day of the trial, the Wall Street Journal reports. The trial, which will last 5 months, may be the last and best chance for prosecutors to burst Madoff’s allegation that he carried out the fraud alone.
