SEC considers tougher regulations for money market funds


La Tribune reports that the SEC, the US regulatory authority, is considering toughening the rules for money market funds. The regulator may forbid the purchase of illiquid assets and the imposition of a 5% limit on their exposure to cash and highly liquid assets. The average maturity date for debt in the portfolio may be reduced from 90 to 60 days. In addition, regular stress testing and monthly reporting may be instituted.
