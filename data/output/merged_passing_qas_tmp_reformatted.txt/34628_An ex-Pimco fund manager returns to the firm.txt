An ex-Pimco fund manager returns to the firm


Pimco has hired Jeremie Banet, who previously worked for the firm and will return as an executive vice president and portfolio manager for real return strategies, including Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS).He previously worked for Pimco as a portfolio manager for TIPS and real return strategies from 2011 until 2014. When he returns to the firm on November 3, he will report to Mihir Worah, managing director and chief investment officer - Real Return and Asset Allocation. A Financial Times article reminds that Jeremie Banet had left Pimco because he was unhappy with Bill Gross’s management style. « Nothing crystallised the controversy over Bill Gross’s management style at Pimco so much as the suggestion that one underling was so unhappy he quit to sell croques monsieur from a food truck », writes the article. Bill Gross left Pimco to join Janus at the end of September. Pimco has also named Nobel Laureate economist Michael Spence as consultant. Professor Spence, who is a faculty member of New York University Stern School of Business, previously served in a similar consulting role for Pimco for a number of years until February 2014. He will participate in the company’s Cyclical and Secular Forums and also provide direct input to the firm’s investment committee, as he did during his prior work with Pimco.
