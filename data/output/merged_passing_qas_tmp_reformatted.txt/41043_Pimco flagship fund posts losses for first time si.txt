Pimco flagship fund posts losses for first time since 1999


The Total Return fund, the flagship fund from Pimco, whose assets under management total about USD244bn, has seen its first annual loss since 1999, Investment Week reports. The fund, managed by the co-CIO of Pimco, Bill Gross, lost 2% last year, according to data from Morningstar. In the month of December along, the fund lost 1%, in the wake of a decision by the Federal Reserve to end its quantitative easing policy. The fund has posted its worst result since 1994, when it had a negative performance of 3.6%. US Treasury bonds, which according to Reuters represent about 37% of the portfolio, have seen a difficult second half following indications by the Federal Reserve in May last year that it planned to end its quantitative easing policy.
