Pimco predicts that Franco-German agreement will disappoint markets


Mohammed El. Erian, executive director and co-CIO of Pimco (Allianz Global Investors group), has claimed in FT Alphaville that, insofar as many market operators were predicting that aid provided by Germany would increase, the reaction of the markets to the Merkel-Sarkozy talks yesterday will not be positive: German and US debt will recover, and the gap that separates them from the peripheral countries will widen, Expansión reports. Pimco considers that the message from Germany and France is clear: steps forward to balance budgets and improve economic management must take priority over new aid plans, “eurobonds,” or other solutions designed to save the most heavily indebted peripheral countries. El-Erian says that the surprising fact is not that Germany is defending this position, but that France is also firmly supporting it. That position probably has something to do with the economic warning signs that emerged last week.
