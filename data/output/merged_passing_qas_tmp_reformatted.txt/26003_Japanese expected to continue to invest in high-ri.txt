Japanese expected to continue to invest in high-risk assets


The savings accounts exempt from capital gains and dividend taxes which the Japanese government are expected to introduce in early 2014 may lead Japanese investors to engage more in high-risk assets, according to Nikko Asset Management, Asian Investor reports. The Japanese have cash savings totalling about JPY8.5trn, according to estimates by the Bank of Japan. In a deflationary environment, holding cash may be worthwhile; however, the prospects of the return to an inflationary environment is expected to incite the Japanese to modify their behaviour, Hiroki Tsujimura, chief investment officer at Nikko AM, estimates. According to Nikko AM, Japanese retail investors already placed about USD25bn in equity mutual funds between April and the end of September. This trend is expected to strengthen with the introduction of accounts at the beginning of 2014 similar to British ISAs.
