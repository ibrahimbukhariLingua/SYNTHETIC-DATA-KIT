Clearstream joins BME project for centralised register of over-the-counter transactions


Clearstream Banking (Deutsche Börse group) announced on Monday that it is teaming up with Bolsas y Mercados Españoles (BME) to create a register of transactions, which will offer reporting services for over-the-counter (OTC) transactions on a wide range of financial instruments. The initiative comes ahead of expected legislative measures by the European Commission, which will aim to improve operational control and transparency in trading of derivatives over the counter. The new transaction register will be available to all financial and non-financial establishments. It will aim for “flexible” participation, depending on the profiles and needs of various groups of actors and interests in the OTC market. The first tests will take place in July, and an operational phase will begin later, in fourth quarter. Initially, collection of data on transactions will be limited to fixed income derivatives (IRA, FRA, Cap and Floor). In a second phase, the spectrum will widen to include over-the-counter derivatives of bonds, equities, currencies, commodities, and other underlyings.
