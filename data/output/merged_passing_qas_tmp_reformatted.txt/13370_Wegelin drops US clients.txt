Wegelin drops US clients


The Swiss private bank Wegelin on 5 July confirmed that it is going to part with its US clients as a result of new tax regulations in preparation in the United States, which it estimates will make it unprofitable to serve these clients, AGEFI Switzerland reports. “With the entry into force of the new rules, known as FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act), in 2013, the question must be asked as to whether it is profitable to have US clients due to the considerable regulatory work involved,” Albena Björck, a board member at the firm, has told AFP. “If we can no longer conduct activities in a manner which is acceptable in terms of costs and revenues, we will need to part with them,” she adds, confirming reports that had appeared in the daily newspaper Tages-Anzeiger.
