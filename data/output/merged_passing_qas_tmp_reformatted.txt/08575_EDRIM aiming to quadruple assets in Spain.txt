EDRIM aiming to quadruple assets in Spain


In an interview with Funds People, Guillaume Poli, chairman of the managing board at the French asset management firm Edmond de Rothschild Investment Managers (EDRIM, LCF Rothschild group) says that his objective is to achieve EUR1bn in assets in Spain, compared with EUR250m currently. He admits, however, that in the current phase, there is not much growth, and that assets under management are holding stable. The range of products on sale in Spain from EDRIM (which has had a physical presence in Madrid for four months) includes 11 funds, but five more will soon join them. These will include a UCITS hedge fund, three equities funds with respective exposures of 0-35%, 25-75%, and 60-100%. The fifth fund will be a structured product with an exposure of 70-100% to emerging markets, with a capital guarantee and low volatility.
