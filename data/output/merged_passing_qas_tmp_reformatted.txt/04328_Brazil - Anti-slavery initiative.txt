Brazil - Anti-slavery initiative


HSBC Global Asset Mangement, Banco Real Asset Management and Unibanco Asset Management are part of a group of managers who will send a letter to all companies listed on the Brazilian stock exchange, Bovespa, to make them aware of the commercial, financial and publicity risks associated with slavery and indentured labour, Responsible Investor reports. The letter encourages publicly traded companies to sign up to a Brazilian national pact to eliminate slavery, which is being promoted by the International Labour Organization (ILO), Ethos, and the NGO Reporter Brazil. Managers are also calling on businesses to require their suppliers to adhere to the pact and to set up monitoring mechanisms.
