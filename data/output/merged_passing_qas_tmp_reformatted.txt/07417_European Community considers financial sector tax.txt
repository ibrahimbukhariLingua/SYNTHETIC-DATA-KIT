European Community considers financial sector tax


Taxation of the financial sector, including a potential tax on financial transactions, could raise tens of billions of Euros in added revenues, Agefi reports. The European Commission (EC) is successively examining taxation of banking activities, including new taxes already imposed in France, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, and taxes on financial transactions which European countries are not willing to commit to unilaterally. The EC says revenues from a banking tax would total EUR26bn per year for the 27 EU countries, with the widest application (taxation of all profits and remunerations). A tax on transactions would raise much larger sums than a banking tax, but Brussels admits that it is also more difficult to put in place, the newspaper notes. Revenues would vary from EUR145bn to EUR172bn per year, depending on the range of application (equities, bonds, derivatives). London would account for most of the revenues (over 70%).
