Lyxor AM to launch ETFs in physical replication


In September, Lyxor International Asset Management announced plans to launch a range of physical ETFs by the end of 2012. On December 6th and 11th, 4 ETFs based on the EuroMTS Macro Weighted AAA Government Index series will be converted to physical replication. As announced previously, Lyxor diversifies its offer to physically replicated ETFs in order to fully address investors’ needs.The funds will be managed using full replication: each fund will invest directly in all the sovereign bonds that make up the respective EuroMTS Macro Weighted AAA Government Index, without any sampling. Securities lending is not part of the management process as the performance benefit to investors would be negligible, and would not justify the addition of counterparty risk to the fund. The EuroMTS Macro-Weighted AAA Government Bond Indices are Eurozone sovereign indices grouped by maturity, and based on issuers with the highest credit ratings (denoted “AAA”) from 2 out of the 3 main ratings agencies. The “macro-weighted” strategy is an innovative weighting methodology that uses macroeconomic indicators. Country weights are primarily based on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and then adjusted using the following 4 indicators: debt to GDP ratio; current account (as a % of GDP); quarter-on-quarter GDP growth; long-term interest rates.
