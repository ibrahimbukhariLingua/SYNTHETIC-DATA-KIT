Moody’s gives US credit rating a negative outlook


Fitch and Moody’s on Tuesday evening reacted to Barack Obama’s signing of a compromise bill to raise the US debt ceiling. Although Fitch has opted for the status quo for the moment, Moody’s assigned the United States a negative outlook on its credit rating, Agefi reports. Fitch says that it will undertake a review of the rating, a regular process which will take place by the end of the month. The Fitch analyst responsible for the United States, David Riley, has told Reuters that the agency cannot rule out the possibility of assigning the country a negative outlook once the review is completed.
