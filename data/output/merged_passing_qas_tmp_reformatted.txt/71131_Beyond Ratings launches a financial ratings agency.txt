Beyond Ratings launches a financial ratings agency for Paris Agreement


Beyond Ratings, an independent macro-financial risk evaluation agency dedicated to country and sovereign risks, has announced the creation of a financial ratings agency, which will systematically integrate analysis of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. The ratings methodology developed for this purpose will take into account physical and transition climate risks. “This falls right in line with the Paris Agreement, and meets the recommendations of the HLEG2 report, recently submitted to the European Commission,” a statement says, adding that it is the first financial ratings agency to be created under the Paris Agreement.The project has the support of major institutional players, such as the Agence Français de Développement (AFD), the Caisse des Dépôts, and the Fonds Français pour l’Environnement Mondial (FFEM). It is also supported by several global bodies specialised in sustainable development issues: Climate-KIC, Ethos Foundation, Global Footprint Network. These partners together participate in the definition of ratings standards adapted to the challenges of the 21st century. Ratings from the agency will cover public issuers (sovereign, sub-sovereign and supranational bodies), and Beyond Ratings will issue its first ratings by the end of 2018, after ESMA accreditation is obtained.
