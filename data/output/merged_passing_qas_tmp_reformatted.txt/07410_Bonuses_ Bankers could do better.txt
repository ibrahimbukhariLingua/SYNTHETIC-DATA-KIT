Bonuses: Bankers could do better


Les Echos reports that a study by the Institute of International Finance (IIF) has found that banks overall are compliant with the recommendations of the G20 on remuneration. But one year after the G20 met in Pittsburgh, there is still progress to be made. The recommendations made at the summit called for banks to involve boards of directors and risk functions more in remuneration policies, and to pay out bonuses in gradual payments over time, in order to better take the risks involved and the cost of capital into account in calculating bonuses.
