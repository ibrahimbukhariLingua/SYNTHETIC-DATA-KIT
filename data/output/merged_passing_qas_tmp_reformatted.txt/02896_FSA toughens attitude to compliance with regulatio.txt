FSA toughens attitude to compliance with regulations


The Financial Times reports that representatives of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) are now more frequently attending board meetings at banks, from whom they are demanding more financial information, and occasionally questioning the business plans. The regulator has also increased the number of businesses it considers strategically important by half, to 75.“In general, FSA inspectors are now much less confident in bankers,” says Lyndon Nelson, head of risk at the FSA. On the other hand, many bankers are raising questions about the level of competence of professionals at the regulatory authority, but Nelson responds that major training and recruitment efforts have been undertaken.
