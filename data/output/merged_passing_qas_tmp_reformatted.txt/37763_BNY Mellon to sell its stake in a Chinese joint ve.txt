The joint venture, founded in July 2010, is based in Shanghai, and has capital of CNY200m (USD32m). The other shareholder is the Chinese broker Western Securities Co. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, BNY Mellon did not wish to comment on the rumours. The newspaper suggests, however, that the Chiense asset management firm Shanghai Leadbank Asset Management may acquire its 49% stake, also according to the same source familiar with the matter.
