United States - BofA: more layoffs to come


The Financial Times reports that Bank of America is planning to lay off several thousand employees in its capital markets activities. The reports come three weeks after the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by BofA. The measures will affect 4,000 staff, largely in New York. In light of Merrill’s historically strong presence in capital markets, many BofA employees had been sceptical that their jobs would be at risk. But Merrill’s announcement of USD21.5bn in operating losses last week has raised questions about the competence of its teams.
