Institutionals asking businesses to engage to use renewable energies


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } 20 institutional investors with assets under management of over GBP331bn have asked the largest international companies to engage to use renewable energies. To achieve this, they are asking them to join RE100, a collaborative initiative which valorizes businesses that publicly promote the use of 100% renewable energies for their international activities. Google and BMW Group are among the lead companies to have joined the initiative last week, and are among the original members of the initiative, a statement from the ERAFP says, alongside investors such as Aviva Investors, Strathclyde Pension Fund, Environment Agency Pension Fund and Menhaden Capital. At the beginning of this week, six new companies, including Pearson, announced that they would be joining the RE100 initiative. The initiative is coordinated by ShareAction, a charity to promote sustainable investment. The new investor initiative programme aims initially to engage in dialogue with companies in writing, and then to extend dialogue on the subject through meetings and at general shareholdersâ€™ meetings.
