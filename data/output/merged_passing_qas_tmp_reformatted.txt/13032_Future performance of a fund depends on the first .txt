Future performance of a fund depends on the first six months of its life


Before investing in a new fund, investors would do well to observe the performance of the fund in the first six months of its life. According to a study by Dennehy Weller & Co, cited by Investment Week, a fund which has posted good performance in this period has an 84% chance of maintaining solid performance for the first three years. The opposite is also true: funds whose performance is mediocre in the first six months generally do not manage to reverse the trend in the following months.
