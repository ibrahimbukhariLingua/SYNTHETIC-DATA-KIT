Pioneer Investments reconsiders presence in Russia


Pioneer Investments may sell off its activities in Russia, but Unicredit, its parent company, would retain its own activities there, Agefi reports. The newspaper cites a statement from the asset management unit of the bank, stating that it is finalising a new strategic plan to accelerate organic growth, and that as a part of that plan, it confirms that it is reexamining strategic options for its activities in Russia. The Russian unit represents only EUR63m out of the total of EUR178m in assets under management at Pioneer, an affiliate which is responsible for less than 10% of profits at UniCredit.
