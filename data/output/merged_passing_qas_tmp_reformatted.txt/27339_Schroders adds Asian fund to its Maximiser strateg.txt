Schroders adds Asian fund to its Maximiser strategy


The range of seven British and Luxembourg-registered Maximiser funds (USD3.9bn in assets as of the end of August) has gained a new fund, Schroder ISF Asian Dividend Master, which aims for regular monthly returns corresponding to 7% per year. It will invest in high yielding equities from the Asia-Pacific region (ex Japan) and will use the same two-pronged strategy as the other Maximiser funds, which adds an overlay of covered call options to an actively-managed portfolio of Asian higher yielding equities and a market capitalisation of over USD2bn.The Schroder ISF Asian Dividend Maximiser is managed by the same team as the British version, led by Thomas See, head of structured fund management, who is responsible for the overlay strategy, while Richard Sennit is manager of the Schroder Asian Income Fund, responsible for stock-picking.Schroders states that a portion of the portfolio will be left without call options, which will allow the management team to invest in equities and markets where options activity is more limited, or in which the potential for appreciation may be particularly high.CharacteristicsName: Schroder ISF Asian dividen Maximiser (A shares, accumulation)Date of launch: 18 September, 2013Base currency: USDBenchmark inde: MSCI AC Pacific ex Japan (NDR)Front-end fee: maximum 5%Management commission: 1.50%
