Guggenheim and Deutsche Bank enter final negotiations


According to sources familiar with the matter, Guggenheim Partners would pay about USD2bn for the asset management unit of Deutsche Bank, slightly less than the USD2.15bn it spent to buy the LA Dodgers baseball team, Handelsblatt reports. Negotiations are expected to be completed somewhere between mid-April and mid-May. If this occurs, Guggenheim would at a stroke quintuple its assets under management (currently USD164bn), and its headcount would rise from 1,700 to 3,200. Apparently, Guggenheim would also hire Kevin Parker, the present head of asset management at the German bank.
