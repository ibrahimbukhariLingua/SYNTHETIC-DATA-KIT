Nomura and Tradition launch a platform dedicated to ETFs


The multilateral trading facility (MTF) Navesis-ETF was opened on 20 February by the Swiss-listed firm Compagnie Financière Tradition and Nomura. It is a fully electronic platform for the transparent and efficient trading of ETFs, increasing liquidity and reducing fees, all in an environment in perfect compliance with current regulations.Navesis-ETF allows actors (institutional investors, sell-side banks and market makers) to make intra-day trades and to execute orders at net asset value in real time. The promoters say the open architecture platform is the first to offer such functionality. It uses proprietary Tradition technology and Nomura’s expertise as a top-calibre actor in the primary ETF market, and the largest investment bank to have created an MTF dark pool.
