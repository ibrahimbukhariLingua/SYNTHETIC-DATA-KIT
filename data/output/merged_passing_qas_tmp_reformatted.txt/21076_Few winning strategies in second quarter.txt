Few winning strategies in second quarter


Facing a debt crisis in the euro zone, slowing growth in China, a potential new round of quantitative easing in the United States and a continuation of the Arab Spring, investors have recently had a limited appetite for risk, and have reduced their exposure to Europe and to Asian emerging markets. In the last week of June, equity funds saw redemptions totalling EUR7.7bn, while bond funds posted net inflows of USD4.7bn, according to estimates from EPFR Global. Over the past quarter overall, only US and global bond funds have managed to attract more tan USD10bn in assets. Japanese equity funds finished the quarter with inflows of USD5.6bn, and USd5.49bn in first quarter, compared with inflows of less than USD2bn in the first six months of 2011. However, European equity funds have seen their heaviest quarterly outflows since third quarter 2008. After a very good start, emerging market equity funds have seen redemptions totalling USD10.5bn for second quarter as a whole, with over USD8bn to contribute to Asia ex Japan equity funds. Inflows to high yield bond funds slowed in mid-May, and dividend equity funds underwent redemptions in June for the first time in over two years. Money market funds finished the quarter with outflows of USD19.67bn, which is due to redemptions from US money market funds of USD28.39bn. In Europe, money market funds posted inflows of USD6.5bn in second quarter. In the past six months, inflows to money markets total USD115.35bn, compared with slightly over USD49bn in first half 2011.
