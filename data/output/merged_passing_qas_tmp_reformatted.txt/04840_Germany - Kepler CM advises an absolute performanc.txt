Germany - Kepler CM advises an absolute performance bond fund


The KCM Fund -RiskProtect I has been available in Germany since 3 February from Alceda Fund Management SA. It is a Luxembourg-registered product managed by Cornelius Schulte-Noelle of Kepler Capital Markets. The UCITS III-compliant bond fund aims to provide absolute returns through the use of a trend-tracking system which allows the manager to actively vary the target duration from +6 to -2, in order to provide aâ€¯?stop-loss? when trends reverse and to capture gains when the price objective has been met. The portfolio will include bonds denominated in Euros from top-rated issuers.Front-end fee and management commission will total a maximum of 5% and 0.555%, respectively. A 15% commission will also be charged on outperformance of the benchmark index (EB.REXX Government Bond 1,5-2,5), with high watermark, on a half-yearly basis.
