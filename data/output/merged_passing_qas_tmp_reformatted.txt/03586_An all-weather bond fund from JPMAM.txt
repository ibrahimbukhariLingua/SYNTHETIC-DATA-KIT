An all-weather bond fund from JPMAM


Last fall, when the economic crisis was at its worst, JPMorgan Asset Management launched a mutual fund investing in bonds and aiming to confront very difficult market conditions, entitled Strategic Income Opportunities. It is still too soon to say whether it has achieved its objective, the Wall Street Journal notes, but the fund is not fettered by the hindrances that retail bond funds ordinarily face. It is not required to replicate the weighting of a broad index, and it is authorised to invest only where the manager, William Eigen, head of absolute and opportunistic fixed-income strategies, estimates that the potential gains outweigh the risks. The fund may hold a considerable cash allocation (50% currently, compared with 85% at the end of 2008), and it is authorised to short-sell (32% of positions as of the end of March).
