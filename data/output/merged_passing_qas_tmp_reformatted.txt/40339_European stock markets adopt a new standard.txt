European stock markets adopt a new standard


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }The Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE) and FIX Trading Community have announced that the Market Model Typology (MMT) has become a FIX standard. As a result the standard is available for adoption by all market participants. This will allow them to enhance data standardisation and provide greater clarity on the types of activity conducted. This will all contribute to enhanced transparency for the benefit of investors, market participants and regulators. The MMT initiative was originally launched by FESE to support the implementation of the original 2010 CESR recommendations on post-trade reporting standards. MMT will make it easier to consolidate data from multiple venues to create a European consolidated post-trade tape.
