If the transaction goes through, it would be the largest in the Japanese real estate sector since the financial crisis. The skyscraper, put up for sale by Secured Capital, which belongs to the Asian private equity firm PAG, was subject to a call for offers which was won by the Singapore sovereign fund, beating out the asset management division of Goldman Sachs.
