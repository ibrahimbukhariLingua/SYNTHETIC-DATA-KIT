Swedish equity funds post outflows in February


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } In February, a turbulent month on the global stock markets, equity funds on sale in Sweden posted net outflows of SEK8.2bn, or more than EUR800m, according to the most recent statistics from the Swedish fund association Fondbolagens FÃ¶rening. Outflows were particularly heavy from Swedish equity funds, which saw outflows of over SEK4bn. In January, equity funds had inflows of SEK12bn in 2017, or about SEK47bn. These redemptions dragged down total flows to funds, which saw outflows of SEK1.2bn. Inflows in other categories may have been positive, but not with much dynamism. Bond funds attracted only SEK1.1bn, and diversified funds, EUR600m. Money market and hedge funds did little better, with SEK2.6bn and SEK2.7bn, respectively. Despite these redemptions, assets in funds rose by SEK23bn, to SEK4.098trn, or EUR403bn, a new record. Of this total, about 59% is placed in equity funds.
