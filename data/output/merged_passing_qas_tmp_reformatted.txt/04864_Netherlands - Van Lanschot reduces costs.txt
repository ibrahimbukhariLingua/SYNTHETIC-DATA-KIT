Netherlands - Van Lanschot reduces costs


Van Lanschot, which already had decided to cut the fixed salary of its managing board members by 10%, on Friday said the same measure will apply to members of the supervisory board. Senior managementâ€™s pays will be decreased by 7%. The bank also plans to cut about 150 FTEs, which will translate into several dozens of redundancies.
