United Kingdom - Aberdeen neutralises a large part of net outflows


Thanks to positive market effects of GBP5.28bn which more than compensated for net redemptions of GBP4.99bn, Aberdeen Asset Management succeeded in limiting the decline to its assets in the first quarter of its fiscal year, beginning 30 September, to GBP0.9bn. The reduction represents only 18% of net outflows. Assets under management decreased to GBP110.2bn. Gross outflows were GBP7.6bn, and particularly heavily affected bond funds.Aberdeen had assets at the end of December of GBP83.15bn in equities, bond, and multiple asset class funds, compared with GBP85.74bn three months earlier, while assets managed by the real estate unit totalled GBP27.04bn, compared with GBP25.38bn.
