UK firm GPP launches a new service


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The UK firm Global Prime Partners (GPP) has announced the launch of the first prime brokerage service in Europe, which provides settlement, custody, securities lending and financing services to new hedge funds. GPP will initially focus on young hedge funds or managers starting out in the profession, with less than USD100m in assets under management. “This market segment is not correctly covered by the major banks, and represents a major opportunity for GPP. Capital flows in hedge funds are smaller than a few years ago, and many managers start out with USD5m to USD25m in assets. We can help them to start out, to manage at a lower cost, and to provide a new, more robust service than the major banks,” says Kevin LoPrimo, head of prime brokerage at GPP.
