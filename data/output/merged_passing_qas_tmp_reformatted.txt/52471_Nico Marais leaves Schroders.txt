Nico Marais leaves Schroders


Nico Marais has left Schroders, where he had been Head of Multi-asset Investments and Portfolio Solutions, a statement has announced. His departure has resulted in a reshuffle of the activity, which will be split into two teams, under three different individuals who have been working at the company for a long time. The position of Marais will therefore not be replaced as such. The multi-asset investments team will be led by Johanna Kyrklund, Global Head of Multi-asset Investments, who, however, will continue to lead the global asset allocation committee. This team «will continue to focus on multi-asset investing with an emphasis on dynamic asset allocation and portfolio construction», a press statement says.The portfolio solutions team will be co-led by John McLaughlin and Andrew Connell. She will focus on the creation of custom partnerships and solutions with clients. “This simplified structure will allow each team to focus on their core strengths, expand their capabilities and design solutions for our clients’ specific requirements,” says Peter Harrison, the new CEO of Schroders.Marais arrived at Schroders in late 2010 from BlackRock.
