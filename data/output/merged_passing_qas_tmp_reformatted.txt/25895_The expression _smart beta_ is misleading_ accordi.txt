The expression “smart beta” is misleading, according to iShares


Many new indices labelled at “smart beta” have appeared in the past few years in various asset classes and market segments. These are index-based strategies which differ from strategies founded on cap-weighted indices, which are most often used in index-based equity and bond management.But for iShares, the BlackRock company dedicated to ETFs, the name is “misleading.” It implies that strategies not founded on market capitalisations earn higher returns than those which are called “traditional” (and thus more widespread).“New sources of beta, including indices which are not weighted according to market capitalisation, are not necessarily better or more effective. They are simply different,” says Ursula Marchioni, iShares EMEA Investment Strategies and Insights at BlackRock, director, who on Friday presented its latest guide in Paris, the “art of index-based management.” For example, between 1996 and 2000, the equally-weighted S&P 500 index (each security has the same weight) outperformed the traditional S&P 500 index with dividends reinvested (cap-weighted). But between 2000 and 2003, the opposite is true, Marchioni shows.In order to better reflect reality, Benoit Sorel, director at iShares, thus proposes to call these indices “alternative beta.”At any rate, iShares is predictng growth in index-based management, both in terms of asset and available strategies. This trend will be driven by thee factors: increasing popularity with investors, extended product coverage and an increasing mixing of index-based vehicles. On this last point, Sorel deels that it will largely profit index-based funds, ETFs and segregated mandates, rather than derivative products, which are subject to stricter regulations.
