Three former bond managers from Axa IM launch their own funds


Hannah Strasser, Tom Kelleher and Anne Yobage, three high yield bond specialists who worked as a team at AXA Investment Managers for 20 years before leaving the asset management affiliate of Axa last year, are going back to work. The three have launched the US High Yield Fund and US Short Duration High Yield Fund, two “flagship” funds from SKY Harbor Global Funds, the Luxembourg-registered, UCITS IV-compliant SICAV from the boutique SKY Harbor Capital Management, LLC, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, USA. The funds were launched simultaneously. The two sub-funds in question, which are open to non-American investors, will be registered in several European countries. Institutional investors will be able to subscribe for shares denominated in US dollars, or hedged against currency risks in a range of currencies, including the Swiss franc, euro and pound Sterling. The investment process at SKY Harbor, which currently has USD800m in assets under management, is based on fundamental analysis, complemented by qualitative and technical evaluation, in order to identify potential revenues while effectively managing risks.
