Brutal audit for portfolio of Morgan Stanley P2 Value fund


On Thursday, the German asset management firm Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investment announced that an independent audit of the portfolio of the P2 Value fund found a total depreciation of EUR231m, or 10.4%, in the market value of its assets. This corresponds to about 13.9% of assets in the fund, and the liquid value of one share in the fund was lowered on 23 July by about EUR7.50, to EUR53.74.The fund is reopening to subscriptions from this Friday, 24 July, but redemptions will continue to be frozen, as they have been since late October. The board of directors of Morgan Stanley REI will meet in September/October to determine whether liquidity levels are sufficient to allow redemptions to be reopened. Assets as stated on the firmâ€™s website on Thursday totalled EUR1.66bn. After the correction, they will thus total EUR1.43bn.
