John Paulson’s fund recuperates USD550m from Lehman


John Paulson’s fund will get back more than half a billion US dollars under a new agreement under the Lehman Brothers liquidation plan, the Financial Times reports. The settlement, which was approved by 30 financial groups, will allow Paulson & Co. to recuperate USD550m due to its acquisition of bonds at a steep discount (about 7.3 cents on the dollar) at the time the bank went bankrupt. According to the final agreement, holders of Lehman bonds will receive 21.1 cents for each dollar in face value, compared with an initial offer of 17.1 cents. This is a welcome gain for Paulson’s fund (USD38bn in assets under management), which has seen several setbacks in recent months.
