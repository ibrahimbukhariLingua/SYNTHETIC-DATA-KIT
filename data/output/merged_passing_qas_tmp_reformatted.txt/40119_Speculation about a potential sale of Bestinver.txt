Speculation about a potential sale of Bestinver


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Bestinver may soon be changing hands. According to several sources in the Spanish media, its largest shareholder, Acciona, is disposed to consider potential bids for its asset management affiliate. For good reason. The Spanish firm, specialised in infrastructure and services, has a lot of debt and is suffering the brunt of the most recent electricity reforms, which require the Entrecanales family, a shareholder in Acciona, to look at various options to unload non-strategic assets, including the asset management firm Bestinver. The challenge is far from easy: Acciona needs to unload several assets or affiliates to make up the gap of EUR350m related to recent regulatory changes in Spain. Although Acciona refuses all comment, several sources close to the Entrecanales family, cited by El Confidencial, confirm that the sale, as well as the real estate management firm, would be part of a restructuring plan announced in mid-2013, which aimed for EUR500m to EUR1bn in divestment. Bestinver, whose assets under management total EUR9bn, could be valued at EUR250m to EUR530m on the basis of an operating profit of EUR75m, according to El Confidencial. According to market sources cited by other Spanish media sources, the potential buyer of Bestinver could be a foreign private equity fund. Regardless of the valuation of the asset management firm and its potential buyer, the operation will have to be approved by the current managers and directors of Bestinver, key agents in the success of the asset management firm.
