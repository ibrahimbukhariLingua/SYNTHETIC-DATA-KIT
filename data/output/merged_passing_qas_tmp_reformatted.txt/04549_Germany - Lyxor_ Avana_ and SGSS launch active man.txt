Germany - Lyxor, Avana, and SGSS launch active management based on ETFs


?Active solutions with passive ETFs? and strict risk management is the theme around which a cooperation agreement officially signed on Wednesday by Lyxor Asset Management, Avana Investment, and Société Générale Securities Services KAG, is organized. The common point between the firms is that they are all led by former directors from Indexchange and Pioneer, from the time when both firms were owned by HypoVereinsbank (HVB). The objective is to adapt the ETF product range, beyond simple products, to include genuine asset allocation and effective risk management, which is a concept of interest to a growing number of investors. This area forms the particular niche fo the new management firm Avana (see Newsmanagers of 6 February), which uses a trend-monitoring model applicable to all asset classes for which ETFs are available.Each partner will bring its own expertise to the the announced partnership: Lyxor AM (Société Générale group) is one of the foremost European issuers of ETFs, while Avana is an asset manager and risk manager, and SGSS Germany will provide its expertise in the area of fund administration; it currently administers 550 funds with assets of EUR55bn.
