Four managers found AR boutique


Four former fund managers from the asset management firm MEAG (Munich Re group) have decided to create a boutique specialised in absolute returns, Citywire reports. The new entity, entitled Skalis, which will be based near Munich, has not yet received clearance from the supervisory authorities. The initiative follows the departure last month of the bond manager Ingmar Przewlocka, with three other colleagues, Jens Bies, Andreas Grassl and Marc Decker, to found the new firm. Grassl and Decker also worked at MEAG while Bies comes from Deka Asset Management. The four partners are planning to launch a strategy which will be inspired by the MEAG Eurorent fund, and which will invest primarily in European bonds, but which may also be exposed to equities and may introduce derivatives.
