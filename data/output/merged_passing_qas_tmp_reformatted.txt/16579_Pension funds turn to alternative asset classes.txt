Pension funds turn to alternative asset classes


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The international investment advising agency bfinance on 1 February published the results of the fifth edition of its half-yearly survey of asset allocation by pension funds and insurance companies, which includes 50 institutional investors in Europe and North America, representing total assets under management of EUR149bn.In the short and mid-term, institutional investors are planning to reduce the proportion of their portfolios dedicated to traditional assets (equities and bonds) in favour of alternative asset classes, particularly real estate, infrastructure and private equity. This trend is similar to what was observed in June 2010, by the previous edition of the survey.However, contrary to expectations, international pension funds became negative on bonds between June and December 2010, due to tensions that developed for European government debt. The survey shows a total of 12% of respondents who reduced their allocation to bonds in second half 2010.This trend away from bonds is expected to continue in first half 2011 (with a total of 27% of respondents planning to reduce their allocations to bonds). However, it is less marked on a horizon of three years (total 6%).For equities, the trend is still significantly negative on a three-year horizon (a total of 14% planning to reducer investment). This suggests that the recent rise in interest in this asset class may be short-lived.A desire to diversify portfolios, which is highly marked on the six-month and three-year horizons, will largely benefit real estate and other alternative asset classes. Infrastructure and private equity have the strongest number of investors planning to increase exposure (14% and 10% on six month and three year horizons, respectively).
