Wealth management will need to rethink its model

Growth in assets under management can be expected to slow, from 7% of average annual growth in the past five years to 5% per year until 2020, due to low returns, according to a study of the outlooks for the wealth management industry (“Running Faster to Stand Still,”) released on 4 November by Oliver Wyman, and carried out in partnership with Deutsche Bank Research. Commissions will probably suffer due to higher transparency standards, the emergence of new competitors, and movement to passively-managed products. “The sources of performance for wealth management have changed in the past few years, and the players in the industry will need to take measures on costs and develop more customer relationships to maintain revenues,” explains Philippe Bongrand, partner asset management at Oliver Wyman. The industry can be expected to explore new sources of creation of value, such as platforms which allow investors to access investment opportunities in direct real estate or in growth sectors, for example.
