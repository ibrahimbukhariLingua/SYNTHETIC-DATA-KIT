Swiss Life AM aims for EUR1bn for its second infrastructure fund


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Swiss Life Funds (Lux) Global Infrastructure Opportunities 2, the second fund from Swiss Life Asset Managers to invest in infrastructure projects, is seeking to raise at least EUR1bn by February 2018, via successive closings over 2017. The fund, launched in 2016, is aimed at institutional investors, and has already undergone two first closings, in August and December 2016, which raised EUR809m, of which EUR735m were engaged by the Swiss Life group. Of the capital already raised, EUR280m has already been engaged: a first investment has been made in Italy, in infrastructure managed by Società Gasdotti Italia, a natural gas transport operator regulated by the Italian authorities (AEEGSI). Two other deals have been signed and will soon be finalised: one in National Grid Gas Distribution in the United Kingdom, a natural gas distributor regulated by the British authority (OFGEM), and one in Portugal, in a portfolio of seven turnpike motorways. Several infrastructure projects eligible for investment are under study in Europe, Canada and the United States. Assets which generate recurrent cash flow, which are ongoing sources of revenues, in the transportation sector (airports, motorways, etc.) and energy sector (distribution and transport of gas and electricity, renewable energy, etc.) are being sought. “We are concentrating our attention on core infrstructure projects, meaning those which are regulated or guaranteed by long-term contracts. We are targeting an intermediate risk level between those of bonds and equities,” explains Emmanual Lejay, executive director of the investment team at Swiss Life Asset Managers. The management team is seeking to generate net annual returns of 6% to 8%, of which 5% are contributed by dividend flows. Swiss Life Asset Managers is also present on the supervisory boards of more than half of the companies in its portfolio.
