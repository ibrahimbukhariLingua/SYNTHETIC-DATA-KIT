The SEC charges a longtime Madoff employee


The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged a longtime Bernie Madoff employee with fraud for his role in creating fake trades to facilitate the massive Ponzi scheme.The SEC alleges that David Kugel, who worked at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS) for nearly four decades, was asked by Madoff to provide the firm’s investment advisory operations with backdated arbitrage trade information to be formulated into fictitious trading on investors’ account statements. Kugel’s own account at BMIS was among those in which backdated trades were entered, and he withdrew nearly USD10 million in “profits” from the fictitious trading over several years."Kugel helped Madoff maintain the elaborate and enduring facade that his clients were engaged in actual trading when in fact no such trading occurred,» said George S. Canellos, Director of the SEC’s New York Regional Office. «Kugel withdrew millions of dollars of phony profits that he knew weren’t from actual trading activity.»
