AIMA favours depository passports


The International Alternative Management Association (AIMA) has announced that it favours a depository passport for UCITS-compliant funds, in its response to a consultation on the UCITS V directive. It approves of the majority of the contents of the proposals.In a statement released on 22 October, the association observes that the development assumes a harmonisation fo requirements related to the depository function, and lays out a series of recommendations, including requirements for depository establishments.The association also invites European institutions to bring its requirements for remuneration and depository regimes into line with the requirements laid out in the AIFM directive, which will come into force in July 2013.Andew Baker, CEO of AIMA, says “we feel that the time has come to have a frank discussion about the introduction of a depository passport. Such a passport would provide more competition and choice for managers and investors, and would eliminate a significant barrier to the single market. Without this passport, there is a risk of a lack of competition in the depository sphere, and as a result, an increase in systemic risk.”
