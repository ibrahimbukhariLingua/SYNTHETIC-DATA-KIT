In response to a question asking how they estimate their knowledge of savings and personal finance (retirement, taxes, and various forms of savings) compared with people of the same gender, 26% of women say they have less good knowledge than average, compared with 18% for men. Only 9% of women say they have better than average knowledhe, compared with 23% for men. In saving money, there are differences between men and women also. Women save less, but more often, and take fewer risks in their investments. With respect to the choice of fund, 21% of women choose Swedish equities and diversified funds, while 37% of men prefer Swedish equity funds.
