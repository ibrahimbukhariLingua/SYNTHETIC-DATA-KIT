Jean-François Théodore joins HDF Finance


Jean-François Théodore, former deputy CEO of NYSE Euronext, on 6 May joined the supervisory board at the asset management firm HDF France. In addition to this responsibility, Théodore, who will remain as non-executive director of the stock exchange company, will “assist HDF with regulatory developments,” a statement says. In addition, HDF Finance has announced that it is in the process of recruiting a team member in the United States to replace one US-based departure, Gilles Guérin, at the end of June. The fund manager is also planning to request an SEC license for its US unit. In Switzerland, HDF has also recruited Joseph Steiger, formerly of Credit Suisse and SAM Asset Manaegment, to develop the German-speaking Swiss institutional client base. The Swiss affiliate of the asset management firm now has two offices: one in Geneva, for private banking clients, and one in Zurich. Some funds from the management firm are now in the process of being licensed in the country.
