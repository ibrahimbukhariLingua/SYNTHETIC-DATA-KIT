BlackRock tests appetite for liquid ETFs


BlackRock will on 16 December launch its first European ETF under a new structure which will potentially improve liquidity and reduce costs, Financial News reports. The guinea pig ETF which will test this new structure is the iShares Eurostoxx (Ex-Financials) UCITS ETF, according to sources familiar with the matter. The project at BlackRock is called “Project Fusion.”
