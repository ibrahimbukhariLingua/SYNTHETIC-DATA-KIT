Bill Gross predicts the death of equities


“The cult of equity is dying,” writes Bill Gross, manager of the Pimco Total Return fund, with USD259bn in assets, in his monthly investment outlook for August. He claims that annualised inflation adjusted returns from stocks since 1912 was a phenomenon that can’t possibly be duplicated in the future, in the absence of a “productivity miracle that resembles Apple’s wizardry.” He also warns investors that “almost all” developed economies can be expected to attempt “inflationary solutions” in the next few years and even coming decades.
