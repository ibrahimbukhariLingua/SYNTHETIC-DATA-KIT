UK government to make acquisitions of British firms more difficult


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Takeover Panel in the UK is planning to make the publication of commissions received by bankers and business lawyers compulsory, Les Echos reports. The proposal was published on 21 March in a 172-page document. The proposals are open to consultation until May, after which time the law will be changed, most likely during summer. “Shareholders should receive all the information about the sums spent by businesses in acquisition bids, and consulting commissions represent a significant portion of those amounts,” the Takeover Panel says. Commissions paid by the predator and the target businesses to bankers, lawyers, consultants and communication advisers are included.
