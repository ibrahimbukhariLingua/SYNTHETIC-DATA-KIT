Number of management firms showing annual losses rises sharply


In 2008, which was by all accounts an annus horribilis for the financial markets, the number of French management firms with negative results for the year virtually doubled, from 78 in 2007 to 137 in 2008, the French financial regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) remarks in its report on management for third parties in 2008. Negative results are now a reality for 26.3% of the firms analysed by the regulator. Total operating losses for these firms totalled nearly EUR212m, a rise of 84% compared with 2007. More fragile entrepreneurial management firms represent the majority of firms showing a loss (62%). But their losses remain limited, and total only 27% of total losses of EUR212m. The remainder of the losses (EUR145m) is from portfolio management firms owned by credit establishments. Overall, operating results for portfolio management firms have fallen 34.5% between 2007 and 2008, to EUR2.2bn, though they had risen 13.2% in 2007. Operating margins stand at 18%, 6 points lower than in 2007.
