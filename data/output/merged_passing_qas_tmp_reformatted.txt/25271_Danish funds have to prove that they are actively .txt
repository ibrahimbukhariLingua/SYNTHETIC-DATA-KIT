Danish funds have to prove that they are actively managed


The Danish financial regulator, Finastilsynet, will ask asset management firms selling actively-managed funds, to supply it with two key indicators, active share and tracking error, in order to check that these funds are genuinely actively managed, the Danish newspaper Børsen reports. “When we ask Danish companies, many of them think they have active management, and use this argument to justify relatively high fee levels. We want to check that the activity justifies the fee level,” Julie Galbo told the Danish financial newspaper. According to Børsen, a passive fund costs about DKK6,400 per month, while an actively-managed fund costs two to three times more. But a Morningstar study carried out in Spring found that 37 Danish actively-managed funds claim to be actively managed, and charge commissions as a result, while this is not the case.
