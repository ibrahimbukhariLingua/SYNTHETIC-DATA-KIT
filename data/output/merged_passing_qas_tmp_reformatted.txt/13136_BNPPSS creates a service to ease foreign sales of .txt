BNPPSS creates a service to ease foreign sales of French funds


BNP Paribas Securities Services on Tuesday, 19 July announced that it is launching a “direct orders” service, which will seek to allow its management firm clients to offer investors, including foreign clients, direct access to French OPCVM funds. Under a preliminary agreement between the bank and the management firm, investors may directly place orders with the bank (BNP Paribas Securities Services) as an escrow custodian, and the assets may then be delivered in the form of shares to the client’s custodian in France. “This offering will foster the development of sales of French funds to foreign investors,” a statement says, pointing out that on 30 June 2011, the French market regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) published a modification to its general regulations in the area of escrow custody of financial assets, to allow direct orders, and describing processes related to centralisation of orders and bookkeeping for OPCVM fund releases.
