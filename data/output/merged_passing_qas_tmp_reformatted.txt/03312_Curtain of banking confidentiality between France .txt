Curtain of banking confidentiality between France and Switzerland falls


France and Switzerland on Friday, 12 June signed signed the Franco-Swiss fiscal convention, which ends banking confidentiality and provides for exchanges of information between the tax authorities of the two countries. According to a statement from the French government, discussions between France and Switzerland “resulted in a new draft penned by the administrations of the two states, including an article which complies with the most recent OECD standards, by the terms of which Swiss legislation can no longer present obstacles to the transmission of banking information.” the French tax authorities will thus be able to obtain information, including details of bank accounts, from the Swiss authorities without restriction from 1 January 2010.
