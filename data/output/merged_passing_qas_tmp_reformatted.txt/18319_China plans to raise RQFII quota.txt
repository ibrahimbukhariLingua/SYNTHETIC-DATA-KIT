China plans to raise RQFII quota


The head of the Chinese market watchdog (CSRC), Guo Shuqing, has announced that he is planning to raise the quota reserved for qualified foreign institutional investors in RMB (RQFII) by RMB200bn, or about USD32bn, as the existing quota of RMB70bn is not adequate to meet demand, Asian Investor reports.The action of the CSRC, which has not provided a timetable for the quota increase, represents a favourable response to a request by the Hong Kong authorities.
