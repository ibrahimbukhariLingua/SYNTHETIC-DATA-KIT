Source launches a new optimised ETF


Source on 14 April announced the launch of its new EURO STOXX® Optimised Banks ETF. The product is an addition to its range of 18 optimised European sectoral ETFs from Source, which already represent EUR1.6bn in assets under management, and strong liquidity, with over EUR120bn in volume traded since their launch in June 2009. The new EURO STOXX® Optimised Banks ETF from Source offers exposure to banks of the Euro zone, by replicating the EURO STOXX® Optimised Banks Total Return (net) index. This subindex of the EURO STOXX® index is composed of 24 shares denominated in euros (as the EURO STOXX® index is composed of 312 shares representing companies from the 12 contries of the euro zone, while the Stoxx Europe 600 index is composed of 600 shares from 18 European countries). As for the current optimise sectoral European ETFs from Source, the benchmark index has been optimised in order to reduce exposure to less liquid shares, thus creating a more representative and investable sectoral benchmark index.
