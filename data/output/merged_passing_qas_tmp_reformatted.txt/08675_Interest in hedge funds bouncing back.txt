Interest in hedge funds bouncing back


Fitch Ratings notes that hedge funds appear to be benefiting from renewed interest from institutional investors, who believe they provide better opportunities than those offered by straight equity or credit market investments. Hedge fund inflows turned positive in the second half of 2009 and investor interest has increased, according to asset managers polled by Fitch and data vendors. Alongside traditional funds of hedge funds, where inflows turned positive late last year, and which have improved their liquidity profiles, there is increased demand for segregated mandates. In contrast to the increased demand from institutional investors, demand from private banking, historically the biggest client of European hedge funds, is still being dampened by risk aversion and regulatory uncertainties, notably the Alternative Investment Fund Managers directive. Asset managers are responding to this by launching funds compliant with the UCITS directive.
