Deutsche Bank adds to CROCI range


db-x funds (Deutsche Bank) at the beginning of this week announced the launch of the UCITS-compliant fund DB Platinum CROCI World, which absorbs the CROCI (Cash Return On Capital Invested) strategy of the DB Platinum CROCI World Giants with a more concentrated strategy.From the 450 large international corporations of the MSCI World index, the management team selects the 100 businesses with the lowest adjusted (“economic”) price/earnings ratio; weighting is then undertaken by geographical region and sector, so as to follow the MSCI World index as closely as possible, within a limit of 25% per industry.
