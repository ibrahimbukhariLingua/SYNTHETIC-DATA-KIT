OECD unveils standards for automatic exchange of information


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The OECD on 13 February unveiled its standard model for the exchange of information, a single new global standard for the automatic exchange of data between tax authorities worldwide, which will be presented to G20 finance ministers in 10 daysâ€™ time. Jurisdictions will be required to procure information from their financial institutions and automatically exchange them with other jurisdictions on an annual basis. The standard defines the information to be exchanged, the institutions which will be subject to declaration. The types of account and the taxpayers concerned, and the reasonable diligence procedures to be followed by financial institutions. The OECD will officially present the standard for adoption by the G20 finance ministers at their meeting on 22 and 23 February in Sydney, Australia. In 2013, the G20 invited the OECD to develop a global standard for the automatic exchange of information, and remains the factor driving progress toward the establishment of greater tax transparency worldwide. More than 40 countries have agreed to adopt the standard.
