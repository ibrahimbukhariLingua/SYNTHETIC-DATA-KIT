Hedge fund mortality rate increases


According to the most recent survey by Hedge Fund Research (HFR), the number of hedge fund liquidations, which had consistently diminished over the previous four quarters, increased to 240 in January-March 2010, compared with 165 in October-December 2009. The closures significantly affected funds of hedge funds, with 102 liquidations. Liquidations of funds of hedge funds exceeded the number of launches of new products for the seventh quarter in a row. However, overall, the number of new funds launched was higher than the number of liquidations, at 254. HFR also states that the average leverage rate has continued to fall compared with its level five years ago. More than half of funds have a total leverage rate of 1 to 2, but nearly 30% of funds with more than USD1bn in assets have leverage of over 2. Performance commissions are also tending to fall, insofar as performance is tending to decrease. The average rate of performance commissions fell 8 basis points from the previous quarter, to 19.12%, which represents the largest fall since second quarter 2008, while management commissions remain unchanged at an average of 1.58%. The wide distribution of returns has fallen, with the top 10% of funds posting average returns of 15.2%, and the bottom 10% posting average losses of 8.6%.
