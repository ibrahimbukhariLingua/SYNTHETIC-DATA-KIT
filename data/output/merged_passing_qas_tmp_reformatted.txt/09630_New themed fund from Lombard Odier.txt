New themed fund from Lombard Odier


Lombard Odier has announced the launch of a themed fund, whose objective is to profit from demographic aging trends, entitled LO Funds - Golden Age. The product invests in businesses which are best positioned to respond to this demographic evolution, on the basis of demographic, political, regulatory, economic, and thematic considerations. To achieve this, the management team has assembled a universe of about 300 businesses. “Following primary research, based on participation in medical conferences on the topic of aging, managers have constructed a portfolio of 35 to 60 positions, from among those which will be the most favourably connected to this theme,” the management firm states. Risks are limited to a maximal loss which is defined for each position. The managers of the fund also rely on scientific advising from six internationally renowned specialists from the industrial and academic worlds, who are active in medical technologies, research, and treatment of illnesses related to aging. The fund, which was launched on 16 November 2009, has attracted over EUR100m in investment. Characteristics Name of fund: LO Funds - Golden Age ISIN Codes: in EurosCat. P: LU0161986921; Cat.
