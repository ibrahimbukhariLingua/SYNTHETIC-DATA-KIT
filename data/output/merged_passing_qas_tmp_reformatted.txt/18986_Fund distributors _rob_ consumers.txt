Fund distributors “rob” consumers


European fund distributors are “robbing” retail investors by offering high-priced products even when less costly alternatives are available, Financial Times Fund Management writes. Guillaume Prache, head of the European Federation of Financial Services Users, claims that banks, advisers and fund platforms are more concerned with the commissions they earn from asset management firms than in protecting the interests of clients. He cites the example og ING Direct, which offers French investors a passively-managed tracker fund, the ING Direct CAC 40, managed by Lyxor, with annual fees of 150 basis points, when a virtually identical fund is available for six times less.
