CCR AM bets on international activities as an axis of growth


CCR Asset Management (AM), an affiliate of UBS, is seeking to develop distribution of its products outside the borders of France, Agefi reports. While activities at CCR AM in France showed outflows in 2011 and show more since the beginning of this year, “one of our major axes of development is international. The UBS private bank gives us access to a large global network,” Jean-François Sarlat deputy CEO of CCR AM, explains to Agefi. “The country in which we have developed our distribution so far are countries bordering France, such as Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Spain and Germany,” says Sarlat. “In the future, the emphasis will also be on emerging markets, with the creation of products denominated in foreign currencies,” the director continues.
