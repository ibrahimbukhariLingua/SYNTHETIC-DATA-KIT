Italian AM association writes to minister of the economy


The chairman of Assogestioni, the Italian association of asset management professionals, Giordano Lombardo, has written to the Italian minister of the Economy and Finance, Fabrizio Saccomanni, to share concerns with him concerning the asset management industry with respect to recent government and parliament initiatives in the area of taxation, which may penalise Italian savers. Lombardo points the finger in particular at proposals to modify a law on the financial transactions tax, “which affects savers who have invesed in Italian-registered funds, and runs the risk of seriously endangering the Italian investment fund sector.”
