Bond ETFs carry hidden risks


In the “Fund Track” column of the Wall Street Journal, Matt Hougan, managing director of ETF analytics at Index Publications, warns investors against bond ETFs. He points out that there is an inherent flaw in ETFs which are not focused on Treasuries: the corporate bond market is notoriously illiquid. And, since ETFs need liquidity, that flaw is magnified. David Levy, a portfolio manager at Keniol Capital Management, says investors should be careful, if they have already bought shares in ETFs at a premium, not to choose a bad time to resell them at a discount.
