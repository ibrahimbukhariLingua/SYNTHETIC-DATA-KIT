S&amp;P cuts ratings for AllianceBernstein


The ratings agency Standard & Poorâ€™s (S&P) on Friday announced that it is lowering the long-term and short-term ratings for AllianceBernstein (USD400bn as of the end of May) to A+ and A-1, respectively, from AA- and A-1+, with a negative outlook.The ratings downgrade is due partly to ongoing net redemptions, which have reduced operating revenues, and on the other hand to distortion of portfolios, with bond assets representing more than half of the total, so that they would be at risk if debt markets were to deteriorate. The negative outlook is due to the disappointing performance of large cap products, which may lead to a continuation of outflows.However, S&P recognizes that the financial risk profile of AllianceBernstein is healthy.
