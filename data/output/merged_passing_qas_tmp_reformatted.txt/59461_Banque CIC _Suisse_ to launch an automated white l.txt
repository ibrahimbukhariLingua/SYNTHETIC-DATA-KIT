Banque CIC (Suisse) to launch an automated white label investment platform


Banque CIC (Suisse) is currently developing a new white label platform in partnership with the digital specialist ti&m, which will allow clients to determine their allocation. The platform, which will be entitled “clevercircles” and will be launched in early 2018, will rely on the advantages of robo-advisers, and will offer investors a way to determine their investment strategy and steer tactical management of their allocations. To assist with decisions and market outlooks, clevercircles offers a way to form an opinion with selected individuals or groups and/or with the financial community (“social forecasting.”)clevercircles will also be available in a white label version. Under the name “crowd advice,” B2B solutions will be offered, with the participation of ti&m not only to serve banks, but also insurers, independent asset management firms and other financial services providers.
