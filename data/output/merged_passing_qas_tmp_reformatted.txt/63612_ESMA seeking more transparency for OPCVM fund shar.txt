ESMA seeking more transparency for OPCVM fund shares


The European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) is proposing greater transparency and greater consistency in the categories of shares offered for a single fund, in an opinion paper published on 30 january. The document released by ESMA lays out four major principles to follow in the implementation of various categories of shares in a UCITS fund to promote a “harmonized approach” in the various countries of the European Union.The first principle is a shared investment objective. Categories of shares in a single OPCVM fund must have a single investment objective which applied to all assets in common. ESMA considers in particular that the hedging structures for share classes, with the exception of hedgeing for currency risks, are not compatible with the requirement that a fund must have a shared objective.A second point advanced by ESMA is that asset management firms must set up appropriate procedures to minimise the risk of contagion, meaning any characteristics specific to a share class which may have a negative impact on other share classes in the same fund. A third poiint is that all of the characteristics of a share class must be predefined before the creation of the fund. Lastly, the differences between share classes in a single fund must be communicated to investors when they have a choice of investing in at least two share classes.ESMA states that share classes which do not respect these principles must be retained as is but closed to new investors within six months following the publication of the opinion paper, and closed to existing investors within 18 months.
