P2 Value fund brings discredit to real estate funds


The P2 Value fund from the German management firm Morgan Stanley Real Estate is the only German open-ended real estate fund to have been closed since the end of October 2008 without interruption, meaning that subscribers are prisoners in a fund which has been devalued three times in one year. If the manager cannot get together enough liquidty by the end of October 2010, BaFin may require the management firm to liquidate the fund within one year, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung writes. The P2 Value fundâ€™s misfortunes throw the entire real estate fund industry into disrepute at an unfortunate time: ten real estate funds currently have their redemptions suspended, with total assets of EUR25.5bn, equivalent to 28.7% of total assets in the sector, and the P2 Value fund will probably not remain an isolated case.
