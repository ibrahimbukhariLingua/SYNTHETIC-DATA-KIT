Former HSBC IT specialist released on bail


Herv√© Falciani, the former IT employee of HSBC Geneva accused of stealing bank data which was obtained by the French tax authorities, whose extradition is being sought by Switzerland, has been released on bail, a Spanish judge announced on 18 December. No verdict has been announced so far on his potential extradition.The Spanish national court heard arguments from the defence and the public prosecution, which sought bail due to the fact that examination of the extradition request will not be completed quickly, as other documents are required, according to the verdict of the judge.Switzerland issued an international arrest warrant against Falciani following the theft of confidential bank data from the Geneva affiliate of HSBC bank, which was then used by the French fiscal authorities. Following his arrest in Spain in early July, Switzerland issued an extradition application to the Spanish justice ministry on 5 July.
