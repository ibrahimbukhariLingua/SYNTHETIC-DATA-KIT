AIFM directive viewed as a threat to asset managers


Nearly three quarters (72%) of fund managers consider the AIFM directive a threat to their activities, according to a survey by Deloitte. The most often cited threats are costs related to depository functions (84%), management outsourcing (78%), modifications to contractual arrangements, and access to the market (67%). The asset management firms which consider the AIFM directive an opportunity generally have at least GBP1bn in assets under management. Smaller firms estimate that the directive instead runs the risk of penalising their activities. The survey also finds that the AIFM directive will favour improvements in transparency. More than 50% of respondents to the survey say that they are planning to offer additional information to investors to comply with the terms of the reporting directive.
