United States - Hopes fade of recovering assets invested with Stanford


Ralph Janvey, the administrator designated to liquidate the assets of Sir Allen Stanford, announced on Monday that he would probably only recuperate a few hundreds of millions of US dollars for investors, instead of the billions which he had originally hoped to recover, due to the ?appalling? condition of the financial empire built by the Texan businessman, the Financial Times reports. The announcement comes as a Federal judge has extended a freeze on Stanford investors’ accounts for a further 10 days.
