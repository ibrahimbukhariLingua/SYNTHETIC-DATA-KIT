Newton practices integrated SRI for all of its product range


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Matthieu Duncan, head of business strategy at Newton Investment Management (GBP47.2bn), has told Newsmanagers in an interview at the Forum GI that the London-based boutique from BNY Mellon absolutely does not practice socially responsible investment (SRI) as a separate entity from extra-financial analysis, which is handled by three specialised managers (out of a total of 25), who also rely on research from EIRIS, and who are an integral part of the stock-picking process, which may also be a part of the reason that the management firm relies on a range of charitable organisations as clients (GBP4.5bn in dedicated mandates for 500 clients), and a team of 15 managers.SRI is, more precisely, part of Newton’s DNA, and was present when the firm was founded in 1998. The management firm has also more recently also introduced environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into the investment process. It has also been supplemented with an active “engagement” policy and a variety of reporting and transparency as to the nature of activities.Half of total assets at Newton, a business with 400 employees, come from institutional mandates (250 clients), many of them for pension funds. One third of assets under management are held in thirty British-registered OEIC products, and less than 10 Irish-registered UCITS-compliant funds. The remainder of assets are from charities and private clients.
