Philippines market gradually opening


After expanding by more than 40% in 2012, growth momentum in the Philippinesâ€™ retail fund industry continued into 2013, according to Cerulli. By the end of June, assets under management (AUM) in unit investment trust funds (UITFs) had reached PHP385 billion (US$8.9 billion), while AUM of mutual funds had breached PHP200 billion for the first time. Cerulli Associates believes that the Philippine retail fund industry is still in its infancy and remains restricted, not helped by bouts of regulatory inertia. However, there have been some positive leads. For instance, the Philippine Stock Exchange is now accepting listing applications for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) following approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission on the final component of ETF guidelines, paving the way for their longawaited debut. In the UITF segment, feeder funds and funds of funds (FoFs) received the green light from Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in September last year. On the institutional side, the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) is currently considering relocating assets abroad. Also, although the Social Security System (SSS) has always been managing its assets-which are 100% local-in-house, moving toward foreign investment is necessary due to limited market capitalization in the Philippines. As such, advisory services will be needed, and mandates are likely to be handed out to foreign managers.
