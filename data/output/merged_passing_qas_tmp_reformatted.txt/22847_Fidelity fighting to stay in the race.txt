Fidelity fighting to stay in the race


Several signs are indicating that Fidelity Worldwide Investment needs to pedal harder than most other actors in the sector in order to retain its even keel, a Financial Times article on the firm claims. The newspaper cites a downgrade in the firm’s credit rating by Standard & Poor’s, the departure of several members of management, a decline in assets and negative performance of funds, among other factors. In 2006, Fidelity Worldwide had USD300bn in assets under management, and consultants praised the stability of the group, the FT reports. The same year, management was aiming for USD500bn in assets in five years’ time, and USD1trn in 10 years. In 2008, assets fell to USD150bn.
