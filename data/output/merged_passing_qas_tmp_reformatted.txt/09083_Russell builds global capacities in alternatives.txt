Russell builds global capacities in alternatives


To strengthen its presence in the area of “less traditional” strategies such as active management of commodities, investments in private equity and high-alpha strategies, Russell Investments is adding to its manager selection and advising services worldwide. To this end, the firm is planning to recruit more than 25 specialists in Australia, Japan, Europe, and the Americas. The recruitments will include senior consultants, senior investment strategists, and manager research analysts.
