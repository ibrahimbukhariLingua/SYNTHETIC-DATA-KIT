Efama welcomes preliminary agreement on cross-border fund distribution


European asset management association Efama has welcomed the preliminary agreement in trilogue on the proposal on facilitating cross-border distribution of funds, foundbetween the Romanian Presidency and the European Parliament. In a statement,Efama’s director general Tanguy van de Werve said: “We will be reviewing the details of the preliminary agreement once they are made public. There may be aspects which we hope will still be appropriately addressed in technical trilogue meetings. However – and subject to confirmation- we do very much welcome that the agreement includes calling for an extension of two years (until December 2021) of the UCITS exemption in the PRIIPs Regulation. This is an acknowledgement that the current flaws of the PRIIPs KID, including the presentation of performance and transaction cost methodologies, need to be corrected appropriately, and is by far the best outcome from an investor protection perspective”. In addition, EFAMA also welcomes the removal of numerical thresholds governing the de-notification of funds in host EU jurisdictions, «where these risked building up new barriers to cross-border distribution behind wrongly held investor protection concerns.»
