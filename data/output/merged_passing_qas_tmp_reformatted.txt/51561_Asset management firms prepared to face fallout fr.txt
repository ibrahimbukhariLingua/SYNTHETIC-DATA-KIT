Asset management firms prepared to face fallout from Brexit


The volatility of the markets since the beginning of the year, including volatility related to the fallout from the British referendum, represents an additional challenge for asset management firms in the United States and Europe, the financial ratings agency Fitch Ratings estimates in notes dedicated to the United States and the United Kingdom.A decline in performance observed in the past six months comes in addition to more long-term challenges, including a rise in the popularity of passive investment strategies, and reduced liquidity on the secondary market for some asset classes. However, the agency continues to estimate that ratings of asset management firms are supported by a diversity of assets under management in terms of products and geographical regions. The agency also cites low levels of leverage and high margins related to economies of scale and variable cost structures.“The immediate impact of Brexit has exacerbated volatility in the price of assets for many asset classes, and although most major US asset management firms are only moderately exposed to the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region in terms of assets under management, uncertainties surrounding the European passport may lead to significant relocation costs for offices and teams,” says Nathan Flanders, managing director at Fitch Ratings New York, cited in a statement.In Europe, the British firms Schroders plc (A+/stable), Aberdeen Asset Management plc (A/Stable) and Man Strategic Holdings Limited (BBB+/Stable) are well-positioned to confront the fallout from Brexit in the short term, but may be more vulnerable in the long term if access to the single European market is limited. But in this case also, Fitch indicates that all British publicly-traded asset management firms have adequate size and diversification to deal with potential restrictions on the European market.
