BNP Paribas SS wins a mandate from Convictions AM


Convictions Asset Management has awarded an execution mandate for fixed income transactions to BNP Paribas Securities Services. Convictions AM, whose assets under management currently total about EUR630m, would like its portfolio managers to concentrate on analysis, research and allocation of investments, in order to adapt to difficult market conditions. The asset management firm has chosen BNP Paribas SS, which already held a five-year outsourcing mandate for middle and back office functions. The outsourcing of front office functions is a new trend in the asset management sector, with Convictions AM one of the first exemplars.
