Three out of four hedge fund strategies in the red in June


According to Edhec, hedge fund indexes in June varied from a loss of 1.53% for futures funds (CTA global) to positive returns of 2.62% for convertibles arbitrage. Two other strategies showed losses: dedicated short bias (-0.84%), and global macro (-0.68%). Since the beginning of the year, two of the 13 categories monitored by Edhec show negative results: dedicated short bias (-7.7%) and CTA Global (-3.1%). The best returns have been for convertibles arbitrage (24.4%), and emerging markets (17.7%). Edhec states that, since January 2001, all strategies are showing returns that vary from an annualised average of 4% for funds of hedge funds to 11.2% for emerging markets. The latter category also has the second highest standard deviation, at 10.9%, after dedicated short bias (14%).
