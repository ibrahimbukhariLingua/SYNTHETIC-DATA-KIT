Assets rebound for four US asset management firms in April


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } After several months of declines in assets, the four tenors of US asset management have returned to growth in April. The strongest rebound came at Legg Mason, which, month over month, has posted growth in its assets under management of 5.3%, to USD707.1bn as of the end of April 2016. The asset management firm has seen USD2.5bn in net outflows from bonds. Meanwhile, equity funds have seen USD1.4bn in net redemptions, while alternative products have posted USD1.1bn in net outflows. Liquidity products showed USD6.7bn in net outflows in April. Legg Mason was, however, able to benefit from a positive currency effect of about EUR2.6bn, and most of all from a contribution of USD41.5bn in assets from Clarion Partners, acquired on 13 April 2016. Invesco has seen an increase of 1.6% to its asets, to USD783.7bn. This increase was also driven by positive currency effects totalling USD3.2bn. The 100% takeover of its Indian joint venture with Religare Enterprises Limited has allowed the firm to increase its assets by about USD2.4bn. Invesco gave no details, however, about inflows over the past month. AllianceBernstein (AB) and Franklin Templeton have also returned to growth, but to a lesser extent than their rivals. AB has posted an increase in its assets of only 0.8% to USD483bn as of the end of April 2016. This increase is related “to a positive currency effect, partly offset by a net outflow,” AB has announced, without releasing figures. Franklin Templeton has seen an increase in its assets of 0.6% to USD747.1bn as of the end of April 2016. The asset management firm offered no explanations for this monthly growth.
