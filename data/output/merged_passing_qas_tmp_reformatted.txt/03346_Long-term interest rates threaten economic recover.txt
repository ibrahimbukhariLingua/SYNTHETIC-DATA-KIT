Long-term interest rates threaten economic recovery


Central banks face a real headache, as rising returns on government bonds on both sides of the Atlantic may undermine a potentially sustainable economic recovery, La Tribune reports. Despite strategies employed by the Fed and the Bank of England to attempt to confront this, tension is increasing, particularly in the past three months. The newspaper points out that returns on US ten-year government bonds has risen from 2.20% at the beginning of the year to 3.92% yesterday. German bunds with the same maturity have risen from 2.89% to 3.725. And now movements on the part of creditors are there to contend with. After China at the end of last week, Russia is now planning to reduce the presence of US government bonds in its currency reserves by Usd401bn, in favour of bonds issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) come close to caching up, La Tribune reports, the offensive against Uncle Sam is gaining momentum. The spectre of the inflationary monster, in the wake of massive recovery programs in Europe and the United States, and the borrowing needs of the public sector in the most economically powerful countries on the planet contribute to this problem. La Tribune estimates that Europe is better immunized against these threats than the United States, where returns on ten-year US Treasury bonds are still higher than those in Germany.
