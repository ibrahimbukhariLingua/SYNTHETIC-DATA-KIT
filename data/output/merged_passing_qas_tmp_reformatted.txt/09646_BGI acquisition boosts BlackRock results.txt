BGI acquisition boosts BlackRock results


BlackRock earned net profits in fourth quarter of USD256m, compared with profits og USD52m one year previously. The cause of this quintupling of the quarterly results was the acquisition of Barclays Global Investors (BGI), completed on 1 December, which contributed USD94m to net profits, and the continuation of growth in activities which had already been observed in third quarter (profits were already up 46%) due to a more favourable environment on the markets. For 2009 as a whole, BlackRock shows net profits of USD1.02bn, a 19% increase over the previous year. In fourth quarter, assets under management rose from USD1.4trn to USD3.3trn, largely thanks to the addition of BGI, but also due to net inflows of USD82bn in the period (including slightly over USD49bn from institutionals). For the year as a whole, net inflows totalled USD156bn, due to net subscriptions of USD200bn for long-term products, and USD11.6bn in advising mandates. These positive factors were offset by USD56bnin net outflows from money market funds.
