Aberdeen European Balanced Property Fund tops EUR500m


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Aberdeen European Balanced Property Fund, which has been licensed for sale in France, has topped EUR500m in assets, Gert-Jan Kapitean, manager of the fund, has told Newsmanagers. With transaction projects in progress, the fund may reach EUR600m during summer. “We have an intermediate asset objective of about EUR1bn, due to stronger interest from consultants in strategies which reach this level,” Kapitean says. This objective does not seem far off, to the extent that the outlooks for the European real estate market are positive from Kapitean’s viewpoint. After growth of 27% in 2014, investment volume in the European market may rise by another 20% this year. In this context, the fund has many transactions in the pipeline. Afrer a shopping centre in Finland, an investment of over EUR42m, the fund is at work on an investment in Belgium for a total of about EUR64m. The fund, currently present in all of the major markets of continental Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, Finland), is now taking an interest in the Spanish market.
