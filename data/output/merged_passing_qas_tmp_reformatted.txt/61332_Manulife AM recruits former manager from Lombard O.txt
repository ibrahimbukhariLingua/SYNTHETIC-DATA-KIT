Manulife AM recruits former manager from Lombard Odier IM


Grant Peterkin, a former manager from Lombard Odier Investment Managers (Lombard Odier IM), joined Manulife Asset Management in early May as senior managing director and senior portfolio manager, according to his LinkedIn profile. Peterkin, who had managed a portfolio of absolute return bonds at Lombard Odier IM, left the Geneva-based bank in March 2017, at the same time as his colleagues, Gregor Macintosh and Federico Belak. He joined Lombard Odier IM in March 2013 from Ignis Asset Management, where he spent two years. According to Citywire Selector, which broke the story, Peterkin is joining the team dedicated to liquid alternative strategies at Manulife AM, under the suppervision of Chris Fellingham, recruited last year as head of liquid alternative strategies. The two managers know each other well, as they worked together at Ignis Asset Management, a firm which has since been acquired by Standard Life Investments.
