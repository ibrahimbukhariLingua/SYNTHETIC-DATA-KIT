BP up against institutionals in shareholders’ meeting


For the oil giant BP, the general shareholders’ meeting to be held on 14 April in London will be a challenge. Two of the largest US pension funds, CalPERS and SBA (Florida State Board of Administration) have announced that they will not vote to approve the group’s accounts due to a lack of reactivity on environmental and security issues in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico oil leak. The decisions, reported by Responsible Investor, follow an announcement last week by a group of US and European institutional investors not to vote to approve BP’s books. CalPERS points to the lack of information in the firm’s annual reports about “key performance indicators and the reevaluation of the role of the board of directors in overseeing risk management.”
