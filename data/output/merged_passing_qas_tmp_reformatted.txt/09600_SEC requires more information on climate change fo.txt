SEC requires more information on climate change footprint of businesses


On Wednesday, SEC commissioners voted three to two to pass a requirement that publicly-traded businesses provide more information about their impact on climate change. The Wall Street Journal reports that the new rules will be good news for investors and for well-governed companies. Matthew W. Patsky, CEO of Trillium Asset Management Corp, says the regulations will make it easier to value all businesses, some of which do not have as much of an established track record as may be imagined. John Wilson, head of corporate governance at the pension fund TIAA-CREF, shares this opinion.
