Cautious investors seek middle ground


The penultimate week of 3Q14 saw investors sticking to the conservative script they have followed since August as they wait for answers to a range of unsettling questions. Will the end of the US Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing program next month deal a bigger than expected blow to a slowing global economy? What direction will Europe’s standoff with Russia take as the Northern Hemisphere winter approaches? Are Chinese policymakers flirting with a hard landing for the world’s second largest economy? Can ‘Abenomics’ – and the Japanese economy – rebound from the setbacks triggered by April’s sales tax hike?In the face of these and other questions investors continued to reduce their exposure to Western Europe, most emerging markets, Japan and China during the week ending September 24, steering their money instead into Money Market Funds and fixed income fund groups with multi-asset or total return mandates.Overall, EPFR Global-tracked Equity Funds posted collective inflows of $1.06 billion and Bond Funds took in a net $3.78 billion while Money Market Funds absorbed $20.75 billion.
