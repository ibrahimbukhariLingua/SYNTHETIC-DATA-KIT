Family offices prefer wealth management in Switzerland


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } The Swiss financial market is continuing to benefit from the preferences of Famiy Offices in the area of wealth management, Agefi Switzerland reports. Although Luxembourg is also favoured by some, emerging financial centres such as Singapore are still playing a minor role in this area, the most recent edition of the study of family offices carried out for Complementa Investment Controlling, with the cooperation of KPMG and others, reveals. “Family offices are generally oriented to the long-term and are relatively little influenced by current developments,” Wolfgang Gerke, co-author of the study and chairman of the Bavarian finance centre, explained at a conference in Zurich. The possible reasons for a move in wealth management might include protection from regulatory intrusion, obtaining increased legal security, and ensuring greater discretion. But the heads of family offices surveyed are far from considering such changes in the management of their wealth.
