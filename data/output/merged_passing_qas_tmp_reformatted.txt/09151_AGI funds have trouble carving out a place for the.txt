AGI funds have trouble carving out a place for themselves on Commerzbank network


Allianz Global Investors (AGI) may be the largest management firm in Germany, with EUR248.4bn in assets, but it is only the fourth-largest management firm for open-ended retail funds, the most lucrative category, with EUR79.1bn, Handelsblatt reports. Since Allianz sold Dresdner Bank to Commerzbank, AGI has lost its captive distribution network, as Commerzbank practices open architecture. Its advisors are required to recommend the best funds - which are currently often products from Carmignac, James Dilworth, CEO of AGI Deutschland, admits. AGI is now seeking to set up joint products with Commerzbank. Dilworth admits that some distribution partners saw negative results last year. He will not say which ones, but sources familiar with the matter say that Allianz may be one of them.
