Siparex leads investors pool to acquire Missler Software


The management team at the Missler Software group, led by Richard Lamure, is turning to a pool of financial investors led by Siparex, and including Bpifrance and IRDI, to take over the group. The operation will result in the partial exit of the three 2005 acquirers of Missler Software, including the creators of the TopSolid software package, and the exit of the financial stakeholder iXO Private Equity. Missler Software, founded in 1984, is a global leader in computer-assisted design and computer-assisted manuacturing (CAD-CAM) with the TopSolid suite. The range of proprietary software offers an integrated solution for the digitally-controlled design and manufacture of technical machine parts and professional application modules (wood casing, sheet metal, etc.) On the back of a successful career since an operation to reconfigure capital in 2015, the management team at Missler Software plans to turn to the pool of investors led by Siparex to assist the group to accelerate its growth. Richard Lamure, Philippe Julliard, Patrice Tiberi and Jean-Louis Jammot will continue to conquer market share internationally by extending the distribution network and growing international affiliates. They also hope to implement an external growth strategy in the fragmented software publishing and distribution industry.
