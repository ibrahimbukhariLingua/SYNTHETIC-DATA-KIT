p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } The Norwegian sovereign fund, Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), is reported to have informed Bestinver of its decision to end a mandate, under which the Spanish asset management firm had provided management of the fund’s investments in Spain, with a total of EUR400m in assets under management, the newspaper Expansion reports in its printed edition. The decision comes following the departure of the emblematic Bestinver manager Francisco Garcia Paramés, who has since been replaced by Beltran de la Lastra. The news comes at a time when the Spanish asset management firm is reported to have undergone redemptions of over EUR1bn in the past few weeks, equivalent to 15% of its overall assets, according to the most recent figures from Morningstar.
