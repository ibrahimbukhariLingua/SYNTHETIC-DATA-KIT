Neuflize OBCI launches a global dividend fund


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Neuflize OBC Invetissements is this morning expected to announce the launch of Neuflize Monde Dividendes, a fund composed of international equities managed with the theme of international high-dividend equities. The asset management firm plans to take advantage of the context of low growth and “financial repression” which has been driving investors to seek new sources of returns, not least from corporate dividends. Neuflize Monde Dividendes has a minimal exposure to equities of 60%. It aims to invest in a selecftion of equities listed on a universe of international equities from OECD countries (Europe, North America, Japan, Australia), including OECD member emerging countries (Mexico, Turkey, eastern Europe, South Korea, etc.) The geographical and sectoral allocation of the fund is discretionary and depends on the anticipations and convictions of mangement. Selection is focused on equities which offer high, stable or growing dividends. The selection process is composed of two stages: the fisrt aims to identify equities which distribute recurrent dividends which rise over the long term, through the implementation of a systematic quantitative screening of a very broad universe of nearly 3,000 stocks. The second step is to check the quantitative screening with a qualitative analysis which is based on a more in-depth financial study of the shares.
