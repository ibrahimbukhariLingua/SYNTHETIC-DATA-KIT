Coutts fined GBP6.3m


The British Financial Services Authority (FSA) on 8 November announced that it has fined Coutts, the wealth management affiliate of RBS, GBP6.3m, for non-compliance with regulations in the sale of a fund from AIG.Between 3 December 2003 and 15 September 2008, Coutts sold the fund to 427 high net worth clients, for a cumulative GBP1.45bn, The money market fund was, of course, invested in money market instruments, but unlike traditional money market funds, it also sought to improve its performance by dedicating a significant percentage of its assets to ABS and floating rate notes.When the financial crisis broke out in 2007 and 2008, the market value of some of the assets in the fund fell below its book value. Many investors wanted to withdraw from the fund following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, even though the fund had suspended payments. Due to a crying information deficit, both on the part of advisers and the documentation provided, Coutts clients were exposed to “unacceptable risk,” the FSA says in a statement.The fine was nonetheless reduced by 30%, due to the active cooperation of Coutts with the FSA to settle the problem.
