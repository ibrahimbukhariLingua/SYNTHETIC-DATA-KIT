UK investment boutique J O Hambro Capital Management (JOHCM) has acquired Silver Metis Capital Management, a Singapore based asset management boutique specialising in Asian equities that was founded in 2007 by Samir Mehta. The latter will join the UK asset manager, with Cho-Yu Kooi, in advance of the launch of two Asia ex Japan equity funds in late September. Samir Mehta’s new fund will offer a concentrated, all cap approach managed with a long-term return philosophy. Cho-Yu Kooi will manage a small/mid-cap fund with a similar philosophy. Both strategies will also be available to institutional investors on a segregated account basis.Samir Mehta and Cho-Yu Kooi will be based in Singapore where they will be assisted by dedicated analyst and trading support. The Singapore office will become an important location to support JOHCM’s Global Equities and Emerging Markets Equities teams, complement the London-based dealing capability in Asian markets and enhance sales and client servicing in the region.
