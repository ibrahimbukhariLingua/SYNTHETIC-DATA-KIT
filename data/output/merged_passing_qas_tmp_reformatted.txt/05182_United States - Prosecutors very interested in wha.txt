United States - Prosecutors very interested in what Frank DiPascali Jr? will say


Frank DiPascali Jr was the closest lieutenant to Bernard Madoff for more than thirty years. He was the head of trading for equities options, and the point man for investment-advisory clients, who were told he executed their trades, the Wall Street Journal reports. He is now a potential point man for the fraud investigation into Bernard Madoff - but he himself is not named as a suspect, whereas Madoff is facing criminal charges for securities fraud, and claims that he acted alone.
