Germany - Goldman Sachs AM has high ambitions


Axel Hörger, head of Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) for Germany and continental Europe, is aiming for assets of EUR30-40bn in Germany in the long term. This is an ambitious goal, since, as Handelsblatt observes, the first step will be to regain a level of EUR18bn in assets, their peak before the crisis. Assets have now fallen below EUR10bn (institutional investors withdrew a net total of EUR2.2bn in 2008). GSAM has cut staff and closed its German-registered KAG format management firm. Hörger says there is now rising demand for simple and transparent products. GSAM is now planning to focus on funds for private clients via banks and insurance firms. This will mean some recruitments: soon, nearly one third of the firm’s 29 staff will be dedicated to this activity.
