Fewer than one out of 10 managers in Denmark is a woman


Only 9% of Danish asset management firms have women employed in portfolio management, according to a survey of FW Asset Management of 35 local asset management firms. Among those who have women on their staff, women represent an average of only 9% of the total number of managers employed by the firm. The Danish pension fund ATP has the highest percentage of women managers. 18% of its managers are women, four out of 22. Most Danish asset management firms surveyed say they would like to recruit women managers but that they receive no applications from women. Several observe that they employ many women in other departments, including legal and human resources.
