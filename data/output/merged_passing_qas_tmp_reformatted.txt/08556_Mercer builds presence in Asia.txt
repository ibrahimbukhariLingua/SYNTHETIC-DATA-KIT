Mercer builds presence in Asia


The consulting firm Mercer is continuing to scale up its presence in Asia, with the deployment of a team dedicated to wealth management in Singapore, which will be led by Hansi Mehrotra, who will move from Sydney to Singapore at the end of June. Mehrotra joined Mercer in October 2003 to set up wealth management services for the Australian market. She will retain her positions as head of wealth management services for the Asia-Pacific region and head of advising for the Indian market. Asian Investor reports that Mehotra will work with Desmond Lee, who joined Mercer this week as wealth management consultant. Lee was previously at DBS Asset Management, where he was head of structured management and advising for high net worth clients. Mercer is also planning further recruitments in Singapore.
