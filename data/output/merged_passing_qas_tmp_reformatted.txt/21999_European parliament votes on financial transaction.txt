European parliament votes on financial transaction tax


The European parliament on 23 May approved a large majority of the proposed outlines of a tax on financial transactions, even as memner states remain divided over the principle. The tax of 0.1% on equities and bonds and 0.01% on derivative products aims to regulate markets while bringing revenues into government coffers. The European Commission on 28 September unveiled its tax proposals, from which currency markets are excluded, which it claims could bring in EUR55bn by 2014. “I think this tax should be an integral part of the European Union’s exit strategy from the crisis,” said Dutch social democrat MEP Anni Podimata, reporter for the Parliament’s proposal on the subject. The proposal, which is supported by France and Germany, is opposed by countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Malta and the Czech Republic. MEPs, who have only a consulting role in the matter, have supported the proposals by a vote of 487 in favour, 152 against, and 46 amendments, in a sign of consensus between the major left- and right-wing political groups. MEPs voted in favour of amendments which would exempt pension funds from the tax, but would extend the eligibility criteria to include other financial actors. Financial sector businesses in member states would be subject to the tax, as would be firms which participate in a transaction involving “a financial instrument issued by a legal entity incorporated in the Union.”
