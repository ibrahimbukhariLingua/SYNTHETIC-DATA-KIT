BNY Mellon IM sees decline in assets in Scandinavian countries


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } In only two years, the Northern Europe division of BNY Mellon has lost 28.6% of its assets under management, from USD7bn to USD5bn currently, the Danish website FW Asset Management reports. The US group attributes the decline to a trend toward insourcing of managemment by pension funds, closer attention to costs, and competition from ETFs. Pressure on costs is particularly strong in Northern Europe, where there is more competition and more transparency. «Compared to the international market, we focus more on expenses in the Nordics. In certain parts of Europe, a pension fund is willing to pay 75 basis points for an investment product, while in the Nordics, the same thing would go for 39-41 basis points», explains Jens Steen, head of Nordic Investment Management for BNY Mellon.
