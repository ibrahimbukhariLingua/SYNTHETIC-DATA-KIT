Jim Rogers bets against US dollars and Tresuries


The star manager Jim Rogers has stated that his allocation to the US dollar is currently lower than one year ago, he has not bought any US equities since the beginning of the year, and he is planning to short-sell Treasury bonds, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. He says the increasing debt of the United States is sapping confidence in the dollar. He has bought Swiss francs, and also has positions on Japanese yen, Singapore dollars, Yuan, and Australian and New Zealand dollars.
