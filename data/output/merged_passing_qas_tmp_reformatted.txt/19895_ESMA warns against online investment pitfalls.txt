ESMA warns against online investment pitfalls


In a document published in 21 languages, the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) has issued a warning to retail investors against the pitfalls of online investment over the Internet.ESMA finds that “sometimes high pressure and aggressive selling/marketing techniques are used to entice (...) to invest, or to use particular websites,” and that “Not all firms operating on the internet have permission to offer investments.” Additionally, the agency says, “ESMA, and the authorities in Member States, have observed an increase in investor complaints regarding unauthorised activities by firms on the internet. Although financial regulations apply to advertising, not all the advertising you see complies with these. For example, there may be no, or little, investor information; and sometimes the information provided is misleading.” ESMA’s key messages in the 4-page release are:•Be aware of the potential risks involved in online investing.•Check if the firm is authorised.•Be wary of promises of high returns.•Be aware of software that automatically generates transactions for you.•Take special care when you’re asked to provide your credit card details.•If you do not understand what’s on offer, do not invest.
