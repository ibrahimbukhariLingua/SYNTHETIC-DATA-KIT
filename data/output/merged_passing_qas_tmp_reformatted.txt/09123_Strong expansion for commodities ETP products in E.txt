Between the end of 2008 and 5 March 2010, assets in exchange-traded products based on commodities (C-ETP) in Europe increased from EUR8.6bn to EUR23.1bn. Assets under management in commodities ETC funds increased to EUR11.5bn, compared with EUR4.9bn, while commodities ETF funds had EUR11.6bn, compared with EUR3.7bn, according to a study by Deutsche Bank. In 2009, assets in C-ETP rose 145%, and specialists at the bank predict that in 2010, growth will total 60%-80%. The big winners in terms of subscriptions this year are expected to be products focused on industrial commodities and those which replicate larger indices, while Swiss gold funds may also continue to grow. In the period under review (end of December 2008 to 5 March 2010), the number of commodity ETC products increased by 56 to a total of 179, while the number of commodities ETFs increased by 33 to 75 products.
