SEC plans to more closely monitor investment advisers


SEC commissioners on 19 November adopted a proposal by four votes which tighten sthe regulatory framework for hedge funds and venture capital funds, a proposal (http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-228.htm) which is now open for a market consultation for a period of 45 days. It is the regulatorâ€™s interpretation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.Requirements to register with the SEC will be imposed on all funds, including private equity funds which were exonerated by the Dodd-Frank law, with assets of over USD100m (up from USD25m previously); in addition, the proposal eliminates the exemption which had applied to hedge funds. All investment advisors will be required to provide information to the regulatory about assets, investors, their auditor, their brokers, and other service providers.Funds which become subject to the registration requirement will be required to appoint a head of compliance, establish a code of compliance, and to undergo inspections by SEC personnel.This will also for the first time permit a clear survey of the sector, the regulator says.
