Euro zone crisis worries investors


Investors continued their search for safer places to park their money going into June as Spain struggled to avoid becoming the latest Eurozone market to require bailing out and economic data in the US continues to disappoint. Flows into EPFR Global-tracked US Money Market Funds during the week ending May 30 jumped to a 25 week high while US Bond Funds took in over USD1.5 billion for the 24th week in a row and Gold Funds recorded their biggest inflow since late January while Europe and Emerging Market Equity Funds extended their current outflow streaks.Despite the souring mood in global financial markets, Equity Funds managed to post net inflows of USD6.2 billion. But this was all due to flows into US Equity Funds and half of the total inflows were into a single S&P 500 index fund. While Monday inflows were strong, flows into the equity funds were dissipating at midweek. Bond Fund inflows amounted to USD1.5 billion while Money Market Funds took in a net USD2.2 billion as the flows into US funds were largely offset by redemptions from Europe Money Market Funds that hit an eight week high of USD7.6 billion.Nonetheless, «redemptions still haven’t hit the levels seen last August,» noted EPFR Global Research Director Cameron Brandt. «That may be due in part to the fact that flows are currently dominated by institutional investors. The retail investors who fled during 3Q11 have stayed away.»
