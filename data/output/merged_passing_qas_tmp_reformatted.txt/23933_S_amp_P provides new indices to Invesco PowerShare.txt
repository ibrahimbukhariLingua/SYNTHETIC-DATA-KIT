S&amp;P provides new indices to Invesco PowerShares


The index provider S&P Indices on 23 February announced a new addition to its “high beta” family of indices, with the launch of the S&P BMI International Developed High Beta Index and the S&P BMI Emerging Markets High Beta Index. These indices measure the performance of 200 shares in their respective markets which are highly sensitive to market movements. They may also be used as a benchmark for investors seeking to benefit from market volatility. S&P Indices says that Invesco Powershares has acquired a license to launch ETFs based on the new indices. The asset management firm also wasted no time in announcing the launch on 24 February of the PowerShares S&P Emerging Markets High Beta Portfolio (acronym EEHB) and PowerShares S&P 500 International Developed High Beta Portfolio (IDHB) funds on NYSE-Arca. The ETF funds include the two high beta and low volatility ETFs launched on 5 May 2011 (USd1.3bn in assets) and the two global low volatility funds launched on 13 January 2012. The new products will invest at least 90% of their assets in shares from each index.
