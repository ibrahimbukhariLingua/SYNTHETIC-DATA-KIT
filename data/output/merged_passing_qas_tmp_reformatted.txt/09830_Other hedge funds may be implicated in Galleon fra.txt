Other hedge funds may be implicated in Galleon fraud case


A hedge-fund manager known to prosecutors as «Tipper X» in the Galleon Group insider-trading investigation could lead prosecutors to scrutinize hedge funds not previously implicated in the probe, people familiar with the case say. The manager was identified as Thomas Hardin, a trader at Lanexa Global Management. Mr. Hardin is included in a list of individuals that the Securities and Exchange Commission has provided to defense lawyers as potential witnesses.
