Jérôme Kerviel sues SocGen ahead of his appeal hearing


Les Echos reports that Jérôme Kerviel on Friday filed a lawsuit against Société Générale, his former employer, for “fraudulent judgement.” The bank has announced that it will be suing the former trader for “calumnious denunciation,” and has also announced that it “will be making its arguments as part of the appeals process,” which will take place from 4 to 28 June. Kerviel accuses Société Générale of concealing form a Paris correctional court that through a fiscal disposition it had been able to recuperate EUR1.7bn of the EUR4.9bn that it claims to have lost due to fraud.
