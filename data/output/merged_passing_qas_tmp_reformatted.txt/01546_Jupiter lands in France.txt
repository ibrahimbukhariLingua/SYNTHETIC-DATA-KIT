Jupiter lands in France


As Newsmanagers reported in June of this year, the UK asset management firm Jupiter is opening operations in France. At the time, CEO Edward Bonham-Carter announced the recruitment of a salesperson and the opening of a small branch office in Paris. But ultimately, the firm has signed a partnership with Alfi Partners, a third party marketer. Jupiter, which manages assets of EUR24bn, largely in equities, is not wholly unknown to French investors, as the asset manager is indirectly represented via a fund from CCR, Centrale Croissance Europe, which it manages under a subcontract. This partnership goes back to the time when Commerzbank was a shareholder in both asset management firms, which is no longer the case today, as CCR is owned by UBS, and a majority stake in Jupiter is controlled by its employees. With Alfi, the UK asset management firm is hoping to go a step further on the French market, which it considers to be one of the most important in Europe. It is planning to target professional and qualified French investors with its Luxembourg Sicav Jupiter Global Funds, which has been licensed for sale for some time already. Among the sub-funds which will be promoted in France are an Asia Pacific fund, a climate change fund, and others.
