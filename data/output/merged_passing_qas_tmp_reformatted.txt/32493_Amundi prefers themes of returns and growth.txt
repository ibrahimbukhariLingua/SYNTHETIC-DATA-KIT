Amundi prefers themes of returns and growth


Alain Pitous, head of diversified investments at Amundi, maintains a favourable strategic opinion of equities, even though he has reduced exposure to them to 62% in January, and 54% in February, Agefi reports. In this environment of rising appetite for risk and improving momentum for profits at businesses, the head is maintaining the themes of returns and growth through targeted selections. For fixed income, Pitous remains favourable to credit markets. Carry remains attractive, he explains. Meanwhile, the emerging market theme is being strengthened with investments in local currencies.
