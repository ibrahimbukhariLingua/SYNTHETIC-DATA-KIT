Burlington LM launches bid for SEB Immoinvest stake


Dublin-based Burlington Loan Management Ltd has launched a public takeover bid valid until 27 February for up to 2,855,000 shares in the open-ended real estate fund ImmoInvest (DE0009802306), which the Frankfurt-based firm SEB Asset Management decided to liquidate by 30 April 2017 (see Newsmanagers of 9 May 2012).The offered price is EUR26 in cash per share, which represents a total volume slightly over EUR75m for the takeover bid. But the premium is limited compared with the market price of the shares (EUR25.61 at noon on 11 February, according to Das Investment), and the offered amount may be lowered if the price falls by more than EUR2.60 per share.SEB Asset Management has also announced that it has signed a sale contract for the 5-star Grand Hyatt hotel in Berlin (342 rooms and suites) to the Qatari firm Al Rayyan Tourism and Investment (ARTIC), a firm to which it has also recently sold the Maritim hotel in Hamburg (see Newsmanagers of 7 January). The property also comes from the portfolio of the SEB ImmoInvest fund, and belonged to a group of 19 properties in the Potsdamer Platz district. The sale price has not been disclosed.
