Claymore prepares a volley of 9 high-yield bond ETFs


The asset management firm Claymore (an affiliate of Guggenheim Partners) is planning to launch a series of ETFs on 15 November, which will replicate corporate high-yield bond indices from Accretive Asset Management. It also notified the SEC on 1 September in a N1-A form that it plans to release the Claymore BulletShares High Yield Corporate Bond ETF on the market, with annual maturity dates ranging from 2012 to 2020, within the Claymore Exchange-Traded Fund Trust. The funds, for which the amount of the management commission has not yet been specified, will be managed by Chuck Craig and Saroj Kanuri.
