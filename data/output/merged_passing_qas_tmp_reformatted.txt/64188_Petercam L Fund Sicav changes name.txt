The names of the sub-funds will remain unchanged, however, as will the ISIN codes. For some funds, the costs have been modified. In most cases, they have been reduced. They have been increased for the DPAM L Bonds Government 1-5, DPAM Bonds Universalis Unconstrained and DPAM L Liquidity EUR&FRN funds. Petercam merged with Degroof sligtly over one year ago, whence the change of names for some funds.
