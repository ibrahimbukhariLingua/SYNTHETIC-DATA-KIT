MGEN asset management firm opens to external clients


The asset management firm created in early 2008 to manage the securities portfolios of MGEN, entitled Egamo, which stands for Européenne de gestion d’actifs mobiliers, is now opening its doors to external clients. The wholly-owned subsidiary of the national education mutual has recruited a development specialist from Dexia, Vanessa Karvela, to oversee this development. For the moment, Egamo, which has 14 employees, manages EUR2.1bn for MGEN, and EUR100m for third parties. As a result of the asset allocation of its parent company, the asset manager has nearly half of its directly-managed assets in bonds. The remainder, including equities, alternative investments, and cash, are managed through multi-management. Egamo is now planning to offer its expertise in bonds, multi-management and asset allocation to other investors. Naturally, the management firm is planning to address mutuals first and foremost, “a population which we resemble and which we understand,” explains Nicholas Demont, former CFO of MGEN, and current CEO of Egamo. Institutionals such as retirement planning institutions, pension funds, associations and institutional charities will also be among the target clients of the MGEN subsidiary.
