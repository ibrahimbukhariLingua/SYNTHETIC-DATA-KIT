P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The US asset management firm Russell Investments will provide the Italian firm Anima with advising services to construct and manage multi-asset class management products, the two firms have announced in a statement. The collaboration between the two management players will affect funds in the Capitale Più and Forza ranges and will initially affect assets of EUR1bn, while Anima has over EUR40bn in assets under management. A statement says, however, that this is a first step, and that the agreement is likely to be extended. “Russell Investments will provide Anima with significant support in the selection of the best managers,” says Marco Carreri, deputy director of the Italian firm. Russell Investments, which has assets under management of about USD173bn as of 31 March, has offices in Milan. Anima is an Italian asset management firm which counts the private equity fund Clessidra and the Italian banks Banca Popolare di Milano, Banca Monte dei Paschi and Credito Valtellinese among its shareholders.
