Telecom: Italian regulator attacks BlackRock again


There has been another dramatic turn in the Telecom Italia-BlackRock case, Il Sole – 24 Ore reports. The Italian regulator, Consob, has decided to open an investigation into the role and the voting choices of major US investment funds during the last general shareholders’ meeting at Telecom Italia, which was held in mid-December to study a removal of directors due to conflicts of interest. The meeting rejected the measure. Consob would now like to throw light on the “abnormal behaviour” of some key shareholders at the group, especially BlackRock, which controls 10.1% of the group.
