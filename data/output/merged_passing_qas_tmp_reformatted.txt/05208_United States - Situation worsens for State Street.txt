United States - Situation worsens for State Street


Although State Street will this Tuesday announce profits of about USD1 per share for fourth quarter 2008, compared with 57 cents at the beginning of last year, bad news will follow soon on its heels, the Wall Street Journal warns. Although the management firm has held out relatively well so far through the financial crisis, State Street is now beginning to suffer in some of its key activities. For example, in its SEC filing on Friday, State Street cited losses in the value of its conservative investments in areas such as money markets, the newspaper reports. The asset management firm is also warning that there are USD5.5bn in unrealized after-tax losses present in its investment portfolio, and latent capital losses of USD3.6bn for other vehicles which issue Asset-Backed Commercial Paper.
