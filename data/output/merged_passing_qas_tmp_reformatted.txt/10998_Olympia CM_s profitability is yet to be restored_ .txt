Olympia CM’s profitability is yet to be restored, says Fitch


“Relieved from its debt burden, following its acquisition by Richmond Park Capital Holding Limited (RPCHL) in April 2011, Olympia Capital Management now benefits from improved financial flexibility, although profitability is yet to be restored,” Fitch Ratings says in its most recent report of the alternative management firm based in Paris. The ratings agency has affirmed Paris-based company Asset Manager Rating of ‘M2' for its fund of hedge funds activities. Fitch finds that OCM, which manages USD2bn in assets, half of which are in funds of hedge funds, is still faced with the challenge to enlarge its operations, against a backdrop of turbulent market conditions, in order to restore the company’s financial standing. The company has continued to refine its operational efficiency while selectively expanding resources, notably in the international client relationship domain, and renewing research staff. A new CFO was appointed in October. The agency notes that cost-cutting measures implemented over the past six months should fully materialise in 2012 financials.
