Mergers and acquisitions: European decision-makers call for stimulation of growth


European decision-makers are calling on public powers to abandon austerity plans in favour of spending measures that might revitalise the merger/acquisition market in 2013. These are the findings of the third edition of “doing the Deal” an annual study by NetJets Europe of the European transaction market. “Doing the Deal” examined responses from 175 European decision-makers active at private equity firms, investment banks, accounting and law firms, who worked on transactions totalling over EUR136bn last year. The survey was undertaken by Remark, the merger/acquisition and IPO research department of the agency mergermarket. The study finds that slightly under half of European decision-makers (48%) predict that merger/acquisition activity will increase in 2013. The growth in transactions is estimated at EUR227bn in value, which would bring the overall total to over EUR1.7trn, down EUR300bn compared with 2012 projections. It is also noted that 26% predict that M&A activities will turn down in 2013, compared with 8% in 2012, due to ongoing lack of confidence, or with a cautiously optimistic outlook for next year. The report more closely examines the euro zone crisis and its potential impact on M&A activity in 2013. 55% of respondents say that austerity measures generally preferred by European authorities are currently hampering merger and activity activities and economic prosperity. 79% of decision-makers estimate that the solution to the economic problems is to inject capital into national economies, compared with only 13% who predict a return to growth due to austerity measures, Despite these negative opinions, only 1% of participants expect any members of the euro zone to leave the union. When asked which one, most cite Greece.
