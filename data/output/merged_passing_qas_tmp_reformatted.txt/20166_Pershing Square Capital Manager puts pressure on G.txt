Pershing Square Capital Manager puts pressure on General Growth


The hedge fund manager William Ackman, head of Pershing Square Capital Management, is putting pressure on the shopping centre manager General Growth Properties, and has twice called for the firm to be put up for sale in letters. Ackman suggests that the second-largest firm in shopping centres in the United States should not allow the asset management firm Brookfield Asset Management take control of the firm, in which Brookfield already controls a 42% stake. Ackman goes so far as to say that the leading shopping centre player, Simon Property Group, would be an excellent acquisition candidate. Brookfield Asset Management, which in 2010 helped to prevent bankruptcy at General Growth, has since claimed that it does not want to increase its stake in the firm. Pershing Square owns 10.5% of capital in General Growth.
