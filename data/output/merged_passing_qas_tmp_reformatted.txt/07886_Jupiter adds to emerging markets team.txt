Jupiter adds to emerging markets team


Jupiter Asset Management has appointed Kathryn Langridge as an emerging markets fund manager. She will join Jupiterâ€™s emerging markets desk in September. Jupiter has now some GBP1.2bn invested in products covering many of the key emerging markets in the world. The emerging markets team manages eight mutual funds focusing on emerging Europe, Asia ex-Japan, China and India. Jupiter intends, in due course, to bolster this range by launching a global emerging markets fund for Kathryn to manage, subject to regulatory approval. At Lloyd George Asset Management, Kathryn Langridge has been managing long only emerging market equity investment portfolios since 2007. Before that, Kathryn worked for 17 years at Invesco Perpetual with roles including Head of Asian Investments and Head of International Equity Products.
