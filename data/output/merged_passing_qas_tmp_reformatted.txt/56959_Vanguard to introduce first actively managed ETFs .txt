Vanguard to introduce first actively managed ETFs with suite of factor funds


Vanguard filed a registration statement for six new factor-based ETFs and one factor-based mutual fund, representing Vanguard’s first introduction of actively managed ETFs in the U.S. The company currently offers suites of active factor ETFs in Canada and the United Kingdom. The new factor funds are expected to begin trading in the first quarter of 2018. Five single factor funds are designed for financial advisors and institutional investors seeking to achieve specific risk or return objectives through targeted factor exposures: minimum volatility, value, momentum, liquidity, and quality. The sixth ETF and fund will offer a multi-factor approach. Vanguard will employ an active, rules-based quantitative approach in managing the funds, which will also feature the traditional characteristic of all Vanguard funds—low cost. “Our factor-based fund offerings serve as a valuable extension of our low-cost active lineup, providing additional ways for suitable investors to help meet their long-term objectives by targeting exposure to specific factors in the market,” said Vanguard Chief Investment Officer Greg Davis. “With Vanguard’s actively managed, rules-based approach to factors, investors can now harness well-known factor exposure in a more transparent and low-cost way.” The new suite of active factor offerings includes: : - Vanguard U.S. Minimun Volatility ETF,- Vanguard U.S. Value Factor ETF,- Vanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF,- Vanguard U.S. Liquidity Factor ETF,- Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF,- Vanguard U.S. Multifactor ETF,- Vanguard U.S. Multifactor Fund.The five single factor-based ETFs will have an estimated expense ratio of 0.13%; the Multifactor ETF and Multifactor Fund will have an estimated expense ratio of 0.18%. The Multifactor Fund will require a minimum initial investment of $50,000 for Admiral Shares.
