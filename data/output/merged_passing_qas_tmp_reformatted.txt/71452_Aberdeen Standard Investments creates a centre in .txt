Aberdeen Standard Investments creates a centre in Dublin ahead of Brexit


Aberdeen Standard Investments (ASI) intends to establish an investment and distribution business in Dublin, Ireland. Subject to regulatory approval, the new entity will be one of ASI’s key European Union business hubs, responsible for the contracting of investment management services in Europe and for ASI’s network of branch offices across the continent. The Dublin-based hub will complement ASI’s Luxembourg operation which manages over 100 funds that are marketed across Europe and in many parts of Asia and the Americas. ASI manages over €70 billion on behalf of customers and clients based in Europe ex-UK.Victoria Brown has been appointed Managing Director of the new entity, again subject to regulatory approval, and will work alongside Jennifer Richards, Head of Distribution – Ireland. Victoria joined Aberdeen Asset Management as a graduate trainee in 2000 and is currently Head of Regional Management – EMEA having previously lead Aberdeen’s Luxembourg operation. Jennifer joined Standard Life Investments (SLI) in 2004 to lead the Irish distribution team. Jennifer is a Director of a number of SLI funds including Luxembourg SICAVs and Irish Liquidity Funds. Prior to joining SLI, Jennifer worked as an Investment Consultant with Mercer in Dublin and as a Client Portfolio Manager with AIB Investment Managers.“The Irish hub, which will contract directly with European clients and oversee our European branches, complements our Luxembourg hub which manages funds across Europe. These two businesses, working together and with our German business based in Frankfurt will ensure that we continue to meet the needs of our customers and clients across Europe, after the UK leaves the European Union. It is a combination that will give clear and distinct focus to the needs and aspirations of our clients in the EU27 countries», comments Gary Marshall, Head of EMEA at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
