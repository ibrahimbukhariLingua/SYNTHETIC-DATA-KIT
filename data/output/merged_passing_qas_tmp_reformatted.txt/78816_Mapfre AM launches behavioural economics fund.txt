Mapfre AM launches behavioural economics fund


Mapfre AM is launching the ‘Mapfre AM Behavioral Fund’, a fund aiming to exploit pricing inefficiencies in European equities caused by the behaviour of market participants. Mapfre AM has developed a proprietary methodology for identifying opportunities caused by investors reacting to new information in exaggerated or irrational ways. The managers then apply detailed fundamental analysis to determine whether these equities represent attractive long-term investments. The fund managers are Luis García and Michael Morosi, «Understanding why market participants behave as they do is an important aspect of asset management and a great tool for those that follow a value investment philosophy,” said Luis Garcia. The managers’ investment process will be supported by an advisory board composed of recognised experts in the field of the behavioural economics. The team is made up of Natalia Cassinello, professor of finance of The Universidad Pontificia Comillas (ICADE); Pedro Rey Biel, professor of economics at ESADE; Pedro Bermejo, neurologist at The Puerta de Hierro University Hospital of Madrid and president of the Spanish Association of Neuroeconomics; and, Guillermo Llorente, Mapfre’s general director of Security. The fund, which is the first of its kind to be launched in Spain, will seek to invest primarily in companies that have a simple business model, are capable of generating cash, have a sustainable competitive edge, a low level of indebtedness and, in many cases, managed by the founding families whose interests are well aligned with those of their shareholders. The fund will be distributed mainly in Spain and France and will be domiciled in Luxembourg, so that it can be available to other international investors.
