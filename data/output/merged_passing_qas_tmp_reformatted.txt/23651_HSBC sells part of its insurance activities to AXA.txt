HSBC sells part of its insurance activities to AXA and QBE


The British banking group HSBC on 7 March announced in a statement that it is selling its insurance activities in four countries for a total of USD914m (EUR695.5m), in two different operations, to the French firm AXA and the Australian QBE. The transactions “will allow us to concentrate our capital and resources on the growth of our core activities, including the development of our wealth management capacities,” the chairman and CEO of the banking group, Stuart Gulliver, says in a statement. HSBC Insurance (Asia), HSBC Insurance (Singapore), and HSBC Seguros, all three affiliates of HSBC, will sell their general insurance portfolios in Hong Kong, Singapore and Mexico to AXA, for about USD494m in cash, the bank says. HSBC has also decided to sell its general insurance activities in Argentina to QBE Insurance. Under this separate agreement, the Australian group will also buy Hang Seng General Insurance (Hong Kong), an affiliate of Hang Seng Bank, based in Hong Kong and 62% controlled by HSBC. For these two acquisitions, QBE will pay USD420m.
