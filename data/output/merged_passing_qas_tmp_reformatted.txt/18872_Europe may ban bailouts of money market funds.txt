Europe may ban bailouts of money market funds


The European Systemic Risk Board is reported to be in the process of studying a controversial plan to forbid money market fund managers from bailing out investors if their funds suffer losses, Financial Times Fund Management reveals. Only two money market funds have lost investors’ money. But, according to Moody’s, 62 money market funds were bailed out by their sponsors or parent companies during the financial crisis, at a cost of at least USD12.1bn.
