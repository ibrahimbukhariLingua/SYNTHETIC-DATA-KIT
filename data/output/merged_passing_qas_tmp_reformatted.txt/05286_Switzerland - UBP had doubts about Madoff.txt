Switzerland - UBP had doubts about Madoff


Union Bancaire Privée had placed clients’ capital totalling several hundred million US dollars with Bernard Madoff, despite warnings to the clients from the bank’s own research team, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing sources close to the bank and internal emails. In early 2007, the research department at UBP expressed some concerns about Madoff’s activities. Later, it recommended that Madoff be removed from a list of fund managers approved for investments by clients. The directors of the bank were aware of the doubts and even dicussed them, the WSJ reports.
