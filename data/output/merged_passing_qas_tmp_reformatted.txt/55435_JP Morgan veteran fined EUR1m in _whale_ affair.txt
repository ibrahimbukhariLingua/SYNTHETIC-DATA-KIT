JP Morgan veteran fined EUR1m in “whale” affair


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The British authorities on 9 February announced that they have levelled against a former JP Morgan head for his lack of cooperation during the “whale of London” affair, which caused losses of USD6bn for the US bank in 2012. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has announced that Achilles Macris, former director of international investments at the London-based firm, will have to pay GBP792,000, or about EUR1m. “He was responsible for a number of portfolios, including the synthetic debt portfolio, at the time of the brokerage operations known as the whale of London”, the FCA explains in a statement. The name was given to an employee at JPMorgan, the Frenchman Bruno Iksil, due to his enormous risky bets on European credit derivatives, which became too visible in early 2012. Other traders turned against him, forcing the US bank to pare back its positions, ultimately costing it USD6bn. As his direct superviser, Macris should have spoken to the authorities in an “open and cooperative” manner, but in reality concealed the scale of the problem in his conversations with regulators when they began to investigate, the FCA says. “Not communicating in an open manner with us can affect the course of the markets and cause undue damages to investors, particularly at times of stress or financial crisis,” says Mark Steward, director of market suppression and supervision at the FCA, cited in a statement. “Regulators require open communication with businesses so that the correct decisions can be taken as soon as possible. Mr. Macris should have explained the situation more honestly, particularly when he learned that losses on the synthetic credit portfolio had worsened”, he added.
