French authorities issue warning over Segap Lloyd’s RCP


The banking and insurance regulatory authorities on 10 July issued a warning about the activities of the British firm Segap Lloyd’s, which has been offering insurance policies and banking services in France without a license to do so.The firm in question has not obtained permission from the British authorities to practice insurance operations, and is not licensed in France, as a result of which “insurance policies purchased from this entity are null and void,” according to a public statement from ACAM (Autorité de contrôle des assurances et des mutuelles), CECEI (Comité des établissements de crédit et des entreprises d’investissement), the Banking Commission and the deposit guarantee fund.Segap Lloyd’s appears to be seeking to take advantage of possible confusion with another firm, the French online broker Segap, which has all the necessary licenses to operate in France.
