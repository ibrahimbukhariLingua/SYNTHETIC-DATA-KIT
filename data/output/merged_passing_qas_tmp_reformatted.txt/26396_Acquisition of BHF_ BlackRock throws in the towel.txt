Acquisition of BHF: BlackRock throws in the towel


BlackRock has let the deadline which had been set for it by BaFin pass without responding to indicate the financial resources it would be prepared to make available if BHF-Bank were faced with a crisis. As a result, the US asset management firm is pulling out of the consortium led by Kleinwort Benson Group Ltd (KBG), an affiliate of RHJ International (RHJI), to acquire the German private bank from Deutsche Bank for EUR354m, of which EUR322m would be in cash and 9% in shares in RHJ International, KBG says in a statement released on 30 October. BlackRock was supposed to contribute to the deal for a total of EUR50m.As a result, the terms of the KBG capital increase have been modified, and RHJI will retain a 65% stake instead of 60%, while the remaining 35% will be distributed between the three remaining partners, Fosun Group, AQTON SE (a portfolio firm belonging to Stefan Quandt) and various companies of Timothy C. Collins.Deutsche Bank has been seeking to sell BHF-Bank, which had been part of the Sal. Oppenheim group, for three years. Initially, Deutsche Bank had been expecting to make about EUR500m on it.
