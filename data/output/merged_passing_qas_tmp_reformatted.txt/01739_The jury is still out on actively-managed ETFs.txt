The jury is still out on actively-managed ETFs


In an interview with Asian Investor, Tony Rochte, senior managing director of State Street Global Advisers (SSgA), claims that “there is a lot of talk about actively-managed ETFs, but they have had a slow start. This evolution is due to the fact that investors looking for actively-managed ETFs want to see a track record of one, three, or five years. For investors who really want to pay added commissions, the performance has to be there. In other words, we don’t have a definite opinion yet about actively-managed ETFs, but that doesn’t mean that we’re not interested. We have also submitted applications to launched an actively-managed ETF and a horizon ETF in the United States. Rochte also states that SSgA has no immediate plans to launch inverse or leveraged ETFs.
