CalPERS adopts a policy of increased transparency for ?placement agents?


Rob Feckner, chairman of the board at CalPERS, has announced that the California pension fund (USD177bn in assets) has adopted a new policy which requires external managers to disclose details of commissions they pay to placement agents and other information about their dealings with these entities in order to obtain mandates from CalPERS. The agencies will also be required to be registered with the SEC and Finra as broker-dealers: if they are not, CalPERS will refuse to award the mandates to the asset management firm.These new rules come in the wake of the recent ?pay-to-play? scandal, in which a ranking politician in New York used his influence at the city pension fund to direct mandates to certain asset management firms who paid him for the favour.
