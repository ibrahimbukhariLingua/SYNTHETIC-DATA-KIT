BlackRock reshuffles management of funds in Asia-Pacific


BlackRock is profoundly overhauling its management teams in Asia Pacific. According to eFinancial News, the asset management firm has separated the responsibilities for its funds in the region, which represent USD600m, following the departure of director Robert Weatherston, responsible for the funds, who left the business last week after 18 years. Weatherston had been director of the Japan Value Equity team, oversaw the Japan Value, International Value and Pacific Equity portfolios. His departure thus introduces a new distribution of responsibilities at BlackRock in the region. Marc Desmidt, head of alpha strategies and management of strategic products for Asia-Pacific, has been promoted to the position of lead manager of the BGF Japan Value Fund (USD275m in assets) and BGF Japan Fund (USD90.4m in assets). Meanwhile, Andrew Swan has been appointed as lead manager of the BGF Pacific Fund, which has USD231m in assets, while providing management of several other funds in the region. Finally, BlackRock has announced the appointment of Oisin Crawley as head of research for the Asian fundamental equity research team, based in Hong Kong.
