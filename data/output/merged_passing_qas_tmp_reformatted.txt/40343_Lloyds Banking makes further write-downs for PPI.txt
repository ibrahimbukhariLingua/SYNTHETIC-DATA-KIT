Lloyds Banking makes further write-downs for PPI


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The British bank Lloyds Banking Group (LBG), which was bailed out by the government in 2008, on 3 February announced nearly GBP2bn in new provisions, but promised a return to dividends in second half. In an unscheduled statement, released ahead of the release of annual results on 13 February, LBG has stated that it will be writing down a provision of GBP1.8bn in fourth quarter, related to litigation concerning PPI credit insurance, and another GBP130m related to abusive sales to SMEs of products to protect against interest rate variations. LBG has previously written down billions of pounds to cover compensation payments related to the PPI scandal. Despite that, the bank promises that it will earn a “small” pre-tax profit for 2013, and that it is planning to request permission to restart dividend payments in second half.
