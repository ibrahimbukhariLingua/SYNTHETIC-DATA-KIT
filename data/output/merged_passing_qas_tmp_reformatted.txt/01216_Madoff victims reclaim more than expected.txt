Madoff victims reclaim more than expected


For some victims of the Madoff fraud, the financial damage likely will not be as bad as originally feared, the Wall Street Journal predicts. Irving Picard, the trustee in charge of unwinding the scheme, has recovered USD1.5bn in assets to compensate about USD19.4bn in losses. He has also filed lawsuits to obtain USD15bn from some Madoff clients who made money at the expense of others. Investors may also tax deduct all of their Madoff losses.
