Moody’s: Obama tax would threaten solvency of US banks


According to the ratings agency Moody’s, cited by Agefi, the Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee, which would bring in USD90bn for the US government over the next ten years, would have a severe effect on banks. Moody’s claims that the tax would raise financing costs significantly for banks required to pay it. The maintenance of liquidity pools would also become more costly. “If a bank decides to reduce its pools due to increased costs related to the tax, its solvency would be weakened,” concludes Peter Nerby, an analyst at the ratings agency.
