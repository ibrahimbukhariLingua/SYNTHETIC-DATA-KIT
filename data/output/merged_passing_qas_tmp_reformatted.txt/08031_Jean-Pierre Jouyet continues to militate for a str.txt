Jean-Pierre Jouyet continues to militate for a strong ESMA


The chairman of the French financial market regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), Jean-Pierre Jouyet, on Monday, at a presentation of the authority’s 2009 annual report, announced its priorities for 2010-2011. “The most important, for me, is the rapid installation of a European market agency with real powers,” Jouyet said. In this regard, he was critical of several proposals by the European commission and council, which could prevent the future ESMA (European financial market authority) from fulfilling its missions. The initial objective of a larger integration and supervision and harmonised protection of savings investors would then be lost, and it is thus necessary to find a political compromise as soon as possible in this area. “I am rallying votes for a French-German agreement and will be the driving force behind it,” as “without powerful European authority, there will be no effective and consistent regulation, and without effective and consistent regulation, there will be no credible national regulation,” he said. Another priority area will be regulation of over-the-counter markets and revision of the MiFID directive. Jouyet says that it is necessary to “compensate, standardise and register.” To this end, the AMF would be inclined to collect data on OTC derivatives from May 2011, on a voluntary basis. In addition to localisation of post-market infrastructures in Europe and the Euro zone, Jouyet estimates that it is important to massively reorient trading flows towards organised markets, not only for derivatives, but also for equities and bonds. The third priority area is regulation of short positions. The AMF chairman says that it is necessary to have a European response in this area. “Imposing transparency measures and rigorous treatment of settlement and clearing suspensions appears to me to be immediately more effective,” Jouyet commented.
