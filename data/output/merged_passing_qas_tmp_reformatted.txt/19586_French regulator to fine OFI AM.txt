At a hearing of the sanctions committee of the French financial regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) on 20 September, in the case of the asset management firm OFI, the AMF College handed down a reprimand and a fine of EUR500,000 against OFI AM, as well as a warning to two of its directors, and a fine of EUR60,000 each, Les Echos reports.The college found that OFI AM had not undertaken required due diligence in the selection and monitoring of funds related to the Bernard Madoff company between June 2006 and the end of 2008. The firm also faced other charges: it failed to respect regulatory ratios, and invested in excess of the permitted maximal levels in some types of funds unrelated to Madoff.
