Hedge funds will stay in Europe despite regulatory pressure


Toughening legislation in Europe will not be likely to lead to hedge funds based in Europe moving to more clement lands, the head of Man Group, Peter Clarke, predicts, cited by FundWeb. From Clarkeâ€™s point of view, an exodus of hedge funds to other jurisdictions such as Switzerland or Asian countries when the AIFM legislation comes in to force, is not a priori to be expected. Clarke estimates that the revised text of the AIFM directive is not as tough as some members of the hedge fund community had feared. A move, meanwhile, is a long and costly process, which may also take 18 to 24 months.
