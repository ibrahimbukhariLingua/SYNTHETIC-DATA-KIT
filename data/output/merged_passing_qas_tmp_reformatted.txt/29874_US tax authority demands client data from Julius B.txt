US tax authority demands client data from Julius Baer


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The US tax authorities are requiring private client data from Julius Bär, under an administrative assistance request. The clients have been informed by the bank that the tax authority, the IRS, has requested administrative assistance, the Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung reports. The bank has confirmed receipt of the request. The request came from the Asset Forfeiture Coordinator (AFC) and affects clients of Julius Bär suspected by the IRS of “tax fraud.” Nearly 100 clients are reportedly affected by the move, the newspaper reports. After the case of UBS and the request for administrative assistance made to Credit Suisse last year, this is the third group request from the United States.
