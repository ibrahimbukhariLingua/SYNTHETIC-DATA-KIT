Cobas has asked Aryzta’s Board of Directors to call an EGM


As the largest shareholder of Aryzta with 14.5% of the shares and votes, Cobas endorses measures to strengthen the balance sheet to enable Aryzta to develop its value creation potential. However, Cobas cannot defend actions that lead to such destruction of shareholder-value as would occur through the highly dilutive capital increase proposed by Aryzta’s Board of Directors, said a press release. Therefore, Cobas sees itself compelled to vote against the Board of Directors’ proposal at the upcoming AGM.As a result, Cobas has developed together with financial advisors an alternative plan that supports the company to the same extent – while protecting shareholder – value as well as enabling future value creation. Cobas will support a EUR 400 million capital increase. Cobas will ask the Board to seek the sale of some non-core assets. Serious expressions of interest from third parties for several assets have already been received: Non -core assets amounting to at least EUR 250 million in value, for which a ready buyer at a reasonable price is available, could be disposed of in a very short time frame According to Cobas, this alternative proposal of raising EUR 650 million (EUR 640 million net of expenses) significantly improves the outlook for shareholders in the medium term in comparison to the EUR 800 million (EUR 750 million net of expenses) proposed by the Board."Despite the beneficial alternative proposal of Cobas, Aryzta’s Board of Directors has unfortunately rejected the addition of our proposition to the agenda of the AGM on November l. Consequently, Cobas has asked Aryzta’s Board of Directors to call an EGM to present this proposal directly to all shareholders, subject to the majority of the shareholders rejecting the proposed EUR 800 million capital increase in the forthcoming AGM. We expect the Board of Directors to call the EGM as soon as possible.However, should the majority of the shareholders unexpectedly support the Board of Director’s proposed EUR 800 million increase at the AGM, Cobas intends to fully exercise its pro rata share in the rights issue to emphasize its full support towards Aryzta at all times», concludes the press release.
