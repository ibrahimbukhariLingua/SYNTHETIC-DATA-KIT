Michael Baer launches a private bank


Michael Baer, a descendant (great-grandson) of the founder of the Julius Baer private bank about 130 years ago, is making his debut in the financial industry. He has created Mbaer Merchant Bank with Swiss and international partners and seed capital of CHF30m. The new player in the industry will be based in Zurich, and will profile itself as a bank serving entrepreneurs, their families, and their companies. “In our conversations with many companies, we have time and time again observed an enormous need for a bank that places personal and individual contacts at the forefront. Clients want to be able to discuss with decision-makers, and don’t want to have to deal with a faceless establishment,” Michael Baer explains in a statement. He had previously been chairman of Baer Capital Partners and of Charlemagne Capital (an investment group specialised in emerging markets, with over USD3bn in assets under management). The services offered by Mbaer include wealth management, liability-driven management (LDM), risk management, and financing for commercial transactions. The bank already has more than 10 employees, including several specialists in wealth management.
