Asian brokers need to stand out from the crowd


For Asian brokers, two objectives appear particularly important in the current market context: standing out from the crowd in order to attract clients, and automating their operations.Those are the findings of a survey of the industry commissioned by BNP Paribas Securities Services and SWIFT, undertaken in April and May 2011. More than 75% of respondents consider outsourcing an adequate solution to manage the complecity and cost of post-trade processes.The survey also finds that brokers in the region feel the need to privilege activities which generate revenues for the firms themselves, such as third-party clearing.
