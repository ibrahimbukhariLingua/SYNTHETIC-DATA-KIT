As part of an initiative to develop its activities in Asia, Threadneedle will transfer William Lowndes, its head of Asian distribution, from London to Hong Kong, effecting 1 April. He will be head of the local team, and will be in charge not only of development but also of strengthening Threadneedleâ€™s strategic partnerships with distributors including Standard Chartered Bank (Stanchart) and Tokio Marine, while continuing to work in close collaboration with private and commercial banks, family offices and institutional clients. The British asset management firm has also announced the recruitment of Jon Allen on 25 January as deputy head of Asian distribution, in which role he will assist Lowndes. He will be based in Singapore. Allen spent the last two years as CEO and a shareholder in Carnelian Capital and Obverse Capital, management firms specialised in Asian distressed debt.
