United Kingdom - Shortfall for RBS pension fund


The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) announced on Thursday that its pension fund, which had a surplus of GBP340m at the end of 2007, was underfinanced by nearly GBP2bn 12 months later, Global Pensions reports. The deterioration is due to market effects, which were partly compensated for by income from AA+ rated corporate bonds and a reduction in the estimated inflation rate.
