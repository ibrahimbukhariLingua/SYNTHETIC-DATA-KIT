Investors remain on the defensive


Investors facing concerns related to Greek government debt and reduced growth on global markets have remained on the defensive in the week to 25 May. Equities funds saw outflows of USD9.25bn in the week under review, while bond funds saw inflows of USD4.53bn, according to statistics from EPFR Global. Money market funds attracted nearly USD8bn, as inflows to US funds largely compensated for outflows from European funds. Funds dedicated to emerging markets equities underwent their second consecutive week of redemptions, meaning that since the beginning of the year, net outflows have totalled USD8.6bn.
