Germany considers tax on banking sector


The German government will in April vote on a tax on the banking sector intended to redistribute the cost of bank bailouts, Finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble has told the newspaper Bild, Agefi reports. The minister has said that it is difficult to legally limit speculation on financial markets. “Naturally, we need stricter rules, but we must not overreact and stifle the free markets and competition, since that would paralyse the economy,” he said. “It is unfortunately very difficult to distinguish between good financial transactions and bad ones,” Schäuble added.
