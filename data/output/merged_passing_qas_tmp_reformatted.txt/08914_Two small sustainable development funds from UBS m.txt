Two small sustainable development funds from UBS merge


With effect from 26 March, the Sustainable European Equities (EUR) P-acc sub-fund of the Sicav UBS (Lux) Equity Fund 2 has been absorbed into the Sustainable Global Leaders (EUR) P-acc (EUR3.38m as of the end of January, according to Fondsweb), the UBS Responsibility Fund Management Company has announced. The operation is notable for the motives cited by the management firm: weak demand for the “best-in-class” strategy, and the low level of subscriptions render it impossible to freeze the fund in a profitable and effective manner.
