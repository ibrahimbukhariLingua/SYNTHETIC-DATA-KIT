Afer: 55,000 members seek restitution


Afer, which has been the subject of a fraud scandal involving the period from Deember 1986 to July 1997, which has been mandated by 55,000 of its members to recuperate EUR24m in assets confiscated by the courts, last Thursday submitted a restitution request before the Paris court of appeals, Les Echos reports, relaying a report by AFP on 2 January. In December 2009, the two founding directors of Afer, Gérard Athias and André Le Saux, were sentenced by the Court of Cassation to two years in prison, with suspended sentence, and a fine of EUR200,000 for abuse of trust. The Paris court of appeals found them guilty of having skimmed nearly EUR128m from Afer members, via a hidden remuneration agreement with the insurer Abeille Vie (which later became Aviva), the provider of retirement savings policies to members of the association.
