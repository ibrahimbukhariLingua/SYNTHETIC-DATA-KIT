Rathbone profits down 28% in first half


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } It has been a difficult start to the year from Rathbone Brothers (Rathbones). At the conclusion of first half, the British asset and wealth management firm has earned pre-tax profits of GBP22.8m, compared with GBP31.8m one year previously, a decline of 28.3%. The firm explains that this situation is due to the impact of costs related to the acquisition of the financial advising network Vision Group, and its move to London. Underlying pre-tax profits, which do not take these one-time items into account, are down only 5.1%, to a total of GBP35.3m as of the end of June 2016, compared with GBP37.2m as of the end of June 2015. Despite these mixed financial results, Rathbones has good reasons to be satisfied. As of 30 June 2016, assets under management total GBP30.6m, an increase of 4.8% compared with the end of December 2015 (GBP29.2bn in assets). The Investment Management unit now has GBP27.3bn in assets, whille the Unit Trust unit has GBP3.3bn in assets under management. In the past quarter, the Investment Management unit posted net inflows of GBP500m, compared with GBP600m in first half 2015. The Unit Trust unit, for its part, earned GBP259m in net subscriptions, compared with GBP107m in the same period of 2015.
