C-Quadrat unveils “iQ” ETF concept


As announced a few weeks ago (see Newsmanagers of 26 March), the Austrian-German management firm C-Quadrat on Thursday unveiled its future range of “intelligent” ETFs with the brand name “iQ,” the first of which is expected to receive a sales license for Germany in the near future, and will then be released on the XTF segment of Deutsche Börse. The fund will deploy a leveraged long/short/cash strategy investing from the universe of the Euro Stoxx 50, while the benchmark will be the C-QUADRAT European Equity Index. The objective will be to outperform the Euro Stoxx 50. The first ETF of the iQ range will be launched by the Luxembourg firm Commerz Derivatives Funds Solutions. The strategy is based on seven daily indicators developed by C-Quadrat, which will bring together in a single product limited risk, transparency, liquidity, and flexibility of use. Thomas Rieß, founder and CEO of C-Quadrat, says that iQ ETF products based on the FTSE 100, S&P 50-0 and future bunds may be launched in the second or third quarters of this year.
