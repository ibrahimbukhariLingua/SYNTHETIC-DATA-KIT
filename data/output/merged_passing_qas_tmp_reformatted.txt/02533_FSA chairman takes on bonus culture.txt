FSA chairman takes on bonus culture


Les Echos reports that Lord Adair Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, accuses banks in the United Kingdom of taking excessive risks. In an interview with Prospect magazine, carried yesterday by many British newspapers, Lord Adair asks questions about the social utility of the City, and proposes to establish a special tax on bonuses modelled on the Tobin tax. If pay scales are too high in the banking sector, the head of the FSA says, it is due to “caricatural financial deregulation” in the past few decades, which has left the City “overdeveloped.”
