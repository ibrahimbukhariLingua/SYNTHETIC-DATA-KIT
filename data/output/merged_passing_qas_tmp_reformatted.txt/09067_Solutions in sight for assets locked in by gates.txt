Solutions in sight for assets locked in by gates


Agefi Switzerland reports that Gamma Finance will be coming to the aid of institutionals whose assets are locked in by gates. The London-based firm, which was co-founded by a former employee of Société Générale and Deutsche Bank, Florian de Sigy, and a former Barclays Global Investors employee, Javier Rodriguez, will offer to stand as an intermediary between private banks which are seeking to sell off locked-in positions, and investors interested in buying up the shares at a discount that may range from 5% to 30%, depending on the quality of the fund. “This kind of intermediation previously existed mostly in the area of private equity. We were surprised that there were no equivalents in the hedge fund industry,” explains de Sigy, whose firm, founded in early 2009, now employs three people, and is seeking three more experts.
