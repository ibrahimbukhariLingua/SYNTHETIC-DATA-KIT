Robeco renames oldest equity fund in Europe


Robeco Institutional Asset Management has recently announced an adjustment in the investment policy of the equity fund Robeco N.V. “This change will allow Robeco to better position itself in light of market changes, and make this fund, the oldest in Europe, first put on sale in 1933, more solid for the future,” a statement explains. For the same occasion, the fund will be renamed as Robeco Global Stars Equities Fund N.V., to better reflect its investment universe.With assets of EUR2.8bn, the fund will be more concentrated, and will see the number of positions it holds reduced from about 80 to 30-40 positions. “This more concentrated investment approach can be expected to improve the odds of obtaining good investment results, by investing only in companies which the Global Equity management team is convinced will perform well. This approach is already being used for the Luxembourg fund Global Stars Equities, managed by the same team for eight years,” the group explains. The management team will not change, nor will the investment philosophy, risk profile or volatility.
