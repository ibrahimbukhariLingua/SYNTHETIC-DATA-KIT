Russell prepares to launch its first British OEICS


Investment Week reports that Russell Investments is planning to release its first OEICS products domiciled in the United Kingdom in the next two months. The group is planning to launch four vehicles, with assets under management of EUR75m. The range will include two growth-style equities funds, one of which will be focused on the United Kingdom, while the other will be global; one defensive fund based on corporate and government bonds with good ratings; and lastly, a fund of shares in realty firms entitled Real Assets. All of these products, however, must first obtain licenses from the Financial Services Authority.
