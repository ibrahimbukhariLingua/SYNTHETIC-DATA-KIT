Europe - Record fine for Intel


For abuse of its dominant position between October 2002 and December 2007 in the x86 processor market, and discounts offered by the group and direct payments to computer manufacturers to compel them to choose its products over those of its rival AMD, the European Commission has levelled a record fine of EUR1.06bn against Intel, L’Agefi reports. The EU has given Intel three months to pay the fine. The US group has decided to appeal the decision, and the sun will be placed in escrow in the interim. The European Court of Appeals may lower the fine. According to experts, the real fine will not equal this sum, but will be decided by the appeals court verdict. The Commission has required an immediate cessation of the business practices in question and has warned that it will ?actively monitor respect for the present decision.? Intel will be required to ?go through its commercial relations with a fine-toothed comb.? This also opens the door to civil suits against Intel, with one class action case to be heard in Delaware in 2010. The FTC will also take action in the case. An FTC investigation was launched last June, which comes in addition to other enquiries in Japan and South Korea.
