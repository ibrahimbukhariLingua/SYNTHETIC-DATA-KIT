Solactive launches intuitive indices


Solactive announces the launch of the first Intuitive Beta™ Indices providing access to intuitive and easy-to-grasp investment concepts The new Solactive Intuitive Beta™ Indices constructed around intuitive themes such as workforce efficiency, corporate longevity and value investing are being rolled out. The Solactive Intuitive Beta™ is an innovative investment approach constituting the bedrock of a series of smart beta indices in which intuition, or gut feeling, takes a prominent role in defining the passive investment strategy. The first Intuitive Beta™ member is the Solactive Workforce Efficiency US Large Cap Index. The idea of creating a concept around workforce efficiency was incepted when thinking about what resources make a company outstanding. One of these is certainly its employees as human capital. Workforce efficiency is especially important in labor-intensive industries where the success of the firm mainly depends on its workforce, as opposed to capital-intensive industries where performance is more dependent on factors such as property, plant & equipment. The second Intuitive Beta™ newcomer is the Solactive P/E Ratio US Large Cap Index, an index made up of undervalued US companies, as measured by the P/E ratio. Last but not least, the Solactive US Established Companies Index selects the 100 oldest companies among US large caps. By investing in a basket of “time-proof” companies, where companies are on average 159 years old, investors can gain exposure to companies that have demonstrated resilience over time through repeated business cycles. Examples of constituents are Du Pont founded in 1802, Goldman Sachs in 1869 and Pfizer in 1849.
