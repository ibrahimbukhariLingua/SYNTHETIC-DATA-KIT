SYZ AM launches a new Oyster global multi-asset fund


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Syz Asset Management is launching the Oyster Multi-Asset Actiprotect fund, a flexible multi-asset fund which invests and takes on exposures to a wide range of asset classes, which in addition to liquidity, bonds (US Treasury 10 year and 30 year, UK Gilts, German and Italian government bonds), and equities (Europe, USA, Japan, United Kingdom, Switzerland, emerging markets), include currencies and precious metals (USD, JPY, GBP, AUD and gold). The objective for the fund is to earn returns over the long term comparable to two thirds of the global equity index (MSCI World CR EUR), with only one third of the risk (volatility of 5% to 7% per year). The exposure of the portfolio may vary between 0% and 130% and the fund will invest only in liquid instruments, such as futures, currency futures and ETP (maximum 10%). The ActiProtect strategy is based on a macroeconomic evaluation which determines an allocation for the assets desired, before making use of a dynamic allocation of the risk budget, complemented by dynamic coverage which aims to limit maximal losses to 10%. The fund is managed with a collaborative approach by Fabrizio Quirighetti (head), Guido Bolliger, Claude Cornioley and Adrien Pichoud, on the Multi-Asset team at SYZ Asset Management (Suisse) SA. Bolliger and Cornioley have recently joined SYZ Asset Management. Cornioley was previously a partner at Dynagest SA. Bolliger had been CIO at Olympia Capital, and before that, seved as senior quant analyst at Julius Baer.
