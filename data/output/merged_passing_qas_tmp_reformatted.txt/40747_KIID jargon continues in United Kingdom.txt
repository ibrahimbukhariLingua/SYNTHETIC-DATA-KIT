KIID jargon continues in United Kingdom


British investment advisers claim that most key investor information documents (KIID) are still too complex in their formulation, according to a survey carried out at the end of 2013, from 110 advisers. Most respondents, however, agree that the KIID is generally clearer and more concise than other fund documents. Since July 2013, the asset management sector will be required to offer investors information documents for UCITS funds which are formulated in “clear, succinct and comprehensible” language, and which avoid jargon. Many investment professionals have not yet been able to comply with the new requirements in Brussels.
