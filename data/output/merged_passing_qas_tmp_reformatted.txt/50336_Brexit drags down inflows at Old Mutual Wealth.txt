Brexit drags down inflows at Old Mutual Wealth


There has been a net slowdown in activities at Old Mutual Wealth. The asset management firm has posted net inflows of GBP900m in third quarter 2016, far from the GBP2.3bn in net subscriptions in third quarter 2015. The group explains, however, that “third quarter 2015 was exceptional due to pension fund reforms which resulted in high levels of net inflows in the United Kingdom.”Since the beginning of 2016, net inflows at Old Mutual Wealth have totalled GBP4.1bn, compared with GBP4.6bn in the same period of 2015. The British group contends that this slowdown is related “to the weakness of markets and continued uncertainty following the results of the British referendum on the European Union in June.”
