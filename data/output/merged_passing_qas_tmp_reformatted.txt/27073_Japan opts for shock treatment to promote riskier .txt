Japan opts for shock treatment to promote riskier assets


The Japanese government has launched a system of individual tax-exempt savings accounts (NISA) to encourage the population to save better and to invest, Les Echos reports. The government of Shinzo Abe wants to incite Japanese households to be more audacious with their savings, which have been sitting in bank accounts at interest rates of 0.02%. Of estimated total savings of EUR12trn, more than EUR6rn are currently tied up in bank or postal accounts. Only 12% of household savings are invested in the stock market or investment funds, according to the Bank of Japan.
