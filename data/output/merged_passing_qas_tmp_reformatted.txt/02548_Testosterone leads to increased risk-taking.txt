Testosterone leads to increased risk-taking


Testosterone plays an important role in financial risk aversion, according to a new study by the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business and Department of Comparative Human Development. Prior research has shown that the hormone, which is generally found in higher concentrations in men, enhances competitiveness and dominance, reduces fear, and is associated with risky behaviours such as gambling and alcohol use. However, until now, the impact of testosterone on gender difference in financial risk-taking had not been explored, according to the study, entitled “Gender differences in financial risk aversion and career choices are affected by testosterone.”The researchers found that higher levels of testosterone was related with a greater appetite for risk in women, but not among men. However, in men and women with similar levels of testosterone, the gender difference in risk aversion disappeared. In addition, the researchers reported that the relationship between risk aversion and testosterone predicted career choices after graduation: individuals with more testosterone and a lower risk aversion choose risker careers in finance.
