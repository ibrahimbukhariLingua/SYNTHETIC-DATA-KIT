iShares launches an ETF of international preferential equities


BlackRock has announced that its iShares division has launched the first ETF which allows investors access to preferential equities from developed countries outside the United States on the NYSE Arca platform. The fund is the iShares S&P International Preferred Stock Index Fund (acronym: IPFF), which is the international version of its US sibling, the iShares S&P U.S. Preferred Stock Index Fund (PFF), which has already attracted USD7.2bn in assets.The new product is aimed at investors seeking regular returns outside the US market. It replicates the S&P International Preferred Stock Index, a cap-weighted index, which is “rebalanced” every quarter. The heaviest exposures are currently to Canadian, British and New Zealand equities. The index has a strong bias in favour of the financial sector.
