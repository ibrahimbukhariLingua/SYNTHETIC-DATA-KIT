Groupama AM launches a fund eligible for short-term liquidity ratio


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Groupama AM is launching Groupama LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio), a fund eligible for the short-term liquidity ratio specified by the Basel III regulation. The ratio identifies a level of high quality, available and liquid assets, which may be used to confront a global short-term liquidity crisis (30 calendar days). Concretely, the new fund is a multi-asset class OPCVM which invests in the fixed income universe, 90% eligible for LCR. The fund is actively managed, and is composed of government bonds (excluding peripheral countries) and credit (excluding financial sector debt). To guarantee the desired levels of eligibility, Groupama LCR will adopt a highly prudential approach to its stock-picking. The complete transparency of the portfolio, materialised by specific LCR reporting, allows the client to consolidate the fund into calculation of the bankâ€™s global LCR levels, a statement says. The ISIN code for the new product is: FR0010213371 (part I).Benchmark index: EMTS Highest-Rated Gvt 1-3 year
