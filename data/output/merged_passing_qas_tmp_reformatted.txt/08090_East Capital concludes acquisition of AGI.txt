East Capital concludes acquisition of AGI


The Swedish asset management firm East Capital, a specialist in Eastern Europe markets, has concluded its acquisition of Asia Growth Investors, after being granted permission by the Swedish financial market authority. It now controls 100% of the management firm, which is also based in Stockholm, and which is focused on China. The acquisition will allow East Capital to extend its investment horizons, while remaining focused on emerging markets, and to add the EUR240m managed by AGI to its own EUR2.4bn in assets. As a part of the operation, Karine Hirn, a partner at East Capital, will move to Shanghai. She will aim to study the Chinese market, and eventually to strengthen AGI’s management teams. East Capital has also announced the appointment of Johan Björkstén as an advisor and member of the board of directors at AGI. Björkstén is the founder of Eastwei Relations, one of the largest communications agencies in China, which has more than 100 employees in four Chinese cities, and a client base composed of multinationals such as IKEA and Sony.
