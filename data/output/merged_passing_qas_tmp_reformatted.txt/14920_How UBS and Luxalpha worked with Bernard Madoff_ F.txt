How UBS and Luxalpha worked with Bernard Madoff: First revelations


In an internal document, UBS has described the operation of the Luxalpha Sicav, for which it was the depository, administrator and manager, an article in Les Echos reports. The newspaper says that the Operating Memorandum (OPMEM) for Luxalpha, the Sicav fund which had ties to the fraud scheme rigged up by Bernard Madoff, throws some light on the arrangements that upheld between the protagonists for the Luxembourg Sicav. The OPMEM clearly cites Bernard Madoff, who appears as a sub-depository of UBS Luxembourg.
