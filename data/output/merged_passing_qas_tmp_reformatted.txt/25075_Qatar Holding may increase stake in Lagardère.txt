Qatar Holding may increase stake in Lagardère


The Qatar Holding company has announced that it may increase its stake in Lagardère, but that it is not planning to take control of the group, the French market regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) announced in a statement on 3 January. The investment company has recently increased its stake in the firm above the 10% threshold in Lagardère SCA, making it the largest shareholder in the firm (see Newsmanagers of 30 December 2011). In a declaration of intent sent to the AMF, Qatar Holding adds that it is “planning to hold talks with all interested actors, over possible strategic partnerships to create long-term value for shareholders in the firm,” but states that it has no specific plans in this regard at present.
