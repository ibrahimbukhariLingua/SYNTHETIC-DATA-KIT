Sarasin bank launches a fund dedicated to US sustainable equities


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Banque Sarasin has announced the launch of a new equities fund, entitled Sarasin Sustainable Equity – USA. The fund is aimed at private as well as institutional investors, and allows them to participate in potential growth at US businesses which contribute to economic and social sustainability, the bank explains in a statement released on 18 October. In the past few years, the US government has passed stimulus measures to support sectors involved in sustainable development, such as clean and renewable energies and public transport. The Sarasin Sustainable Equity – USA fund was launched to capture the economic potential resulting from these incitements. With the density of US regulations increasing and tax regulations expected to toughen in the US, the fund, domiciled in Luxembourg, offers an attractive alternative for investors who prefer to avoid direct investment in US equities.
