Nexar Capital Group acquires Allianz Alternative Asset Management


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The alternative management firm Nexar Capital Group SCA, founded one year ago by former managers from SGAM AI, announced on 13 September that it has acquired Allianz Alternative Asset Management (AAAm) from Allianz France, its majority shareholder, and Allianz Global Investors Europe. The acquisition price was not disclosed. Since 1981, AAAm has offered its clients a full range of speculative funds of funds, led by Jean-François Vert, an expert in the sector, who will move to the Nexar platform along with the team from AAAm. The founding partners of Nexar, Arié Assayag CEO, and Eric Attias, CIO, have said that AAAm’s funds represent a valuable complement to the investment services of Nexar, and that the expertise of the European network of AAAm will come as an addition to the speculative fund of fund activities of Nexar, which are largely centred in New York. The strategic partnership which Nexar has concluded with the private equity firm Aquiline Capital Partners, based in New York, has put it in a position to act as a consolidator in the fragmented fund of fund sector. “We are happy that the strong point of the Nexar team in solutions which generate alpha will continue to be recognised; the collaboration between AAAm and Nexar confirms our opinion that the sector is ready for consolidation,” says Jeff Greenberg, CEO of Aquiline.
