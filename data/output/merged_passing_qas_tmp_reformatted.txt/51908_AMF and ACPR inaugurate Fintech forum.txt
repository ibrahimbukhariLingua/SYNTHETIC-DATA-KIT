This new forum body to provide consultation and dialogue with Fintech professionals aims to better apprehend the challenges of regulation and supervision related to financial technologies. The forum also aims to be a body for monitoring, dialogue and proposals to team up innovative companies, public bodies and supervisory authorities. “The Forum will allow us to better apprehend the challenges associated with the development of Fintechs, both in terms of opportunities and potential risks,” the AMF and ACPR say in a joint statement. The new structure may also be consulted for potential national or European projects to develop regulations or to amend AMF and ACPR doctrine. Lastly, the Forum may share information with supervisory authorities about subjects of concern to professionals. The body is composed of 34 members of the French Fintech industry (France Fintech, Yomoni, Advize, Wesave…), insurance (Axa, Groupama…), banking (Crédit Mutuel Arkéa, BNP Paribas…) participative financing (Lendix, KissKissBankBank…) and asset management (La Financière de l’Echiquier). These members have been appointed as “intuitu personae” and their term is for a period of two years, which can be renewed once. Experts may additionally be allocated to the work. Coordination will be provided jointly by the AMF and ACPR.
