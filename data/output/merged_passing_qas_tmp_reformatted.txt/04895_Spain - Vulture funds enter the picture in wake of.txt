Spain - Vulture funds enter the picture in wake of Madoff/Santander disaster


Expansi√≥n reports that vulture funds are planning to offer investors who fell victim to the Madoff fraud to buy up their shares at 22% of their nominal value, along with the right to take their place in legal proceedings against Santander and HSBC. The figure of 22% corresponds to the offer of reimbursement for damages made by Santander to shareholders in the Optimal US Equity fund. HSBC is named in the lawsuits because it was the depository bank for the funds.
