CFA Institute expresses reservations over financial transaction tax


The CFA Institute on 9 January expressed its reservations about the application and effectiveness of a tax on financial transactions in France. In a recent survey of members of the association in Europe, who are investment professionals, 48% consider the idea of a financial sector tax “justifiable,” while 49% consider it “unjustifiable.” “We are not against all taxation in principle, just because we’re working in the financial industry” says Agnès Le Thiec, director of capital market policies at the CFA Institute.However, Le Thiec continues, “44% of our members feel that a financial transaction tax would only be effective if it is applied at least to all G20 countries. Only 5% feel that it would be effective if applied in Europe, since financial transactions would move elsewhere.” It is therefore clear that if the tax were applied only in France, it would make even less sense.Such a tax would inevitably have negative consequences on the volume of activity in the French financial sector. “The revenues from such a tax would be quickly reduced by an equivalent proportion. It is therefore hard to see how a tax on financial transactions could be applied only in France, due to the global nature of the financial markets,” Le Thiec concludes.
