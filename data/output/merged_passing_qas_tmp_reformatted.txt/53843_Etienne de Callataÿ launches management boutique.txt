Etienne de Callataÿ launches management boutique


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The former economist in chief of Banque Degroof, which has become Degroof Petercam, is not staying out of the game for long. Etienne de Callataÿ, who left Degroof on 30 September last year in the wake of the merger between Banque Degroof and Petercam, has announced on the website of the newspaper Le Soir that he is launching his own asset management boutique, entitled Orcadia. He will be joined by three former colleagues in this adventure. Orcadia, based in Luxembourg, will offer management services with a social vision. “The name Orcadia refers to the Orkney islands in Scotland, which are viewed as a model of a sustainable economy, corresponding to our investment philosophy. It also lets us put a lighthouse in our logo: a lighthouse which lights the way,” the economist, who will also retain his teaching position at the University of Namur, explains to the Belgian newspaper.
