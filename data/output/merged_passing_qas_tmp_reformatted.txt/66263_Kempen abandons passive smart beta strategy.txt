Kempen abandons passive smart beta strategy


Kempen Capital Management (Kempen) has announced that it is discontinuing its smart beta passive strategy Fundamental Index, with four funds, including the Luxembourg-registered vehicles Kempen (Lux) Global Property Fundamental Index and Kempen (Lux) Global Sovereign Fundamental Index. The decision is strategic in nature, the Netherlands-based asset management firm says, and long active, as the firm seeks to focus more on investment solutions offered to clients. Kempen observes that clients are demanding added value not only in the current environment, but also in the future. Lars Dijkstra, chief investment officer at Kempen, explains that by maintaining a focus on active management, this added value can be passed on to clients, and that a solution will be found for investors in passive strategies from the asset management firm. Assets in the two Luxembourg-registered funds will be returned to investors in November 2018.
