One of the first UCITS IV funds closes


Nettle Capital has closed one of the first UCITS IV funds ever launched, after barely one year in existence, due to the excessively small volume of assets, FundWeb reports. The TB Nettle European Micro Cap fund was launched in November 2012, with the objective of raising GBP20m, but it received only a tenth of the target investment volume.
