Funds of hedge funds sell off their hedge fund shares


Hedgebay, a trading platform for shares in hedge funds, reports that the number of offers to sell have increased 20% in first quarter, and that no transactions have taken place at liquid value or higher, the Wall Street Journal states. In March, these shares were selling at an average of 20% below their value, compared with 15% below in February. Permal, an affiliate of Legg Mason, in November created the Hedge Fund Opportunities fund, to acquire shares in hedge funds from investors seeking to exit from their investments before the next liquidity window. SecondMarket, which trades in all types of illiquid assets, in February began trading in shares in private equity firms and hedge funds. Also in February, Tullett Prebon, an interdealer broker, set up a desk dedicated to this market.
