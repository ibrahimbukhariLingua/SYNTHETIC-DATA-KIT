Deutsche Bank places emphasis on HNWIs and ETFs


Michele Faissola, head of the asset and wealth management (AWM) unit at Deutsche Bank, on Wednesday announced that its affiliate DWS is seeking to increase the number of its funds which receive top ratings by 15-20%. A cost savings programme announced by the bank on Tuesday (single strategy, shared IT and distribution) is expected to generate cost reductions of EUR700m for AWM, Die Welt reports.Growth will come primarily through development of the ultra-high net worth client segment (clients with financial savings of over EUR70m), particularly in Asia, and ETFs. Its affiliate db x-trackers, which has been detached from the investment bank and is now part of the AWM unit, will no longer be limited to Europe, where it has EUR35bn in assets under management, but will release its products worldwide. The US market will significantly contribute to a 50% increase in volume in three years.
