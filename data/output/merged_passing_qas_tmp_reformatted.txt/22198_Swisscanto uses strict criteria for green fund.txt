Swisscanto uses strict criteria for green fund


At a presentation in Paris, Gerhard Wagner, a member of the board at Swisscanto and senior portfolio manager for sustainable investments, stated that the Swiss asset management firm employs very strict exclusionary criteria for its four Green Invest funds, which have a total of about CHF2bn in assets (out of total assets at the firm of CHF53bn as of the end of March). The list of activities excluded includes businesses involved in the promotion of fossil energy sources, those who operate carbon or nuclear electrical plants, automobile makers and airlines, forestry businesses not focused on sustainable development, businesses involved in the production of weapons or tobacco, businesses involved in genetic engineering, and makers of PVC and vinyl chloride. Lastly, businesses in the gambling sector are not excluded as a whole, but donâ€™t pass a ratings filter. The equity fund Swiss Canto (LU) Equity Fund Water Invest J (LU0302977094), launched on 18 September 2007, has posted performance since its inception of 0.06% per year, compared with losses of 1.01% p.a. for the MSCI World index, which meets the objective of outperforming the index, despite rigorous selection. The fund (50 holdings out of a universe of 200 eligible shares) had total assets of CHF105.82m as of the end of March. It is 70% invested in small caps and 25% in large caps, with overweight positions on utilities and industrials. Wagner states that the porftfolio is one third each invested in infrastructure, utilities and companies active in water conservation.
