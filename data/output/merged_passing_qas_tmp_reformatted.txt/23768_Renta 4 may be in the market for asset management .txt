Renta 4 may be in the market for asset management firm acquisitions


Juan Carlos Ureta, CEO, has announced at a presentation of the bank’s 2011 results (see article in today’s Newsmanagers) that Renta4 is an ideal candidate to acquire asset management firms, both in Spain and in Latin America, Funds People reports. The manager says that he has already studied several potential acquisitions, including those of the Spanish savings banks’ arena. Renta 4 is hoping to be a player in the reorganisation of the asset management sector, an area which offers many opportunities because it is fragmented and many actors do not have the necessary critical mass.
