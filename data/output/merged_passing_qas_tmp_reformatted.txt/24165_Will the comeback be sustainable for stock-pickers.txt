Will the comeback be sustainable for stock-pickers?


The Wall Street Journal reports that 70% of stock-pickers outperformed the S&P 500 index in January, while less than a quarter of them did so for 2011 as a whole. A few weeks are not enough to identify a sustainable trend, but the markets have been more stable, and equities are less correlated, which works to the advantage of asset managers who focus on fundamentals at businesses rather than on market momentum or consensus.If these asset managers continue to outperform, which would justify the higher commissions they charge, many financial advisers are in danger of finding themselves on a back foot, having recommended tracker funds or ETFs to their clients. And most of these advisers recommend caution, as they suspect that the high returns will not last.
