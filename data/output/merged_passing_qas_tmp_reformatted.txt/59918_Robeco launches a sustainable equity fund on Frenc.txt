Robeco launches a sustainable equity fund on French market


Robeco on 19 July announced that it has received permission from the regulator to sell its Robeco QI Global Sustainable Conservative Equities fund on the French market. The vehicle, domiciled in Luxembourg, was officially launched in close collaboration with the sustainable investment specialist RobecoSAM in December 2016. At the time, the fund was pending a license for France (see NewsManagers of 20 December 2016). The fund aims to generate the best returns possible by exploiting a low volatility anomaly possible on equity markets, while controlling for risk in periods of falling market, the asset management firm explains in a statement. The fund “aims to offer a far superior sustainability profile to its benchmark index, the MSCI World All Country,” Robeco adds. The fund is managed by the Robeco Conservative Equities team, based in Rotterdam, which oversees EUR19.7bn in assets under management as of the end of March 2017. RobecoSAM co-developed the strategy, and is responsible for integrating Smart ESG (environment, social and governance) criteria to reduce the environmental footprint of the fund by 20% (compared with the MSCI World All Country index), and to avoid investment in businesses with controversial practices. The vehicle is aimed both at instiututional and at retail investors.
