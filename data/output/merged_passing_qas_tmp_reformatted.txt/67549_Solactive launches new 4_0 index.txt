Solactive launches new 4.0 index


Solactive has announced the launch of the Solactive Industry 4.0 Index, an index tracking the performance of companies that are operating in any of the following segments: Advanced Robotics, Augmented Reality & 3D Printing, Cloud & Big Data, Cyber Security and Internet of Things (IoT) (together the “Index Categories”). From each of the five index categories the index selects the top 10 companies based on the market capitalization and/or their R&D to Sales ratio. Each of the five index categories and their individual components are weighted equally.Industry 4.0 is the interconnection and total automatization of a factory towards an autonomous machine economy in which machines interact with each other without human intervention. With 3D printing, fabrication of components becomes much more flexible, cost effective, distributed, and on-demand. Augmented Reality can speed up the production chain and has a significant impact on the maintenance cost. Cloud solutions and Big Data build the foundation of Industry 4.0 and allow real-time communications for production systems as well as real-time decision-making support and optimization. The IoT is the monitoring tool to control and access infrastructure across the network. In this connected world cyber security is a key factor for a truly automated industry.
