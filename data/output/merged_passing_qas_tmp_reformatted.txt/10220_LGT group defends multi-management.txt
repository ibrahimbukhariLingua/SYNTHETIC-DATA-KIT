LGT group defends multi-management


Prince Max of Liechtenstein, CEO of LGT Group, has defended multi-management in an interview with Asian Investor. There have been outflows from multi-management funds, the prince admits, “but we are convinced that multi-management funds are the best approach in terms of diversification of risks,” he says. However, the head continues, in order to carry out such a strategy, experience and specialists on location are needed. “You need to have partners in New York to understand the funds based there, and in China you need to have people that speak Mandarin in order to understand some of the strategies used by hedge funds specialised in China.” In passive management, the CEO claims that ETFs “may be useful for short-term trading strategies. But what they can’t do, and precisely what we offer, is to provide due diligence on fund managers. We are able to identify active managers and generate long-term value, but the trouble is that the mentality of many asset managers is short-term and tactical,” he explains. The group will this year celebrate 25 years of being active in the region, where it has about USD10bn in assets under management.
