Investors remain prudent, with an average of 5% cash in August, compared with 4.7% the previous month, but at the same time, they show a marked preference for US equities, according to the latest Fund Manager Survey from BofA Merrill Lynch, carried out between 3 and 9 August, covering a sample of 243 participants with cumulative assts of USD735bn. Allocations dedicated to US equities increased by 10 percentage points, for a net overweight position of 19%, the largest since January 2015.For the first time in five years, the United States are considered the most favourable refion for investment in equities. When asked about regional outlooks for corporate profits, 67% of investors think that the United States are the most favourable region, a level not seen in 17 years.In terms of major risks, the spectre of trade war is cited most often by investors (57%) for the third consecutive month, far ahead of tightening of monetary policy (15%) and a slowdown in the Chinese economy (14%). On the subject of disassociation of the global economy, respondents are divided: 34% feel that the situation will persist, while 32% predict that the US economy will decelerate, and 28% feel that Europe and Asia will see an acceleration of conjuncture.“Concerns about growing leverage at businesses indicate that bonds are expected to outperform equities, while the decline in profits suggests that defensive stocks will outperform cyclical ones,” comments Michael Hartnett, chief strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch. “With investors telling us that they are long on the United States, the Fed and cash, our point of view remains that profits, politics and returns are at their peak.”
