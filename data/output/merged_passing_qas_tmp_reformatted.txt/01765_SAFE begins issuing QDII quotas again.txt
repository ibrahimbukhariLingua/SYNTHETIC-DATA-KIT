SAFE begins issuing QDII quotas again


On Friday, the Chinese State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) assigned its first QDII quotas in 17 months, for USD1bn to E-Fund and USD500m to China Merchants, who will be allowed to launch an Asia ex Japan fund and a “global resources” fund, respectively, consulting firm Z-Ben Advisors reports. According to the consultant, four other new quotas may be issued by SAFE by the end of the year to Changsheng, Bosera, UBS SDIC and China Universal. Z-Ben Advisors also reports that a new fund may be expected to be launched every three weeks until the end of the year, while SAFE is also likely to issue new quotas worth USD4bn, of which USD3bn will be for foreign markets.
