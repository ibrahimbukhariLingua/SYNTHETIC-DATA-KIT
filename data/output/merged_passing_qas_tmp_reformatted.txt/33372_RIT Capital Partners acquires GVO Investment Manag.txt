RIT Capital Partners acquires GVO Investment Management


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; }a:link { } RIT Capital, an investment trust based and listed in London and led by Lord Rothschild, with over GBP2bn under management, has reached an agreement to acquire GVO Investment Management Limited (GVOIM) from Hansa Aktiengesellschaft. The GVOIM company, based in London, with about GBP350m in assets, was acquired last year by the Swiss company Hansa. GVOIM invests in British equities, applying techniques specific to private equity. It manages the GVO UK Focus Fund, an investment vehicle domiciled in Ireland, and Strategic Equity Capital, an investment trust listed in London. After the operation, GVOIM will continue to operate as a separate legal entity, with the same management team, the same structure, and the same investment processes. “There will be no change to the management teams, which will retain their complete investment autonomy,” RIT Capital Partners says in a statement.
