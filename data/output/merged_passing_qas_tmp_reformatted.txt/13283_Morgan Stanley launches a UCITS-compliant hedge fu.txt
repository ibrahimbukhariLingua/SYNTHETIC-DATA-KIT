Morgan Stanley launches a UCITS-compliant hedge fund with Cohen &amp; Steers


Morgan Stanley has released a new sub-fund of its Irish Sicav FundLogic Alternatives Plc entitled MS Cohen & Steers Global Real Estate L/S Fund, which deploys a long/short strategy for listed real estate. The UCITS-compliant hedge fund will be managed by Todd Voigt at Cohen & Steers Capital Management Inc (USD40bn in assets). According to the manager, 95% of the portfolio, which complies with the UCITS III directive, exactly reproduces the corresponding offshore product. The minor difference of 5% is the result of adaptation to European standards.
