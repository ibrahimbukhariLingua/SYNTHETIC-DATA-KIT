Fidelity recruits a top name from DWS


Fidelity International Germany on Tuesday announced that it has recruited Andreas Feiden, head of DWS Direkt (Deutsche Bank group), as a member of the general board at the German-registered management firm (KAG) FIL Investment Management GmbH, in charge of retail clients. He will also simultaneously take over as director of direct distribution. Feiden, who takes over the position vacated by Alexander Judkings in May, will join Fidelity by the end of the year. He will report to Christian Wrede, CEO of Fidelity International for Germany and managing director for Central Europe. The recruitment of Feiden is a sign that Fidelity Germany, which aims to be a multi-channel operator, has decided to directly attack the retail market, without neglecting institutional clients, IFAs, commercial banks, savings banks, insurers, wealth managers, or family offices.
