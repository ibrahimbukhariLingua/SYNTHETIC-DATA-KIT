Edlinger joins from Coutts, where he had spent more than 20 years, most recently as head of portfolio management for ultra high net worth clients. As part of his last position at Coutts, he was responsible for investments in discretionary and advised portfolios internationally, both onshore and offshore, in all asset classes and geographical regions. The arrival comes a few days after the appointment of Michael Le Garignon as head of independent asset managers in the United Kingdom.
