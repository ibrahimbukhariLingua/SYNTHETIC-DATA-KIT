Lyxor launches two new classes of equities on FTSE 100


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Lyxor ETF on 1 August announced the launch of two new share classes, Lyxor Ucits ETF FTSE 100 – Monthly Hedged C-EUR and Lyxor Ucits ETF FTSE 100 – Monthly Hedged C-USD, which for the first time offer European investors exposure to the FTSE 100 in rising and falling markets, while reducing currency risks related to a decline in the pound sterling. “These recent innovations come in the wake of the British vote in favour of an exit from the European Union, causing a drop in the pound sterling: -8.53% against the euro, and -11.12% against the US dollar since 23 June 2016, while the FTSE 100 index has posted gains of 6.55% in the same period,” Lyxor says in a statement. According to the research teams at Lyxor Asset Management, a weak currency and an accommodating position on the part of the Bank of England will be likely to favour British international equities (which are strongly represented in the FTSE 100) to the detriment of equities which are oriented to the domestic market (more strongly represented in the FTSE 250). “About 70% of sales made by companies of the FTSE 100 are outside the UK and are denominated in foreign currencies,” Lyxor says. Through the creation of these two asset classes, Lyxor ETF is extending its range for investors seeking coverage against GBP/EUR and GBP/USD currency risks related to further potential depreciations of the pound sterling. “The two share classes, which have a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.30%, offer simple and inexpensive exposure to British equities, both for investors in US dollars and in euros,” Lyxor states. The new ETFs come as additions to the existing international, European and Japanese product range hedged against currency risks.
