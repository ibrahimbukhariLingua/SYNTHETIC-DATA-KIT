Global X ETF launches an ETF of the fishing industry


With the Global X Fishing Industry ETF (acronym: FISN), which charges fees of 0.69%, Global X has launched what it claims is the first ETF ever dedicated to the global fishing industry. The fund replicates the Solactive Global Fishing Index, in which the three largest components as of 29 April were Cermaq ASA, Marine Harvest, and Toyo Suisan Kaisha Ltd. The two major branches of the fishing industry are commercial fishing and aquaculture.
