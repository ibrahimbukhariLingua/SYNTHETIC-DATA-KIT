Madoff liquidator accuses Fairfield Greenwich of complicity


Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee in charge of liquidating of Bernard Madoff’s business interests, on Friday accused Fairfield Greenwich Group, which was thought to have been the largest purveyor of funds into the fraud, of having had concrete knowledge of the Ponzi scheme being operated by Madoff, the Wall Street Journal reports. The trustee is seeking to recuperate about USD7bn from Fairfield Greenwich, where he says 19 people and 25 affiliates at the firm actively participated in Bernard Madoff’s fraud, by misleading investors and deliberately ignoring indicators of fraud, with the aim of personal enrichment.
