Thierry Callault announces new developments at Quaero Capital


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Things are changing; things are staying the same. The Geneva-based asset management firm Argos Investment Managers, founded in 2005 by Christopher Gelli and Philip Best under the name Argos Investment Managers, with Thierry Callault as chief development officer and Jean Keller as CEO, has announced a change of legal format and name, to become Quaero Capital SA. This new name is the result of a desire on the part of the asset mangement firm «to develop in new sectors and to ensure its future development by way of a unique brand on all markets,” it says in a statement. The former Argos IM, which has CHF600m in assets under management, with 27 employees in 4 offices in Europe (Geneva, Zurich, Paris and London), positions itself as a specialist asset management boutique, concentrated on a range of high-conviction strategies, each of them based on fundamental research and original thinking in the area of investment. Quaero Capital, dedicated to the needs of European institutionals seeking diversification and new investment themes, now offers a range of 12 strategies, available via segregated mandates or investment funds. The funds are incorporated into two Luxembourg-registered SICAV umbrella funds (one Part I UCITS fund and one SIF).
