Schroders launches a multi-factoral international equity fund


Schroders has announced the launch of the Global Multi-Factor Equity fund, a diversified investment strategy which aims for significant outperformance in a controlled risk environment. The systematic factoral investment process may be an appropriate solution for the needs of defined-contribution pension plans, Schroders estimates in a statement. The fund implements a bottom-up investment approach, which is based on stock-picking on the basis of several factors, including quality, momentum, value, low volatility and small caps. The fund, which charges fees of 24 basis points, seeks to outperform the MSCI All Country World index over the long term. It will be managed by the Advanced Beta team at Schroders, created in 2013, which has GBP4.3bn in assets under management.
