BlackRock appoints a new head of alternative management


A whirlwind has swept through the head offices at BlackRock. The US asset management firm has fired its management team, and appointed a new head for its alternative management activity, according to an internal document obtained by Reuters. Mark McCombe has abandoned his position as global head of the alternative division (BlackRock Alternative Investors) to concentrate exclusively on directing the Americas division. At the head of BlackRock Alternative Investors, McCombe will be replaced by David Blumer, formerly of Credit Suisse, who joined BlackRock in 2013, and had previously served as head of the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. In the wake of these changes, Rachel Lord has been appointed as head of the EMEA region, replacing Blumer. Lord had previously been head of iShares for the EMEA region, and head of the index-based asset management activity. She is replaced by Stephen Cohen, who becomes the new head of iShares for the EMEA region, the internal document states.
