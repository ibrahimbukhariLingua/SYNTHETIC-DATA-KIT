Increase in ETF allocations motivated by cost


Cost considerations appear to be the main driver of increases in allocations to ETFs, a recent study undertaken by Edhec-Risk of 180 European ETF users has found. The survey was carried out by the Amundi ETF, Indexing and Smart beta chair. 80% of respondents report that increases in ETF exposure are motivated by cost, far ahead of performance (50%), transparency (46%) and liquidity (45%). Nearly 60% of ETF users would consider increasing their use of ETFs, a level which remains stable since 2011. More than one third of respondents (35%) will retain their level of exposure. Only 5% are planning to reduce it. The level of satisfaction of investors with ETFs remains high, particularly for traditional asset classes. Equity ETFs now enjoy a satisfaction rate of 98%, compared with 91% in 2014. Concerning smart beta, investors have increased their exposure to ETFs using this concept. 68% now use them, compared with only 49% in 2014. 38% hope for future developments in this area. 75% of respondents think that smart beta indices offer significant potential for outperformance of cap-weighted indices over the long term. But 94% feel that smart beta indices require total transparency about methodology and risk analysis.
