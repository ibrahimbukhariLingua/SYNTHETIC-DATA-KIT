Lazard plans Swiss office


Jean-Jacques de Gournay, managing partner at Lazard Frères Gestion, has announced in an interview with L’Agefi Suisse that a location in Switzerland is a priority objective for Lazard. “We are planning to develop in private wealth management in Europe. For the moment, we are highly present in France, and we created a structure in Spain a few months ago. In the short term, we would like to open an office in Switzerland. However, it is not our intention to do it quickly. We want to avoid the start-and-go approach which is popular among many Anglo-American firms. When we arrive somewhere, we stay a long time. We need to find someone who is both a developer and a manager, which is a difficult mission,” de Gournay explains to the Swiss newspaper. Asset management last year generated 43% of revenues for the group, returning to the level it had enjoyed in the early years of the last decade.
