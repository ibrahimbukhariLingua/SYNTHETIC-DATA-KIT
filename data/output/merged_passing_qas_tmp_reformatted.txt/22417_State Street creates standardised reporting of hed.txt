State Street creates standardised reporting of hedge fund risks


State Street Corporation has created a protocol to standardise collection and transfer of risk information concerning hedge funds, entitled Open Protocol Enabling Risk Aggregation (OPERA). In combinatino with the TruView risk management platform, OPERA allows institutional investors to analyse their risks more exhaustively and to have a stable reporting framework for each of their hedge fund investments. The new protocol was developed in concert with a working group in which major hedge fund managers and institutional investors were represented. State Street states that as of 31 March, it had about USD895bn in alternative assets under management.
