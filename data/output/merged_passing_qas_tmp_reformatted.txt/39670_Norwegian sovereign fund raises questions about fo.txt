Norwegian sovereign fund raises questions about fossil fuels


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Norway will debate whether its sovereign fund (USD840bn) should stop to invest in businesses in the oil, gas and coal sectors, the Financial Times reports. The two centre-right parties in power and two of their allies have agreed to set up a group of experts which will study investments by the Norwegian fund in fossil fuels. The debate began when the opposition labour party last autumn proposed that the oil fund might sell off its investments in coal. Three out of the 10 largest positions in the fund are Royal Dutch Shell, BG Group and BP (as of 30 September), the FT notes.
