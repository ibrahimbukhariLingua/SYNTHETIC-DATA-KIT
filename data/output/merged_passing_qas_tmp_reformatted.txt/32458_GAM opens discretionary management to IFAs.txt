GAM opens discretionary management to IFAs


The British asset management firm GAM on 11 February announced that it is extending its discretionary fund management (DFM) range to British independent financial advisers (IFAs), which will allow this category of clients access ot its asset allocation and manager selection expertise. The new product, Model Portfolio Service (MPS), consists of five profiled strategies according to the risk/return profile, ranging from capital preservation to total participation in equity markets. Investors can select volatility fields from personalised collective accounts (PCA), platforms and managed accounts. According to GAM, the PCA formula stands out from other existing multi-managed collective vehicles on the market as it offers cost-effective access to model portfolios in the form of funds, and uses a segregated portfolio without sacrificing detailed reporting. Additionally, the solution based on an account does not limit the possible number of portfolio readjustments for available asset classes; additionally, PCA is exempt from VAT.The MPS range is specifically designed to satisfy growing demand from IFAs for investment outsourcing products, following the introduction of the Retail Distribution Review (RDR). GAM has also added to its managed portfolio unit last year, with the recruitment of Charles Hepworth as investment director, and James McDaid as investment manager.See attached.
