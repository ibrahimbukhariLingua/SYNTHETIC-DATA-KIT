UAW fund seeking managers for its USD45bn reserves


The United Auto Workersâ€™ union (UAW) has built up a USD45bn war chest through its agreement to participate in bailout efforts to save the three major US auto makers, the Wall Street Journal reports. The VEBA (Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association) has already placed USD2.2bn with BlackRock, and has launched requests for proposals for the management of international equities and bond mandates. The objective is to render the assets more conservative and liquid, by reducing allocation to alternative investments, which include USD2bn in five hedge funds, USD380m in shares in realty firms, and USD375m in private equity.
