Actiam excludes companies with ties to coal


The Netherlands-based asset management firm Actiam, a specialist in socially responsible investment, on 3 May announced that with immediate effect, it has decided to exclude companies which operate coal mines from its full investment portfolio and funds. The objective of the asset management firm is to come into line with the climate agreement signed in Paris under COP 21. Actiam will cease to invest in companies which earn more than 15% of their earnings from coal mining. Via an active shareholder engagement policy, Actiam seeks to incite other companies, including those which earn less than 15% of their earnings from coal-related activities, to contribute more to the energy transition.
