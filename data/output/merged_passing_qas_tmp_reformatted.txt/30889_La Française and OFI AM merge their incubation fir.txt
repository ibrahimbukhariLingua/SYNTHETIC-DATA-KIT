La Française and OFI AM merge their incubation firms


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } La Française and OFI AM have entered exclusive talks to study a merger of their two incubation units, NExT AM and New Alpha AM, the two French asset management firms announced on Monday. More precisely, NExT AM, a wholly-owned subsidiary of La Française, would buy a stake in NewAlpha AM, which is 65% controlled by OFI AM and 35% by its employees. The size of the stake is not yet known, but “we would be a major shareholder,” says Nicolas Duban, chairman of NExT AM, in an interview with Newsmangers. OFI AM would sell a part of its shares. The objective is to operationally merge the two firms and “create a European leader in incubation,” a press statement says. The structure would have about EUR7bn in assets under management by incubated firms. NExT AM currently represents the majority of these assets, with EUR4bn. The incubation activity of La Française, made an affiliate in 2012, but active for 10 years, primarily covers long-only management. It has distinguished itself for its stakes in Métropole Gestion, Mandarine Gestion, Acropole… and currently holds 20 stakes in asset management and consulting firms. NewAlpha AM, for its part, covers alternative management, with about USD3.2bn with 12 managers in incubation. Specialised in fee-sharing, it also has a license as an asset management firm. This complementarity is one of the strengths and motivations of the merger. The other is to capitalise on size effects in order to attempt to achieve a position as a major international player dedicated entirely to international incubation. The closing of the deal is expected before July.
