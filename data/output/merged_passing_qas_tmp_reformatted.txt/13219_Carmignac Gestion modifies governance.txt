Carmignac Gestion modifies governance


Agefi reports that Eric Le Coz, a member of the investment committee and supervisor of the risk, reporting and product engineering departments at Carmignac Gestion since 2007, has been appointed as deputy CEO.Le Coz will coordinate the management team, alongside Edouard Carmignac, founder and president of the firm, and will work to define performance objectives and improve risk analysis methodology for products, but will not influence the strategies and convictions of the managers, the firm says.The promotion of Le Coz may also reassure observers who were concerned that the management firm had become too dependent on its president, the newspaper notes. At 63, Carmignac is co-manager of Carmignac Patrimoine, and the sole manager of Carmignac Investissement, the firmâ€™s two largest funds. The management firm has suffered from a fall in returns for its flagship funds, and in first half 2011 saw outflows of EUR4.67bn from French-registered funds.
