Silk Road Management launches two Iraq indices


The asset management firm Silk Road Management, specialised in Mongolia and other countries rich in natural resources, has launched two indices dedicated to Iraq, the Silk Road Iraq Index (Silkiq) and Silk Road Iraq Oil Index (Silkio), both of which include the largest companies involved in Iraq traded on the Iraq Stock Exchange (ISX), and the London, Toronto and Oslo stock exchanges. The Silk Road Iraq Index includes 26 companies with a market capitalisation of USD12.8bn (as of 1 January 2012). The other index, the Silk Road Iraq Oil Index, includes seven major oil and gas groups operating in Iraq, with a capitalisation as of the beginning of this year of USD9.6bn. The Silkio index has risen 24% in January, while the Silkiq gained 14% in the same period. Alisher Ali, managing partner at Silk Road Management, says Iraq and Mongolia are by far “two particularly attractive frontier markets currently and for the next few years.” In 2011, the Iraqi stock exchange gained 35%, he points out.
