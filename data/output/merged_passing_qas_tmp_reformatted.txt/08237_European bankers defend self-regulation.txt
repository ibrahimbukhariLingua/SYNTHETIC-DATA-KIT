European bankers defend self-regulation


Ahead of the publication of proposals by the European Commission to regulate over-the-counter derivative markets, the european banking federation (EBF) on 3 June published a document which lays out the banking communityâ€™s common viewpoint in this area. The association continues to admit the advantages of centralized compensation in reducing counterparty risks, but adds that centralised clearing should be left to the initiative of the market, and points out that increased collateralisation in bilateral compensation is also an essential element to take into account in order to reduce counterparty risks.
