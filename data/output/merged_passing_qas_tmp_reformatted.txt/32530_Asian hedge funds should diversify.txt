Asian hedge funds should diversify


Despite the challenges presented by the current environment, Asian hedge fund managers should continue to invest capital and get involved in new strategies, according to BNY Mellon. Hedge fund management firms with a reputation in the market will attract moderate inflows from their traditional investors, as US insitutionals and newcomers turn to ultra-high net worth investors and family offices, says Aidan Houlihan, managing director of alternative investment services at BNY Mellon. Fund launches are expected to be fewer in the next few months, which would not prevent Asian hedge fund managers from exploring new strategies. Coe managers already offer highly sophisticated macro or credit strategies, as well as multi-strategy funds. Long/short funds still represent about 75% of assets in hedge funds, down from 90% a few years ago.
