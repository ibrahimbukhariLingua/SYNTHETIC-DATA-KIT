Nordea releases a fund of safe govies


The former Euro Government Bond Fund sub-fund of the Luxembourg Sicav Nordea 1, renamed on 23 December as Nordea 1- European Low CDS Government Bond Fund, is now on sale in France. It is a UCITS-compliant fund of European government bonds considered the “safest,” as investments are allocated depending on the rising credit risks for markets as observed in CDS spreads. Nordea claims this approach is more realistic than the one based on evaluation by ratings agencies, although this latter formula is currently by far the dominant one.Management commission has been reduced by 30 basis points for the retail share class,a dn 15 basis points for the institutional share class, compared with the initial fund.The portfolio is invested in securities selected on the basis of a rolling 3-month average of their 5-year CDS spreads, as listed on Credit Market Analysis (CMA). The fund is managed by Martti Forsberg, the European government specialist on the international bonds team.CharacteristicsName: Nordea 1- European Low CDS Government Bond FundISIN codes:LU0634509953 (BP share class, retail)LU0637308585 (BI share class, institutional)Front-end fee: 5%Management fees:0.50% (BP share class)0.25% (BI share class)Minimal subscriptionEUR50 (BP share class)EUR75,000 (BI share class)
