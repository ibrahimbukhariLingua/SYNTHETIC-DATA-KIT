IOSCO publishes principles on management of mutual fund liquidity risks


The International Organization of Securities Commissions published on March 4 the final report on Principles of Liquidity Risk Management for Collective Investment Schemes, which contains a set of principles against which both the industry and regulators can assess the quality of regulation and industry practices concerning liquidity risk management for collective investment schemes (CIS).Since the outbreak of the global financial crisis, the issue of liquidity has been a major concern for regulators. However, the discussions on regulatory reform have tended to focus more on the importance of liquidity in the banking sector than in other sectors. These principles have been designed to address the specificities of liquidity risk management in the context of the operation of a CIS.To deal with the exceptional circumstances where a liquidity problem may lead a CIS to temporarily suspend all investor redemptions, IOSCO has published, in January 2012, a report on Principles on Suspensions of Redemptions in Collective Investment Schemes.
