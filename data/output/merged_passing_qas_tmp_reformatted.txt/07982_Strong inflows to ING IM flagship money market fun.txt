Strong inflows to ING IM flagship money market fund


The AAA-rated flagship money market fund from ING Investment Management ING (L)Liquid Euro has seen about EUR800m in inflows since the beginning of the year, and now has about EUR4bn in assets, says Vincent Juvyns, money market strategist at ING IM. Juvyns admits, however, that the fund, which has about half of all assets in ING IM money market funds, is not representative of all its strategies, as some funds have also seen redemptions, particularly in Belgium. The Liquid, however is aimed at institutional and industrial clients, who are more attentive than ever to preservation of capital and returns, as well as liquidity. The fund maintains a permanent minimum cash allocation of 20%, while also limiting the percentage of less liquid assets in the portfolio. Meanwhile, the fund has a diversified presence both in terms of clients (businesses, institutionals, and pension funds) and of regions, with about EUR1.5bn from Belgium, but also about EUR1bn from the Netherlands, and EUR800m from France.
