The online financial services provider Swissquote is adding to its product range with the launch of the Swiss Derivatives OTC Trading System (Swiss DOTS). The new service is being offered in partnership with two banks: Goldman Sachs and UBS, Swissquote says in a statement released on 23 May. From today, on the Swissquote platform, several thousands of derivative products and warrants may be traded directly with issuing banks, the online bank announced in a statement on Wednesday. The range may grow to as many as 20,000 products by the end of the year, Swissquote says. The products, available exclusively on the Swissquote platform, will be available for trading directly with issuing partners Monday to Friday from 8 AM to 10 PM.
