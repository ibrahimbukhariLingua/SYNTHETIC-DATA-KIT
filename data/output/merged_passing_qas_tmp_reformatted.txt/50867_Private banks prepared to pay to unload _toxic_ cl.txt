Private banks prepared to pay to unload “toxic” clients


At private banks, some clients have become so toxic that firms are prepared to pay those who may potentially take them over, Le Temps reports. After the end of banking secrecy and a US offensive against tax fraud, some clients are no longer worth anything in the wealth management market – for example, Americans, and undeclared Europeans. A ‘selling’ bank may be content to give these clients to an acquirer for free. It is sometimes the case that clients are worth less than nothing on the market, and the firm which wishes to unload them then has to pay an acquirer.After selling some clients to Union bancaire privée (UBP) last year, Coutts is now seeking to unload a portfolio of clients, according to several sources who have consulted the case. The Leumi bank was in a similar situation last year, after being taken over by Julius Baer in 2014. The sellers are generally firms which are seeking to stop their activities in Switzerland, explains Jean-François Lagassé, a partner at Deloitte in Switzerland, not citing any particular cases. “Some banks have residual portfolios, which they are not able to sell, and which slow down the liquidation process.” Paying someone to take over clients that nobody wants is “even good business for the buyer, who is assured of immediate growth in assets and at an attractive price,” says Lagassé. Six cases of this type have recently been seen on the Geneva market. All of them found ‘buyers.’
