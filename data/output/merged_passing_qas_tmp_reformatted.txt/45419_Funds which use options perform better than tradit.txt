Funds which use options perform better than traditional funds


Funds which make use of options in their portfolio management show better returns than traditional funds, according to a study by the Chicago Board Option Exchange. The study focuses on analysis of investment companies which are regulated by the SEC, mutual funds, ETFs and closed-ended funds (CEF) which use publicly-traded options in their portfolio management.Funds which use options have increased in number from 12 in 2000 to 119 last year. The study selected the three quarters of them which used options on US equity indices, and/or options on equity indices in the period from 2000 to 2014. These funds show risk-adjusted returns, measured by the Sharpe or Sortino ratios, which are higher than those for the S&P 500 and S&P GSCI indices.Another finding is that funds which use options have lower volatility and maximal drawdowns than those observed for the S&P 500 and S&P GSCI indices.
