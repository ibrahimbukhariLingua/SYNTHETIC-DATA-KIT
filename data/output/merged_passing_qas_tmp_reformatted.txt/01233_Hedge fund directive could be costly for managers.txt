Hedge fund directive could be costly for managers


The European Commission’s proposal to tighten regulation on hedge funds and private-equity funds could cost asset managers EUR22 billion in one-time charges and almost EUR4 billion in annual charges, according to an impact assessment published Monday by the European Parliament’s directorate general for internal policies and cited by the WSJ. It could slow economic growth in the European Union by 0.2 percentage point a year.
