Temasek reduces exposure to major Chinese banks


The Singapore sovereign fund Temasek Holdings on Wednesday resold shares in Bank of China and China Construction Bank for USD3.62bn, at 6% and 3.4% below their closing prices on Tuesday, respectively, the Wall Street Journal reports. Temasek says that it is a simple rebalancing of its portfolio, rather than a negative prediction as to the Chinese banks, but the poor performance of the shares is a sign that investors are concerned about the portfolio of credits to Chinese local governments. Moodyâ€™s on Tuesday revised its outlook for Chinese bank debts to negative, due to lack of a clear plan to reduce public debt.
