Borsa Italiana plans to tax high-frequency trading


Financial Times Deutschland understands that Borsa Italiana is planning to introduce a new charge applicable to high-frequency dealers who place a large number of orders and cancel them before execution. The stock market company decision is in line with a recommendation by the Italian regulator, Consob, which is seeking to forestall large price fluctuations. Borsa Italiana declined to comment.
