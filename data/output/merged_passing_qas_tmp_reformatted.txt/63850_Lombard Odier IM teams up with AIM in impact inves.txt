Lombard Odier IM teams up with AIM in impact investing


The asset management firm Lombard Odier Investment Managers (Lombard Odier IM), an affiliate of the Swiss Lombard Odier group ,on 19 January announced that it has signed a partnership with Affirmative Investment Management (AIM), a bond manager specialising in impact investing. The objective for the alliance is to allow Lombard Odier IM to “complement its existing activities in impact investing, and to launch a new fund which will work in particular to measurably combat global warming,” the asset management firm says in a statement.Lombard Odier IM and AIM have long been present in the sustainable investment and impact investing sectors. More than 20 years ago, Lombard Odier IM constructed an expert unit in socially responsible investment, and the firm “was one of the first institutions to include social and environmental criteria in its financial research, and to offer clients investment solutions which fully take its values into account,” the asset management firm says.For its part, AIM, founded in 2014, represents “the first bond management firm” dedicated to strategies which seek a positive social or climate impact, “while seeking to deliver a risk/return profile comparable to the bond market,” Lombard Odier IM says. AIM is led by Stephen Fitzgerald, former chief investment officer for global bonds at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, and a former member of the investment committee for the Australian Future Fund.
