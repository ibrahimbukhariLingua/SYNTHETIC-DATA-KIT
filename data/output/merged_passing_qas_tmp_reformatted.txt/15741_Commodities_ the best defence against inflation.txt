Commodities: the best defence against inflation


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Asian Investor reports that Peter Kerger, head of DG Advisors for Asia-Pacific in Singapore, claims that inflation-linked products, which are theoretically the ultimate defence against inflation, are not the best solution to gain from inflationary trends. From this point of view, itâ€™s a better idea to look to real assets such as commodities.The price of commodities rises in crises, he explains, while inflation-linked bonds are only attractive if prices rise further.Peter Kerger adds that Deutsche Asset Management, of which DB Advisors is the institutional unit, is seeking new solutions to cover against inflation, as part of its plans to become a niche player in Asia. It is planning to offer an unusual vehicle (other than an Asian equities product), which would be a complement to a fund of fund portfolio.In first quarter, Asian pension funds were widely demanding multi-asset class absolute return investments, in mandates totalling USD50m to USD500m, he says.
