Cadbury sued by a fund


Steward International Enhanced Value Index Fund, which invests according to biblical and Christian principles, filed a legal complaint in the US alleging that Cadbury’s board breached its fiduciary duties by rejecting Kraft’s GBP10.2bn takeover approach. The US mutual fund holds 6,720 Cadbury shares.
