The Swiss startup Seba Crypto, founded by two former UBS managers, has raised CHF100m (EUR88.1m) to create a bank offering crypto-currency services to businesses and investors, while also extending traditional banking services to companies in this new sector. The Swiss firm BlackRiver Asset Management, the Hong Kong-based Summer Capital, and Singapore, Malaysian, Chinese and Hong Kong investors are among the shareholders in Seba. The firm has also applied for a banking license from Finma, the Swiss federal market surveillance authority, to manage crypto-assets and crypto-currencies.
