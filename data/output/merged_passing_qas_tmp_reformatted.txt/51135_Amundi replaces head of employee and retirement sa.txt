The previous director of this activity, Peter Schereck, was yesterday appointed as director of commercial relationships with charities and social organisations on the institutional client team at Amundi, the asset management firm has announed. The employee savings and retirement unit under the leadership of Schereck “became the leader in employee savings management in France, with nearly EUR50bn,” Amundi states. Schereck is also a member of the executive board at Amundi. Meanwhile, Xavier Collot has been appointed as director of employee savings and retirement, replacing Schereck, to whom he had hitherto reported. Collot has worked on pan-European individual and collective retirement solutions. He will work to develop the employee savings and retirement unit, and in particular to assist businesses to evolve their collective retirement resources for all regions where they are present, Amundi says. Collot also joins the board of directors at Amundi.
