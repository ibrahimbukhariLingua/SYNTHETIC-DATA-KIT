KBC extends tobacco exclusion policy


Belgian financial group KBC is continuing its divestment from the tobacco industry, after signing the Tobacco-Free Finance Pledge, a financial engagement to avoid the tobacco industry, in late March. KBC thus extends its current policy of exclusion of the tobacco industry to credit, insurance and sustainable investments by conventional investment funds from KBC Asset Mangement, and its own investment portfolio. The exclusion applies to the manuffacture, wholesale and trading of tobacco products.
