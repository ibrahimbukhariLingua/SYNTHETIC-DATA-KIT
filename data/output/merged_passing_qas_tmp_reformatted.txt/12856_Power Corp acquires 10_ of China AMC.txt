Power Corp acquires 10% of China AMC


The Canadian financial services firm Power Corp will acquire a 10% stake in the asset management firm China AMC, in which CITIC Securities had held a 100% stake, in violation of Chinese legislation which forbids foreign shareholders from controlling more than 49% in a local asset management firm, for CNY1.78bn, or USD280m, which according to Z-Ben Advisors corresponds to 8% of assets under management by the business. As of the end of June, assets at China AMC totalled CNY221.5bn, representing a 9.5% share of the Chinese market.Once the deal is approved by the Chinese regulatory authority, the CSRC, China AMC will legally become a joint venture, as Shandong Rural Economy Development & Investment Company has already acquired a 10% stake in the management firm for USD250m (CNY1.6bn), and South Industry Asset Management Company has acquired an 11% stake in the business for USD275m, or CNY1.76bn. Z-Ben Advisors reports that two other 10% stakes in China AMC will be sold off in the near future, probably to Chinese government-controlled companies.
