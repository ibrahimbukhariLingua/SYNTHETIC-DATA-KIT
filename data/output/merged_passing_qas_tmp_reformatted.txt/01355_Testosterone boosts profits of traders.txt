Testosterone boosts profits of traders


«Male traders, like animals in the wild, take more risk when their testosterone levels rise», says John Coates, a research fellow in neuroscience and finance at Cambridge university in the Financial Times. Research by himself and his colleagues found that moderately elevated levels of this hormone increased the profits of high-frequency traders. But at higher levels it can cause overconfidence and risky behaviour. They could not say, however, was whether testosterone was having its beneficial effects by increasing the trader’s skill or merely by increasing his appetite for risk.
