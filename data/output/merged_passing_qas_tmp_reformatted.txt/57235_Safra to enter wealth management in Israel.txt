Safra to enter wealth management in Israel


According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, the Brazilian group Safra is actively preparing to return to Israel after a six-year absence. The plan is reportedly to offer investment advising to high net worth clients, residents with at least ILS7m (about EUR1.7m) in assets. The group is reported to have entered discussions with Israeli regulators, including the Bank of Israel.The group has a size advantage to put its strategy in action, due to the recent acquisition by J. Safra Sarasin of the international private banking activities of Hapoalim bank in Switzerland and Luxembourg. The offices of Hapoalim Switzerland in Israel would be the base for the new Safra offensive in the local private banking market.
