FSB creates a working group dedicated to information on risks


The Financial Stability Board (FSB) on 10 May announced the creation of a working group dedicated to improving information from financial institutions about exposure to risk and risk management practices, known as the Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF). The co-chairmen of the working group are Hugo Bänziger, chief risk officer and member of the board of directors at Deutsche Bank, Russell Picot, group general manager and group chief accounting officer at HSBC Holdings, and Christian Stracke, managing director, member of the investment committee and global head of credit research group at Pimco. The working group also includes 25 heads and experts representing financial establishments, analysts, ratings agencies and external auditors. These 25 members also include Gérard Gil, senior adviser at BNP Paribas. The top objectives of the working group are to develop principles to improve published information, including the compatibility of this information, and to identify major information about risk presented in 2011 annual reports. The working group’s recommendations will be published in October 2012.
