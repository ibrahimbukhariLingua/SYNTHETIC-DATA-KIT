JP Morgan to release an internal report on the Whale of London


The board of directors of the largest US bank, JPMorgan Chase, has decided to release an internal report on the Whale of London scandal, which cost the bank USD6.25bn last year, according to the New York Times. The decision was taken on 15 January, at the initiative of chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, despite the reservations of some heads, who were concerned that the 50-page document might be used as a basis for lawsuits against the bank, the newspaper adds, citing several sources familiar with the matter. The newspaper reports that the document, authored by former CFO Mike Cavanagh, was critical of Douglas Braunstein, the chief financial officer at the group at the time of the events, for failing to adequately oversee the activities of traders at the London bank.
