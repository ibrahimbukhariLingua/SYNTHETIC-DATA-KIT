Allfunds Bank, the leading European fund distribution platform, will distribute the funds of the Geneva based asset management company Decalia.The newly-signed agreement appoints Allfunds Bank as primary distributor of the Decalia Sicav in Italy and includes Decalia’s sub-funds in Allfunds Bank’s institutional platform used by wealth managers and funds of funds.The Decalia funds that will be distributed through Allfunds Bank’s sub-distributors network are two equity funds dedicated to consumer trends (Decalia Silver Generation – ageing theme – and Decalia Millennials – Millennials generation theme), two multi asset funds focused on quest for yield (Decalia Active Allocation and Decalia Conservative), and the Decalia European Conviction Equity fund, which aims to exploit the inefficiencies of European markets.“The agreement with Allfunds Bank will strongly accelerate Decalia’s development in Italy”, said Xavier Guillon, Partner and Head of Decalia Funds. “Decalia high value added funds with thematic and active investment strategies are now available on the most widespread distribution platform in Italy, which will generate new agreements with many distributors. In an increasingly standardized industry, the Decalia strategies are very distinctive and provide real answers in the current investment environment”.“Moreover, this agreement will allow Decalia to enter the private banking advisory market, which constitutes an important focus of our business strategy” added Jurgen Mahler, Head of Decalia Funds Italia. “It will also strengthen our presence in wealth management and in Italian fund of funds.”
