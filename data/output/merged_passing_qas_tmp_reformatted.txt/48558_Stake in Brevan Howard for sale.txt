Stake in Brevan Howard for sale


Swiss Re is looking to sell its minority stake in Brevan Howard Asset Management, which manages more than USD30 billion in several hedge funds, according to people familiar with the talks quoted by The Wall Street Journal. The move comes as the asset management company has to face recent poor performance and billions in investor outflows. Bids for the 15% stake were due last week, the people said. It wasnâ€™t clear who the possible bidders were, but the value of the stake is estimated between USD350 million and USD500 million.
