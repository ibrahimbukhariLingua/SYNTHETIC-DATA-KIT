Promotion at Allianz GI


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; }a:link { } Mathias MÃ¼ller, previously head of retail distribution in Germany, will be extending his area of responsibility. Since early February, he has also been head of retail clients for Europe, Fondsprofessionell indicates. The website states that this promotion is the direct result of the departure of James Dilworth last year for DeAWM, where he has been appointed head of active management and CEO. Dilworth, former CEO of Allianz Global Investors in Europe, has worked largely in retail distribution, Fondsprofessionell reports.
