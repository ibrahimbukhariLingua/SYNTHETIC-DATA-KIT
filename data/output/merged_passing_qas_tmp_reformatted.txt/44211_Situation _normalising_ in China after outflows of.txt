Situation “normalising” in China after outflows of USD5.3bn from funds


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Visibility for the euro zone has improved. As a result, over the past week, net flows have been posted to equity funds, totalling USD8bn, and to bond funds, where inflows totalled USD1bn.However, according to statistics from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Investment Grande bond funds have posted net outflows of USD2.3bn, the highest total since December 2013. At the other extreme, equity funds invested in Japan are continuing to seduce investors. With USD5bn, they have posted their highest net inflows since April 2014. Government bond funds, for their part, have seen USD2.6bn in net inflows, bringing them back to their levels of February this year.In emerging markets, ‘generalist’ equity funds posted net outflows of USD6.8bn. In a rather ‘surprising’ manner, Chinese equity funds have seen net redemptions of about USD5.3bn, after posting strong inflows last week of USD13bn, which gave rise to suspicions of government support led in by local brokers.Elsewhere, the Greek crisis, and subsequently risks in China have resulted in an asset turnover phenomenon, with fixed income products neglected in favour of equities. In numbers, since the end of May / beginning of June, bond and money market funds have lost USD24bn and USD26bn, respectively, while assets in equity funds increased by USD48bn.
