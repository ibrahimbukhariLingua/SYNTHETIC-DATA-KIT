Norwegian fund throws spotlight on water management


Responsible water management is one of the new priorities of Norges Bank Investment Management, the firm which manages the investments of the Norwegian oil fund, as part of its shareholder responsibility initiatives. “Water shortages worldwide represent a financial risk for the fund,” NBIM explains in a statement, adding that the issue affects 1,100 companies in the fund’s portfolio, with total market capitalisation of NOK265bn, or USD43bn (out of a total of NOK2.385trn). “At NBIM, we think investors should receive sufficient information to be able to evaluate how risks related to water shortages and the costs of regulation and water purification could affect profits for a given business, and to evaluate the likelihood that this will occur,” says Anne Kvam, head of governance. The fund has identified seven sectors which are highly exposed to risks due to potential water shortages: agrobusiness, agriculture, paper and pulp, pharmaceuticals, the mining sector, energy production and manufacturing, and water provision. In third quarter, NBIM will publish “NBIM Investor Expectations: Water Management,” a document which will state the fund’s expectations of companies in relation to water and resource management and the associated risks. The firm, which is highly active in the area of responsible investment, has also recently published a document on climate change. In second quarter, the Norwegian fund posted returns of 12.7%. The proportion of the fund invested in equities stood at 60.3% at the end of the quarter.
