Peter Cieszko (ex-Fidelity) joins American Century Investments


Peter Cieszko will be joining American Century Investments as its senior vice president for North America, a newly-created position, “later this summer.” The Kansas City-based management firm says that the new arrival will be responsible for institutional clients and North American intermediation. He will report to Michael Green, head of global client relationships. Cieszko left his position at Fidelity Investment Institutional Services Company (FIIS) in January, and has not been replaced since then, while Scott Couto, executive vice president and head of investment production management, marketing and investor consulting services, handles those responsibilities in the interim.
