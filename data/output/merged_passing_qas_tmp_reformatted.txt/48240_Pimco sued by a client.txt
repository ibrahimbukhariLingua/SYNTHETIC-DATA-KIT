Pimco sued by a client


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; }a:link { } A subscriber to the Pimco Total Return Fund, Robert Kenny, has filed suit against Pimco, claiming that the asset management firm is ripping off investors with excessive advising fees, to feed the bonuses of executives, Bloomberg reports. The suit, filed in Seattle, claims that fees totalling USD1.2bn in 2013 are unfair and excessive and have no reasonable relationship to the services rendered. Kenny claims that Pimco infringed its fiduciary duty with respect to investors, and should refund the undue payments to shareholders. Pimco paid more than USD1.5bn in bonuses to its top directors, at a time when performance suffered, Kenny points out. According to a spokesman, Pimco considers the lawsuit baseless.
