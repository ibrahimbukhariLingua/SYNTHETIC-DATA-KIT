BayernInvest absorbs its Luxembourg affiliate


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } The Munich-based institutional fund management firm Bayerninvest (EUR47bn in asets) has absorbed its wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary BayernInvest Luxembuorg (EUR1bn), a specialist in services to funds and the launch of white label funds. The latter entity provides custom solutions for complex Luxembourg-registered strategies in the form of UCITS-compliant specialised investment funds (SIFs).These solutions can then be integrated into the product range available in Germany in the form of open-ended funds, but this does not imply that BayernInvest is planning to enter the retail segment, says Oliver Schlick, CIO. The idea is to launch specialised open-ended funds aimed at qualified investors seeking attractive returns.As part of this integration, Guy Schmit, CEO of BayernInvest Luxembourg, is joining the executive committee at BayernInvest Munich. He will continue to be responsible for Luxembourg, but will also be responsible for marketing and distribution.
