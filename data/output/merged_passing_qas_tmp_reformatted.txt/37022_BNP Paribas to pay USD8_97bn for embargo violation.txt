The bank, which admits that it infringed certain laws and regulations of the United States concerning economic sanctions against certain countries, and the registration of related operations, will pay a total of USD8.97bn (EUR6.6bn). Due to the sums already provisioned, this will result in a total one-time write-down of EUR5.8bn on the accounts for second quarter 2014. The bank is also suspended for a period of one year, from 1 January 2015, from certain direct settlment operations in US dollars, largely dealing with the area of financing international commodity trading, in the oil and gas section, at certain locations. BNP Paribas will retain its licenses under the agreements, and does not anticipate any impact on its operational or commercial capacity to meet the needs of virtually all its clients. “In 2015, activities in the perimeter concerned will be settled in US dollars via a third-party bank, and not via the BNP Paribas branch in New York,” a statement says, adding that “all measures necessary will be taken to ensure a transition without difficulty and to avoid any significant impact on the clients concerned.” BNP Paribas points out that a part of the US settlement activity of the Group is already carried out via third-party banks.
