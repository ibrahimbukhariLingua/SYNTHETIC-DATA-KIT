IFAs recommend diversification of bond portfolios


According to a survey conducted between 17 November and 1 December, of 411 independent financial advisers (IFA) at the ABC of Bonds roadshow organised by Axa Investment Managers, Baring Asset Management and Cazenove Capital (see Newsmanagers of 1 October 2009), 66% of respondents estimate that market conditions will be promising for bonds in 2010, while 20% are planning to recommend that their clients increase their exposure to this asset class in the next twelve months, while 17% will recommend reducing exposure, and 54% feel that the current allocation is correct. One of the defining characteristics of this year will be increased diversification, with 86% of IFAs stating that they will recommend diversification in bonds. 65% will recommend strategic bond funds, while 57% will recommend absolute return bond funds, and 53% will recommend corporate bond funds. Half of all advisers estimate that their clients will allocate 11% to 25% of their portfolios to bonds, and 35% estimate that a 35% exposure is appropriate. The study also shows that 85% of clients expect their bond portfolios to turn in performance of 3% to 5%, while one in eight expects 6% or more.
