LuxFLAG launches a label for green bonds


LuxFLAG, the Luxembourg-based labelling agency, on 19 June announced the launch of a new label for green bonds, which will be awarded after “rigorous” evaluation to eligible bonds which finance green or sustainable products. The independent index thus extends its activities to an extended range of financial instruments, and plans to rely on its expertise in the area of certification of sustainable investment funds in the fields of microfinance, the environment, environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, and financing for climate change.“To strenghen credibility and to allow sustainable growth on the green bond market, investors need to ensure that earnings from green bonds are invested according to their strategy and the principle of green bonds,” LuxFLAG explains in a statement. “Issuers, for their part, need to communicate effectively about the characteristics of their bonds to the community of investors. Transparency, relevance and trust are the key requirements for investment in the green bond market.”To earn the label, LuxFLAG wil require green bond to establish a report on bond qualitative and quantitative performance indicators concerning the use of their earnings. They also need to provide an ex-ante external evaluation, and to commit to regular ex-post reports. Green bonds also must agree to transparency and to following internationally recognized standards, such as the “Green Bond Principles” and “Climate Bond Initiative.” The “Sustainable Development Objectives” from the United Nations must also be taken into account when using the proceeds, and an exclusion policy must be put in place.LuxFLAG will carry out an analysis of incoming requests on a ‘first come, first served’ basis. Decisions to grant the label will be taken on a quarterly basis.
