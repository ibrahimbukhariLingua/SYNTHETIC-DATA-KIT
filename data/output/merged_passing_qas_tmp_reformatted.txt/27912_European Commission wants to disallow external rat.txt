European Commission wants to disallow external ratings use by money market funds


After several delays, the European Commission has decided to unveil its “roadmap” for regulation of the shadow banking sector on Wednesday. The initiative at present includes only one piece of legislation, concerning money market funds whose rists are underestimated in the opinion of the Commission. They will in the future be required to have a “liquidity cushion” equal to 3% of the net value of assets, according to a draft which is still subject to modifications. Managers will also be required to “cease to base themselves on external credit ratings,” which would provide a false promise of stability in the immediate sale value of securities, and instead develop an internal ratings system, the newspaper says. The European Commission is also focusing on the various forms of “credit financing transactions,” ranging from repo to securities lending, which have been developed since 2008 as collateral requirements have become more systematic.
