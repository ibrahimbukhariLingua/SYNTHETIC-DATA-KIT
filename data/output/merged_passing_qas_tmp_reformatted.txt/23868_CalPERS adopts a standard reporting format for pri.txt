CalPERS adopts a standard reporting format for private equity


The Californian pension fund CalPERS on 27 February announced that it has created a standard reporting structure for its private equity activities, inspired by the Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA), for all general partners of the fund. The new format will allow private equity activities undertaken within CalPERS Alternative Investment Management (AIM) to better account for risk management, transparency and good governance, CalPERS says in a statement. All general partners and fund of fund managers will be required to apply the new rules by 1 March 2012. As of 30 June 2011, CalPERSâ€™ engagements in private equity totalled USD49.5bn.
