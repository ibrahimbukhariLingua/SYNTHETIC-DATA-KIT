Deutsche Bank may have to sell off its asset management activities in parts


Since JP Morgan, and now State Street, have dropped out of the running, it is increasingly likely that Deutsche Bank will have to sell off its activities in the areas of asset management (EUR400bn) separately, the Financial Times reports. The newspaper expects to see Ameriprise Financial pull out of the running soon, as it finds the price too high. But a sale in parts would be a more complex undertaking, and would increase the risk of seeing key personnel and top investment teams leave the firm.
