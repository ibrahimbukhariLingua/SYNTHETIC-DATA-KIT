Fund association opposes fund fee legislation in Sweden


The Swedish investment fund association is opposed to proposals by the chairman of the taxation committee of Parliament which would require asset management firms to charge fund fees separately, rather than taking them out of assets, in order to promote transparency. In a statement released on Tuesday, Thomas Eriksson and Pia Nilsson, charman and CEO, respectively, of the Fondbolagens Förening association, explain why they find the proposals of Henrik von Sydow inappropriate. “In our opinion, that would have a negative impact on the capacity of investors to compare funds, without taking into account the bureaucracy which it would imply. Management fees are charged every day at 1/365. How often would invoices need to be sent?” they ask. They also point out that the Swedish market includes 5,000 funds, but there are only 800 Swedish-registered funds which would be affected by the proposed legislation. “Can we have different rules for Swedish and foreign funds?” they ask.
