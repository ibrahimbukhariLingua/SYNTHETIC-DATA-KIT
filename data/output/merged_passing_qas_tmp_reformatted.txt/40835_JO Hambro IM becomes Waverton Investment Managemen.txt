JO Hambro IM becomes Waverton Investment Management


Times are changing at JO Hambro Investment Management (IM). The British asset management boutique on 13 January announced that it will be changing names to become Waverton Investment Management. The change follows the sale of JO Hambro IM by Credit Suisse in 2013 to its management and the Bermuda-listed financial group Somers Limited. The asset management firm provides discretionary portfolio management to private clients, charities and other institutions. It also offers a range of offshore funds through its Dublin-based Waverton funds.
