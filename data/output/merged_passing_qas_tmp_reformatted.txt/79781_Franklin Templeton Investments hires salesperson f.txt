Franklin Templeton Investments hires salesperson for Italy


Franklin Templeton Investments has recruited Claudio Morelli in Italy as its senior sales executive, an addition to its presence in the country. Morelli joins from Amundi Asset Management, where he had worked as part of the sales management. Before that, he spent several years at Pioneer Investments, where he was an analyst and then manager. Morelli will report to Aurea Pagnani, senior sales manager and head of the Banking channel, and will be based in Milan. “The expansion of the Italian office, now including 29 professionals, is a sign of a desire to get even closer to the distribution networks, and to respond even better to the needs of Italian clients,” says Michele Quinto, co-branch manager and retail sales director at Franklin Templeton Investments for Italy.
