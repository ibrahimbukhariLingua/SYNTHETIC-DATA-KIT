BNP Paribas IP promotes a new low volatility strategy


BNP Paribas Investment Partners has launched a global promotion campaign to promote a new strategy which is presented as a second-generation investment approach to low volaitlity equities.In light of growing interest on the part of institutional investors in charge of equity strategies based on risk criteria, BNP Paribas Investment Partners has engaged in a reflection on the various existing approaches in an article which appeared in the Journal of Portfolio Management («Demystifying Equity-Based Strategies : A Simple Alpha plus Beta Description», by Pierre Moulin, Raul Leote de Carvalho and Xiao Lu, all of BNP Paribas Investment Partners).One of the main conclusions of the research is that strategies based on risk criteria can play a central role in portfolios. They also explain an anomaly of volatility, that shares with less risk generate better returns, which contradicts the model of financial asset valuations by which returns on an equity are proportional to the beta on the equity. The fund BNP LI Equity World Low Volatility, which has been in existence for one year, and which has total assets of about EUR35m, and mandates in addition, is a proprietary systematic strategy which aims to benefit from this anomaly in volatility, and which can be used to correct the problem of high tracking error observed for traditional minimum variance strategies.At a recent presentation, Pierre Moulin, head of financial engineering at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, and Denis Panel, head of investments at Theam, have defined principles, with supporting statistics, which support the major advantages of this strategy, which primarily invests in shares with low risk levels in all sectors, with an investment horizon of two to three years and monthly rebalancing.Structurally, the new fund provides a clear way to significantly reduce volatility in a controlled manner. Then, it brings spectacular improvement to the Sharpe ratio compared with the MSCI World index (0.45 compared with 0.12 for the benchmark index between January 1005-December 2011). It also earns a high information ratio (0.72), with tracking error risk of 5.5%. Lastly, the strategy outperforms in virtually all market situations, particularly phases of falling markets, though it tends to ouperform the benchmark index only in phases of very strong rebound.Since its launch in April 2011, the fund has earned returns of 11.87%, compared with 5.28% for the benchmark index, an outperformance of 6.59%.
