Good start to the year for Muzinich in France


The high yield management specialist Muzinixh has posted a net inflow in the first four months of the year of over EUR200m in France. These inflows went to all portions of the asset class. Assets under management in Paris as of the end of April totalled over EUR1bn, of which 50% were from France itself, and 50% from the other French-speaking countries of Europe (Switzerland, Belgium, and Luxembourg). Total net inflows to UCITS III funds have totalled USD1.7bn since the beginning of the year, for total assets of USD5.2bn. Assets in the Short Duration High Yield sub-fund, launched in October 2010, totalled about USD1.13bn, putting total assets under management at Muzinich as of the end of April at USD13.5bn. At a press conference, the director of the Paris office, Eric Pictet, pointed to investorsâ€™ growing interest in the asset class, particularly on the part of pension funds and insurers in France. Since the beginning of the year, financing activities (refinancing of existing bonds or loans) represented about two thirds of all issues (USD130bn). Muzinich estimates that in the next twelve months, traditional horizon funds will earn returns of 4% to 9%, barring any external shocks, and that horizon funds with a duration of less than two years will earn 2% to 6%.
