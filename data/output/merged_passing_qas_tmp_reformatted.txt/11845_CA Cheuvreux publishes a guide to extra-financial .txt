CA Cheuvreux publishes a guide to extra-financial communication from listed companies


Cr√©dit Agricole Cheuvreux on 30 September announced the publication of the second in a series of guides, which provided a synthesis of the increasingly pressing expectations of investors for transparency on the part of companies about environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.The guide aims primarily to help listed companies to strengthen their transparency and the pertinence of their extra-financial communication, in order to meet the demands of a new generation of investors who would like a way to integrate ESG criteria into their investment selection process, either with a social responsibility or an investment discipline outlook.The publication of the guide comes at a time when initiatives are converging, including the Grenelle law in France, and proposals by the European Commission and the G20, to standardise reporting about environmental, social and governance topics.The guide foregrounds the need for listed businesses to continue to progress in the precision and pertinence of their extra-financial communication, adapting this communication to the dynamics and changes in the behaviour of asset managers, to engage in proactive dialogue with investors in order to communicate about performance in sustainable development terms, and to improve comprehension by the market of the reality and fundamental nature of issues beyond purely financial items.
