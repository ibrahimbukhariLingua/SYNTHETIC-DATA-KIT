Spanish government to eliminate obstacles to fund supermarkets


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Spanish minister of the economy has at least partly heeded advice from management firms and their professional association (Inverco): he is going to remove one of the most significant obstacles to third-party fund distribution, Cinco Días reports. With the transposition of the UCITS IV directive, which modifies Spanish law on collective investment organisms, a draft of which has been opened for a market consultation (until 28 February), fund distributors will no longer be required to provide managers with the details of subscribers to the products. This arrangement will result in the creation of global accounts, known as “omnibus” accounts. However, the legislator for the moment has not opted to take up another suggestion, which would have made it easier to sell Spanish funds abroad via omnibus accounts: this provision is not included in the draft legislation.
