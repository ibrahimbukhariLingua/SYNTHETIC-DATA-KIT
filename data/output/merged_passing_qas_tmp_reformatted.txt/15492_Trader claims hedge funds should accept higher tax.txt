Trader claims hedge funds should accept higher taxes in London


Hedge funds should accept higher taxes in London and stop threatening to move elsewhere, according to Michael Farmer, a Conservative party donor who runs the near-USD1bn Red Kite metals hedge funds. “If one is a citizen and your country’s having a tough time, you pay your taxes and that’s it – although rather reluctantly if they are not spending it wisely,” he told the Financial Times.
