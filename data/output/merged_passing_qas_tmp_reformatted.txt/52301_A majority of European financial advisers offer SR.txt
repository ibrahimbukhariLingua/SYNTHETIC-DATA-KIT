A majority of European financial advisers offer SRI funds


Slightly over half of financial advisers across Europe (52%) offer socially responsible investment (SRI) funds, a new research commissioned by Candriam Investors Group covering 153 professionals in eight markets has shown. 61% say they perceive “added value in the application of ESG principles in stock-picking.”The study points to a lack of appetite for SRI or ESG funds on the part of final (retail) investors. When asked about the main reason they do not offer such funds, 58% of advisers cite insufficient demand. On the subject of performance, however, only 8% cite this. And financial advisers cannot now be relied on to encourage investors to turn to SRI, since only 18% offer products in this strategy even when clients are not expressly asking for it, illustrating a lack of proactivity on their part in this area. However, over 70% of financial advisers claim that allocations to funds of this type will increase in the next five or ten years.It is to be noted that this European picture masks large disparities by country. The retail markets which appear to be the most advanced in terms of SRI are the Northern European ones. The Netherlands and the United Kingdom have the highest percentage of advisers offering SRI funds, with 62% each. However, knowledge of ESG themes is best in the Netherlands and Scandinavia.
