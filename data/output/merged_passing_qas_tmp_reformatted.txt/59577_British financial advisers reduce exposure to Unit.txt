British financial advisers reduce exposure to United Kingdom


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } British financial advisers are increasingly concerned about the fallout from Brexit, and in second quarter 2017, an increase has been observed in portfolios reducing their exposure to the British market, according to the most recent barometer of British portfolios by Natixis Global Asset Management (NGAM). The barometer, which tracks the activities of 117 model portfolios distributed in the conservative, moderate and aggressive categories, finds that the conservative baskets are tending to evolve toward multi-asset absolute return strategies, as advisers estimate that bonds, particularly with a “domestic” bias, will probably generate the most attractive returns, with a higher level of risk than in previous years. The data from the Portfolio Research and Consulting Group (PRCG) also finds an increase in the “moderate” models for flows to bonds, particularly in the international and European segments, and an increase in the “agressive” models in exposure to international equities within that asset class.
