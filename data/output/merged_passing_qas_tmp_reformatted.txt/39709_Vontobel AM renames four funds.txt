Vontobel AM renames four funds


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Vontobel Asset Management is putting its product range in order. The Swiss asset management firm has decided to rename four of its Luxemborg-domiciled funds in order to remove an accent deceptively placed on the notion of “value” investment, Citywire Global reports. As part of the changes, the group has removed the term “value” from a number of its “quality growth” equity funds. The European Value Equity fund (EUR336m in assets) becomes the European Equity Fund. The US Value Equity, Global Vlaue Equity and Global Value Equity (ex-US) vehicles have been similarly renamed. However, Vontobel states that no changes are planned for the Emerging Markets Equity and Far East Equity funds. In a note to investors, the Swiss group states that “the term ‘value’ in the official names of funds concerned incorrectly implies and does not precisely reflect the investment style with which the funds are managed.”
