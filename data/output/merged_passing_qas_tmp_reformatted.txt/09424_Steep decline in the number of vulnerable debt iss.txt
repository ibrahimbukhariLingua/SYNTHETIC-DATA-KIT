Steep decline in the number of vulnerable debt issuers worldwide


According to a recently-published study by Standard & Poor’s, the number of vulnerable debt issuers worldwide has fallen significantly from its peak in April 2009 (300 businesses). As of 8 February, Standard & Poor’s found a total of 213 firms (including 141 in the United States) in this category, which includes issuers rated B- or lower, with a negative orientation to ratings, either because the firm is affected by a negative outlook, or because it is subject to a negative ratings watch. One year previously, the number of vulnerable businesses totaled 265. The cumulative debt of these 213 firms as of the beginning of February totaled USD197.53bn. The ratings agency also points out that from the beginning of the year to 8 February, it has counted 13 defaults by issuers, representing USD5.9bn in debt. For the year 2009 as a whole, it counted 264 issuers in default, with total debt of USD627.7bn. Most of the defaults observed since the beginning of this year have been in the United States (12). Meanwhile, after 19 consecutive months of increase, the default rate on speculative category corporate debt has fallen for the second consecutive month, to 9.22% worldwide in January, compared with 9.23% in December 2009.
