UBS to name 5,000 US clients


“UBS may reveal the identity of 4,500 to 5,000 of its US clients with secret accounts in Switzerland, under an agreement reached last week between the US government and the bank,” L’Agefi reports, citing the Swiss weekend press. The weekly newsmagazine NZZ am Sonntag states that the agreement in question, which is to be signed this week, will be modelled on a previous agreement reached in 1996.
