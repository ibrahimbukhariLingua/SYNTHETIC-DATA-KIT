State Street investor confidence index up in March


The investor confidence index calculated by State Street Global Markets posted an increase in March of 5.4 points, to 108 points, compared with a corrected level of 102.6 for February. Institutional investors in Asia were the foremost cause of this movement, as the regional index gained 4.1 points to 100.8, compared with a corrected level of 96.7 points the previous month. Changes were more moderate elsewhere: investor confidence in North America increased slightly, from 110.1 (corrected level) to 110.4, while in Europe, confidence remains slightly lower, with the regional index down slightly, from 99.8 (corrected level) to 97.3 points in March. In addition to this significant increase in the confidence of institutional investors, “it is interesting to note that we are beginning to observe some divergence between the confidence of investors and consumers in the United States, as consumers are becoming less confident and investors are gaining confidence,” says Paul O’Connell, one of the two creators of the index. “It remains to be seen whether consumer sentiment will change this month, but in the meanwhile, institutional investors have been persistent in their acquisitions on many markets and in many sectors, with the exception of the economies on the periphery of Europe, and some specific sectors such as health.”
