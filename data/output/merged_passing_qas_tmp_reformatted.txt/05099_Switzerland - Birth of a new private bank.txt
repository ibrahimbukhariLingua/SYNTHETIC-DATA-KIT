Switzerland - Birth of a new private bank


L’Agefi Suisse reports that a new private bank has been created. The newborn entity, called Von Roll Bank, was founded by the holding company that owns the Von Roll industrial group. It will not be confined to managing the fortune of the Von Finck family, says its CEO, Cyrill Escher. ?No house products, and no agreement with distributors: the spinoff of the Von Roll industrial group wants to distance itself from the products and practices which have discredited the world of finance,? the Swiss news source comments.
