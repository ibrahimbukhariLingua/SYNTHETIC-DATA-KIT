Malaysian pension fund seeks to double international exposure


The Malaysian public pension fund KWAP is seeking to double the exposure of its portfolio to international investments, which are set to increase from 10% currently to 20% in the next few years, Asian Investor reports. With this in mind, the pension fund, whose assets under management total about USD40bn, has scaled up its expertise in some areas, such as portfolio hedging, while outsourcing some mandates to external asset management firms. The pension fund states that it plans to develop its capacities on emerging markets, outsourcing some mandates and creating an internal team dedicated to emerging markets.
