AMF sanctions Wendel and Jean-Bernard Lafonta in Saint-Gobain affair


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The sanctions committee of the AMF on 17 January announced that, according to a decision on 13 January 2010, it has fined the Wendel company and Jean-Bernard Lafonta, chairman of the board at the management firm, an initial sum of EUR1.5m each, for failure to disclose market information about preparations for Wendel to increase its stake in Saint-Gobain. The AMF procedure dealt with the way in which Wendel indirectly acquired a stake in Saint-Gobain when the firm announced that it had passed the 5% threshold in the construction material group’s capital, in late September 2007. The challenge was to determine whether Wendel would have been required to inform the market of the existence of its position in derivative products which, indirectly, increased its position in the capital of Saint-Gobain. The sanctions committee found in the affirmative to this question, and concluded that the derivative products and financial agreements made in parallel with banks “were set up with the essential objective of preparing for an increase of Wendel’s stake in the capital of Saint-Gobain,” the AMF says in a statement. The sanctions commission emphasizes that “the mechanism put in place was set up in conditions which constitute an unfaithful reading of rules which are intended to guarantee financial information which is indispensable to the proper functioning of the market, and which therefore constitutes legal fraud.” It has also found against Wendel and Lafonta on charges of violating article 223-2 of the AMF general rules (“All issuers must, whenever possible, make the public aware of any privileged information as defined by article 621-1, which directly concern it.”) With statements that “by 21 June 2007, preparations by Wendel for the financial operation to acquire a stake in Saint-Gobain were already sufficiently advanced,” and that “on 3 September 2007 the board of Wendel decided to begin acquiring shares in Saint-Gobain,” the Commission claims that by 3 September at the latest, Wendel should have announced the information to the market, as it was likely to have an influence on the share price. Finally, the Commission states that the reason for the pecuniary sanction, which is set at the limit defined by the regulations in force on the date the deeds were committed, is due to “the scale of the violation of financial information rules and principles.”
