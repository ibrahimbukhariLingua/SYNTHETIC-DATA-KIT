Vanguard creates a structure dedicated to innovation


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Vanguard has announced the creation of a new entity, dedicated entirely to the development of services that may meet the constantly changing needs of retail and institutional clients, as well as financial advisers, to be known as the Vanguard Innovation Center, and to open during second quarter 2017, at a base in Philadelphia. More than 90% of trades at Vanguard for its 20 million clients are processed digitally, which allows the group to increase its productivity, lower costs and improve relationships with clients. A recent illustration of this development is the new service structure, Vanguard Personal Advisor Services, one of the first hybrid offerings, which combines bespoke financial planning with automated advising with the assistance of a financial adviser. The entity, introduced in May 2015, now has USD47bn in assets under management.
