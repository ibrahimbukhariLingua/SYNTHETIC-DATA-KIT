Very marked rebound in investor optimism


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Trump effect: once again highly optimistic, investors are seeing the world in rose. In early December, a net 57% of investors predicted improvement in economic outlooks, a percentage not seen in 19 months, compared with only 35% in November, while outlooks for inflation are at their highest levels in 12 years, according to the most recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey, covering a sample of 173 clients between 2 and 8 December, representing cumulative assets under management of USD473bn. As a result, cash allocations are continuing to decline, to 4.8% in December, from 5% in November, and 5.8% in October. More than one investor in two (54%, compared with 44% one month earlier) estimates that turnover in favour of cyclicals and sectors related to inflation will continue in 2017, supported by a strong US dollar and rising interest rates. US equities are increasing as a percentage of allocations, with 15% of investors overweight in the asset class, compared with only 4% one month earlier. Investors are finding large appetites for Japanese equities. 21% of investors are overweight in this assets class, though only a net 5% had been overweight in the previous month. The two largest risks cited by investors are a collapse of the European Union and a bond crash, which would result in highly reduced exposures to the European Union and to bonds. Investors are underweight on European equities for the first time in five months.
