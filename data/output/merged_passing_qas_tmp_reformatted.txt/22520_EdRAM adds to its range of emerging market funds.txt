EdRAM adds to its range of emerging market funds


Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (EdRAM) is launching new funds in its emerging markets range: Edmond de Rothschild Eastern Europe and Edmond de Rothschild Latin America. The first of these is a fund which privileges themes that may provide sustainable growth (consumer spending, infrastructure investment and commodity procurement). It invests in equities from emerging Europe, which offer growth in profits, good visibility and attractive valuations. The mutual fund is managed by Gegham Ananyan, assisted by Thomas Gerhardt, director of emerging market equity and commodity management. The second is a fund which seeks to capture growth in Latin America, by adopting positions on major equity markets – Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Mexico and Chile – through major investment themes: consumer spending, infrastructure and energy. Managers select businesses which offer the best growth rates and/or which are likely to become future leaders in their sectors. The mutual fund is managed by Patricia Urbano, assisted by Martin Fechtner, a fund manager specialised in emerging market equities, with a team of 10 manager/analysts.
