Warren Buffett and 3G Capital acquire the ketchup company Heinz


The holding company of the billionaire Warren Buffett Berkshire Hathaway, in partnership with the investment fund 3G Capital, will acquire the agribusiness giant Heinz, on the basis of a valuation of USD28bn for the business, according to a statement released on 14 February. The transaction, which will be completed in cash, will be finalised in third quarter. It is described as one of the largest deals ever in the agribusiness sector. By the terms of the agreement, which is described in the statement as final, and which has unanimously been approved by the board of directors at Heinz, the two buyers will pay USD72.50 per share for the target. This represents a 20% premium over the share price of Heinz at the close of trading the previous day (USD60.48). The new buyers also plan to extend the maturity on Heinz’s debts, they announce in the statement. Heinz has solid and sustained growth, at which Buffett expresses pleasure in the statement, attributing this to the work of the group’s management. The Heinz headquarters will remain in Pittsburgh after the transaction is completed. The operation is still pending the approval of antitrust authorities.
