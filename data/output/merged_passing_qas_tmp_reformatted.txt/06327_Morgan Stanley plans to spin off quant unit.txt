Morgan Stanley plans to spin off quant unit


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The New York Times reports that Morgan Stanley and Peter Muller, the head of its Process Driven Trading unit, specialised in quantitative management, are in advanced talks over plans to spin off the unit. The newspaper reports that Morgan Stanley may separate from the entity, and retain a minority stake, while Muller would retain access to Morgan Stanleyâ€™s infrastructure. The Process Driven Trading unit has earned about USD4bn in profits in the ten years to 2006, but since the financial crisis and the passage of the Dodd-Franck law, which limits proprietary trading activities by Wall Street firms, Morgan Stanley, like other Wall Street firms, has decided to adapt to the new environment.
