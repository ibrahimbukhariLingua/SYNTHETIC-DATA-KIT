Columbia Threadneedle launches responsible investment ratings system


Columbia Threadneedle Investments is adding to its fundamental research effort by launching an innovative responsible investment (RI) ratings system that combines an assessment of a company’s financial stewardship with a view on how well it manages its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks. «By combining both aspects into a single, forward-looking rating from 1 to 5, the tool reflects Columbia Threadneedle’s conviction that prudent management of financial and ESG factors are important to a company’s ability to create long-term, sustainable value», says a statement. The RI ratings tool was developed in conjunction with Columbia Threadneedle’s global Responsible Investment team of 12, headed by Iain Richards, Global Head of Responsible Investment. This team includes experts in RI analytics, ESG research and integration, stewardship and engagement, proxy voting, sustainable outcomes and thematic RI research. Equity portfolio management teams began using this additive research tool in 2018; it is being rolled out to fixed income investment teams in 2019. “Combining evidence-based ratings and analysis with the power of data science, puts real-time, actionable intelligence into the hands of portfolio managers and analysts, providing them with the ability to effectively integrate that intelligence into the research and assessment of investment opportunities and exposures. This is about putting the “investment” into Responsible Investment,” underlines Iain Richards.
