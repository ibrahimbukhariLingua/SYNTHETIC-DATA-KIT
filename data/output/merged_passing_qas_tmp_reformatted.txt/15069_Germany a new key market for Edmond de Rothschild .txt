Germany a new key market for Edmond de Rothschild AM


Two developments are signs of the importance of the German market in the international development strategy of Edmond de Rothschild AM, which has announced a number of initiatives in recent years, opening new locations in Hong Kong, Chile, Spain, and most recently, Belgium.“In the next five years, Germany will become one of our largest markets in Europe, after France. We would like to set up a complete activity in the country,” the chairman of the board at EdRAM, Philippe Couvrecelle, announced on 7 April in Frankfurt. More precisely, the firm is hoping to achieve a level of assets under management of EUR3bn to EUR5bn in the meanwhile.Efforts are not only concentrated on the sales team, which has recently begun work following registration in Germany of 26 house funds, but also extend to the development of areas of excellence in Frankfurt in emerging markets for EdRAM.Thomas Gerhardt, previously head of the emerging markets equities team at DWS, has joined EdRAM with the mission of strengthening the emerging markets and commodities team with the addition of at least three managers in Frankfurt in the next few months, as addition to the four managers based in Paris and six managers specialised in Asian equities based in Hong Kong.“Our objective in the German-speaking countries is to develop our activities in parallel serving institutional investors and sales intermediated by platforms and wealth managers,” the head of the Frankfurt office, Rupert Hengster, says, adding that the firm is planning to enter the Austrian market by the end of summer.Hengster estimates that the entry into the German market comes at a favourable time.Did EdRAM wait too long to enter the German market, as many competitors have already invested in that market? “Our arrival on the German market is not related to what competitors do,” responds Couvrecelle. One does not enter such a large and competitive market without all the advantages one can assemble on one’s side.Among these, teams have been strengthened, and highly significant new investment expertise has been added, including EUR10m in investment in IT system integration. “With a complete and competitive range of funds, we are now well-positioned to accelerate our foreign development, especially in Germany, where we have high hopes,” says Hengster. When asked if double-digit staff numbers are expected by the end of this year, Hengster responds with a smile that clients will decide the pace of growth.
