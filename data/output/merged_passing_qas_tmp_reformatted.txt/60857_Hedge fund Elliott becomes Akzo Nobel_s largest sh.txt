Hedge fund Elliott becomes Akzo Nobel’s largest shareholder


Hedge fund Elliott Advisors has become Dutch paint maker Akzo Nobel’s largest shareholder by increasing its stake to at least 5 percent, according to a filing published by Dutch regulators on Friday, says Reuters. Elliott’s move follows a decision last week by U.S. firm PPG Industries to drop its attempts to buy Akzo for at least six months. Under Dutch market rules, investors must report their holdings when they pass certain thresholds. Elliott could in theory own anywhere between 5 percent and 10 percent of Akzo’s outstanding share capital.Elliott led a group of shareholders dissatisfied with Akzo’s reluctance to enter talks with PPG over a 26.3 billion euro ($29.44 billion) buyout proposal, which represented a 50 percent premium to Akzo’s share price in March before the approach.
