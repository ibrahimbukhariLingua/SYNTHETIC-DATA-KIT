Investors adopt wait-and-see attitude


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } There are too many uncertainties. Investors, preoccupied by the prospect of an interest rate hike, Greek turbulence and the formation of a bubble in Chinese equities, have adopted a wait-and-see attitude, according to the latest BofA Merrill Lynch survey, carried out between 5 and 11 June, and covering a sample of 207 participants, representing cumulative assets under management of USD562bn.International investors have pulled out of equities to invest in cash, while waiting for an increase in US interest rates which is anticipated by 80% of respondents, a level not seen since May 2011. Only 38% of investors are overweight in equities, compared with 47% one month previously, while cash allocations now represent 4.9% of portfolios, compared with 4.5% in May. In Greece, most investors do not foresee a favourable outcome, as 15% are planning a pure and simple exit of Greece from the euro zone, known as a “Grexit,” and 42% are predicting a default, but without an exit from the euro zone. Due to concerns over Greece, aversion to risk has increased sharply among European investors, and their cash levels are at their highest for six years. Seven investors out of 10 estimate that the Chinese stock market is overheating, and the percentage of investors who are underweight in emerging markets has surged to a net 21% from 6% in May.
