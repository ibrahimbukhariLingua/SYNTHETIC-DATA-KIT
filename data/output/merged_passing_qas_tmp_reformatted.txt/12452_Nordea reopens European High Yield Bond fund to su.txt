Nordea reopens European High Yield Bond fund to subscribers


After nearly a year in soft closing, subscriptions to the European High Yield Bond Fund, a sub-fund of the Luxembourg Sicav Nordea 1, were reopened on 5 September. Officially, the fund (LU0141799097), with EUR1.15bn in assets, is now no longer constrained by its size, due to the enlargement of the European high yield bond market due to a record number of issues. In practice, it also appears that assets have somewhat declined, which leaves more room for the fund to accept new subscriptions.Nordea observes that concerns about the solvency of some Western countries, and anticipation of a slowdown in global growth have provoked a sharp increase in spreads on the high yield bond market. The external management team, led by Henrik Ã˜stergaard, points out that in August, the Option Adjusted Spread (OAS) widened by 237 basis points, to 852 points. This spread level theoretically makes it possible to offset a default rate of over 10%, though the default rate is currently only 2%.
