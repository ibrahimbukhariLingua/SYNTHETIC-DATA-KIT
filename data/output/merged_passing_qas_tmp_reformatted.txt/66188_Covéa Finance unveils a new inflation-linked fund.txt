Covéa Finance unveils a new inflation-linked fund


Covéa Finance the portfolio management firm from the insurance group Covéa, yesterday announced the launch of Covéa Rendement Reél, a new inflation-linked fund. “Having observed the turning point in a secular downward movement in interest rates and inflation, Covéa Finance is seeking to seize this opportunity to offer a new investment resource to protect savings against rising prices,” the firm explains in a statement. The new fund, which will track and analyse inflation-related factors, will have a “real assets” dimension. In fact, the fund may invest in commodities in the form of funds or derivative products, as well as in convertible equities or bonds for up to 5% each, while limiting its choice of stocks to issuers within a sector in line with the consumer price index. “The management teams at Covéa Finance will for the new fund work to benefit from evolving interest rates worldwide, selecting government and private securities which are linked to inflation and which offer the best potential for performance in terms of real inflation rates,” the asset management firm adds. Currency risks are limited to 20% of net asset value. The sensitivity of the fund may range from 0 to 15, in order to generate absolute value, regardless of the direction of nominal interest rates, Covéa Finance says. “The creation of the fund makes it possible for institutional investors (insurers, pension fund...) and fund distributors (discretionary managers, advising managers) to use an investment support which matches one of their passive needs: preservation of savings in the face of inflation,” Covéa Finance concludes. p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; }
