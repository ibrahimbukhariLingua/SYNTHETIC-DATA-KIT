Carmignac Gestion continues to push for pan-European retirement product


Carmignac Gestion has reaffirmed its support for research into long-term investment and retirement saings with the presentation of a report by a working group at the Center for European Policy Studies (CEPS), for which it was the exclusive sponsor, “Saving for Retirement and Investing for Growth.” This publication comes at the end of a European legislative term which suggested at times that the problem would be handled, btu which has ended without any advancement on the subject. A vehicle was proposed (ELTIF) for institutional but not household investors. The reasons for delaying the introduction of a European product which would facilitate savings and long-term household investment are multiple. Household savings, which are abundant, have no vehicle to be invested in the long term, the chairman of CEPS, Karel Lanoo said in Paris on 6 November at a press conference. Households hold the largest proportion of European savings (43%), of which more than half is invested in savings, in an unfavourable context in which adversion to risk is increasing, probably partly due to the financial crisis, and in which national solutions are costly and perform poorly.
