FTSE Russell launches an index focused on exposure to coal


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The international index provider FTSE Russell on 28 July announced the launch of the FTSE All-World ex Coal Index, a suite of market indices which will exclude businesses with exposure to coal mines and mining companies generally. The new series of indices will assist market participants to manage the exposure of their fossil fuel-related portfolios. The design of the indices is based on the exclusion of companies whose main activity is related to the exploitation of coal or mining operations in the larger sense, as identified by the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB), FTSE Russell says in a statement.
