New wave of lawsuits against banks over Morgan Stanley P2 Value


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Hamburg-based law firm Hahn Rechtsanw√§lte Partnerschaft (hrp) on 24 November announced that it has filed lawsuits against banks in several German district courts (Landgerichte) in the name of four clients, for having provided erroneous advice concerning the open-ended real estate fund P2 Value (EUR1.4bn), from the Munich-based management firm Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investment GmbH. A first lawsuit was filed in January against a bank for the same reason in the Berlin district court. The management firm announced on 26 October that it would be liquidating the fund, whose shares are currently trading at EUR18.30 each on the secondary market on the Hamburg stock exchange, for a cash value of 27.50%. According to hrp, subscribers, who for two years have been subject to a freeze on redemptions, will most likely see a loss of over 50% on their investment. Peter Hahn, a partner at hrp, claims that the P2 Value will cause losses for more than a million subscribers. The heavy losses of the fund will affect at least 13 real estate funds of funds. However, the lawyer expects that many banks and savings banks which sold shares in the P2 Value fund would prefer to find a compromise with subscribers. But the most important thing is that the faith of investors not be shaken in the meanwhile by the prescription, and hence the necessity of the current lawsuit, due to the suspensive effect of such a disposition.
