Ossiam launches an investor confidence barometer


Ossiam, an asset management affiliate of Natixis Global Asset Management specialised in smart beta and strategy ETFs, has launched an investor confidence barometer of French institutional and retail investors. The barometer is based both on a survey of a panel of “finance experts” consisting of 89 professional financial analysts or active managers employed at financial sector institutions, a panel of “retail” investors, including 101 individual qualified investors who are active on financial markets. “European equities have posted the highest confidence score on the barometer,” the first edition of the barometer finds. “76% of finance experts say they are confident in the rise of this asset class over the next 12 months, as well as 56% of retail investors surveyed,” Ossiam says. Conversely, hedge funds are seen as the riskiest asset class. Only 27% of experts and retail investors are confident in their rise in the next 12 months.
