Le Temps reports that Alexandre Michellod is leaving Wegelin & Co. Michellos, who is a board member at the private bank for French-speaking Switzerland and in charge of semi-institutional management, will be leaving his job at the end of December. After participating in the establishment and development of the bank in Geneva and in French-speaking Switzerland, where it now employs about 70 people, and in the creation and development of the semi-institutional management unit, the banker will be leaving the firm to undertake new “entrepreneurial projects,” he has told Le Temps, though he released no details about the nature of those projects.
