Islamic finance promises strong growth


Agefi reports that the debt crisis may lead to a virtual doubling of assets in Islamic finance, to USD1.8trn by 2016, according to a study by Deutsche Bank. The Islamic bond (sukuk) industry, which measures USD50bn and currently represents 1% of total debt issues, is attracting a growing number of issuers. Market liquidity has awakened the interest of top-calibre actors, such as Goldman Sachs, which has recently created a USD2bn sukuk programme.
