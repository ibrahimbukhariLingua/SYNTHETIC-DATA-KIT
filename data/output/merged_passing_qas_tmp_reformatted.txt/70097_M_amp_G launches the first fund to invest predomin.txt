The diversified fund aims to provide investors with regular income and a total return in excess of public bonds.The £44.5 million M&G Impact Financing Fund has participated in several private and illiquid debt deals. These include lending to the developer behind the major regeneration of the Greenwich Peninsula in London, supporting solar power in the US and providing finance to UK housing associations. These deals will directly help build houses, provide employment and reduce CO2 emissions.M&G has worked with Sustainalytics, a provider of sustainability research, in order to devise a methodology to assess and measure the impact of the fund’s investments. M&G Prudential, Big Society Capital and The Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research are all seed investors in the fund.Evita Zanuso, Financial Sector & Investor Engagement Director, Big Society Capital, says: “We are very excited M&G has launched this long term debt fund that puts social and environmental impact at its core and has great potential to scale and replicate. Big Society Capital is keen to support M&G in bringing impact investment to institutional investors and that’s why we have invested £15 million from our Treasury portfolio as an early seed investor in this fund.”
