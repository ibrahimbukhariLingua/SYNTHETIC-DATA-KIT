Partner at East Capital joins Ukrainian government


East Capital partner Aivaras Abromavicius has been appointed Minister of Economic Development and Trade in the new Ukrainian government. Aivaras Abromavicius’ new role is not combinable with his active role in East Capital and he will therefore resign from his position as senior advisor and partner. Jacob Grapengiesser, also senior advisor and partner, has worked closely with Aivaras Abromavicius for twelve years and will take the lead role for Eastern European investments while the overall responsibility remains with CIO and chairman, Peter Elam Håkansson. The Eastern European Public Equity investment team of East Capital is made up of 14 individuals and the funds and separate accounts have, since the start in 1997, been team managed.“I have been working in emerging and frontier markets nearly all my life, but this opportunity is a once in a lifetime one. I am truly passionate about Ukraine, the country that has been my and my family’s home for the past six years. East Capital has given me a lot over the past years, and now it is my time to contribute to the development of Ukraine”, said Aivaras Abromavicius.Mr Abromavicius comes from Lithuania and is married to a Ukrainian national.
