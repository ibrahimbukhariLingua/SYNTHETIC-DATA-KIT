AFG publishes proposals to increase long-term savings


The French financial management association AFG on 1 June published its proposals to promote an increase of long-term savings, as these savings finance the economy and prepare the population for retirement. “The problem is not our savings rates per se, which are at a good level compared with Europe overall. It is rather the way in which these savings are invested which is cause for concern,” the president of the AFG, Paul-Henri de la Porte du Theil, said yesterday. Less than one in four French citizens owns either publicly traded or private equities. More homegeneity in the tax rates applicable to savings could correct these anomalies. In terms of private equity, the association claims that savings investors should be encouraged to invest in FIP or FCPI funds to channel their capital towards small and mid-sized businesses. For publicly-traded equities, the AFG claims that savers should be encouraged to purchase unit-linked life insurance policies investing in equities, and that tax rates for equities OPCVM funds should be brought into line with the rates applicable to directly held equities. Meanwhile, to encourage businesses to help their employees to prepare for retirement, corporate savings products (Perco, Pere, etc.) should not be subject to 4% social security contributions.
