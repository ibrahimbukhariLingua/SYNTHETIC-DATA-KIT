Major German management firms on the defensive


In the first four months of the year, Deka (savings banks) has seen net redemptions of EUR3.5bn from open-ended securities funds. At Allianz Global Investors (AGI) and Union Investment (co-operative banks), net outflows have totalled EUR1.7bn and EUR556m. Only DWS (Deutsche Bank) has managed to attract net subscriptions, of EUR390m, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. The four main asset management firms in the country together account for 70% of the market, but the foreign competition is trying to catch up with them, attracted by the weakness of the German model, which is based excessively on captive networks. However, not all foreign management firms are making inroads. Despite their good product line, Pictet has only EUR31.6m in assets, according to BVI statistics. Entering the German market isnâ€™t easy, since you need about EUR800,000 per year for costs in order to open a small distribution office in Germany, meaning that the minimal assets to cover those costs are about EUR100m. It may be far more, since German investors prefer bond funds, which earn less in commissions, and are less enthusiastic for newcits, emerging markets corporate debt, or Asian small caps, which are more lucrative for asset management firms.
