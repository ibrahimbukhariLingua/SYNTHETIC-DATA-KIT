Foreign firms interested in BHF-Bank


FT Deutschland reports that BHF-Bank, which Deutsche Bank inherited last year with its acquisition of Sal. Oppenheim, but which it would like to sell on, appears to be attracting considerable interest from foreign investors. Among the candidates to buy the business are the Liechtenstein bank LGT, the French bank BNP Paribas, and the Swiss private bank Julius BÃ¤r. Other potential buyers mentioned by the newspaper are Permira, Apollo, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR).
