Allianz GI CEO predicts that appetite for risk will return


In an interview with Il Sole - 24 Ore, Elizabeth Corley, CEO of Allianz Global Investors Europe, says institutional investors remain prudent, but that they have some inclination to invest in higher-risk investments. She says “the big question at the moment is the implications of the financial crisis for the real economy, while from a mid-term perspective, the largest fear is the return of inflation … To combat inflation, managers will need to guarantee capital growth and increase the level of risk in their portfolio.”
