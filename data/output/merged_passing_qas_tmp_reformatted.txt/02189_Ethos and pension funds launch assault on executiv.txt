Ethos and pension funds launch assault on executive pay scales


Activist shareholder Ethos and eight Swiss pension funds Thursday launched a fresh attempt to allow shareholders to curb executive pay at large Swiss companies, says the Wall Street Journal. Ethos filed a say-on-pay resolution for the shareholder meetings at Holcim, Swiss Reinsurance and Zurich Financial Services. Pension funds Aargauische Pensionskasse, Luzerner Pensionskasse, Pensionskasse Post and Pictet Funds SA have backed the resolution.
