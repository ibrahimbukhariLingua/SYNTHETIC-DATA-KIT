BlackRock in a hurry to conclude acquisition of BGI


The Financial Times reports that BlackRock on Sunday was scrambling to conclude its acquisition of Barclays Global Investors, to prevent Bank of New York Mellon from entering the running. Barclays is supposed to take a decision early this week about who will be chosen to buy BGI. If BlackRock is selected, Barclays would acquire a stake of up to 20% in the US management firm, the FT reports.
