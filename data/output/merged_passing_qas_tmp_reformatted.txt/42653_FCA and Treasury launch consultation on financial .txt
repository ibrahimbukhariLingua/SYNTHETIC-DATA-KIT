FCA and Treasury launch consultation on financial advising


The British Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on 12 October announced that they are launching a joint consultation to explore ways to improve access for clients of financial advising.As part of the consultation, which represents the first stage in work begun in early August as part of the Financial Advice Market Review, questions will establish largely whether differences exist between the financial advising desired by clients, and the financial advising currently available. The question is also asked as to whether technical advances, such as “robo-advisers,” are like to improve access to financial advising.“The financial decisions which clients take can have impacts over the very long term. It is important for this market to provide accessible and approachable advising when clients need it. This consultation provides a way for the FCA, the government, professionals in the secftor and consumers to work together to propose solutions which meed the needs of clients,” says Tracey McDermott, CEO of the FCA, cited in a statement.The consultation will remain open until 22 December, and a summary report will be released before the presentation of the 2016 budget, a statement from the FCA says.
