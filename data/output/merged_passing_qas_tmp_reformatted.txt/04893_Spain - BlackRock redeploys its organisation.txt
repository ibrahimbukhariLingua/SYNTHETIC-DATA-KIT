Spain - BlackRock redeploys its organisation


BlackRock has appointed Armando Senra as director for Spain and Portugal, with the mission of developing the institutional client base in these countries, Funds People reports. Currently, 88% of activities in Spain are retail. Senra replaces Delfina PÃ©rez, who has held the position in the interim since the resignation of Gonzalo Azcoitia. He will divide his time between Madrid and New York.The move is a part of a larger strategic reorganisation for the US-based management firm, with the creation of a unit which groups together the Iberian peninsula and Latin America, so that Spain no longer depends on the Southern European region. Senra and his seven partners in Spain will work with the team in New York in charge of Latin America. For Chile, Peru, Mexico and Brazil, BlackRock will now concentrate its efforts on retail clients, where it was previously focused on institutional investors.
