CFA Institute proposes alternatives to bonus limits for managers


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } The members of the CFA Institute estimate that bonus limits, on the model of those at banks, when applied to fund managers in the European Union, would have the effect of “carving remuneration rules in stone,” which could “disadvantage investors and indirectly damage compromise between the interests of managers and investors.”Although limiting bonuses does not appear to be the right solution, the CFA Institute is providing a list of several areas to explore: Defer remuneration for a longer time and extend the reference period to calculate the variable portion of remuneration. Claw back bonuses from asset managers to guarantee symmetrical performance commissions, in order to reduce overall costs when funds underperform their benchmark index. Increased transparency in the area of bonuses and premiums so as to allow end investors to compare and make informed decisions about the funds in which they invest. “High watermark” thresholds (all-time high points) so that fund managers do not receive large sums of money for poor results. For example, if a manager loses money in a given period, he should not receive a performance commission when the fund tops its previous peak Personal investment by the managers in their own funds, in order to ensure better alignment of their own interests with those of their clients (reinvestment in funds and partnership structres).
