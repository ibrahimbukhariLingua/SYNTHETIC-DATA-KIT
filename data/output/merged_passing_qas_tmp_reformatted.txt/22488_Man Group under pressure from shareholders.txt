Man Group under pressure from shareholders


Ten major shareholders in Man Group have asked its CEO, Peter Clarke, to make changes at the hedge fund firm, the Financial Times reports. If he does not do so, they will seek his resignation. The investors have given the director a “window” of time to bring the share price back up from 11-year lows this month. The firm has also seen a steep fall in its assets under management.
