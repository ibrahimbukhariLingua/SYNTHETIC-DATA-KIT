Mary Jo White to leave SEC


Donald Trump can be pleased. Mary Jo White, the head of the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC), on Monday night announced her forthcoming departure, after slightly less than four years as head of the institution. This leaves an opportunity for the new tenant in the White House to appoint a personality more in keeping with his programme of deregulatoin of the financial sector, or at least relaxation of regulation. White will leave the office at the end fo the term of Barack Obama, to come in mid-January. White began in the role in April 2013, and put in place some of the strictest financial reform rules of the Dodd-Franck law passed after the 2008 financial crisis. She also pushed for stricter regulation of the asset management sector and a profound reform of the functioning of money market funds. “My duty has been to ensure that the SEC passes safe protections for investors and markets, and that it establish the solid foundations for future progress in very sensitive areas such as regulation in asset management,” she says in a statement.
