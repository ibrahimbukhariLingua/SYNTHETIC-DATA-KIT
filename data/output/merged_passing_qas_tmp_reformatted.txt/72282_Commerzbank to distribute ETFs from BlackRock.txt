Commerzbank to distribute ETFs from BlackRock


Commerzbank has announced that it has signed a distribution agreement with the asset management giant BlackRock. Since the beginning of the month, the German bank has been offering its “Index-Invest” investment solution, multi-asset class funds from BlackRock, composed exclusively of ETFs and tracker funds. Index-Invest has about 50 ETF and tracker funds on the global markets. The ratings agency Scope in early 2018 gave its top A rating to the range of more or less aggressive strategies offered by Index-Invest, Commerzbank says in a statement.
