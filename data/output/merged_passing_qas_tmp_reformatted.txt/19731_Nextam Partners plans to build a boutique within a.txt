Nextam Partners plans to build a boutique within a boutique


The Italian asset management industry is hostage to traditional models, according to the independent asset management firm Nextam Partners. 97% of the sector is controlled by insurers and banks, Investment Europe notes. In order to stand out in this market, the strategy of Nextam is to “create a boutique within a boutique,” its CEO, Carlo Gentili, explans. The firm is outsourccing management of its funds to other asset management firms (Citic, Mario Gabelli, Bestinver, etc.) In April this year, Nextam launched an incubation Sicav entitled Mantex. The structure of the fund of funds is designed to attract managers who are hoping to start up their activities without worrying about administration.
