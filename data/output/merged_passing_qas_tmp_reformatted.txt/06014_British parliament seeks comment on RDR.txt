British parliament seeks comment on RDR


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Treasury Select Committee, the Parliamentary financial surveillance committee, has called for written comments on the Retail Distribution Review (RDR), especially in relation to two questions: Will the RDR achieve the desired results? And may these results be achieved by other, potentially better means? Before the commission announced the initiative, the director of the FSA, Hector Sants, said in a hearing that the RDR has three major objectives: to install a more transparent and equitable remuneration system, better training of advisors, and lastly, a clarification of the various categories of advising offered to clients. The consultation will remain open until 17 January.
