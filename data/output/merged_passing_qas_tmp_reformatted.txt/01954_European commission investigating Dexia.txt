European commission investigating Dexia


La Tribune reports that Dexia is currently awaiting the conclusions of an investigation by the European Commission to determine whether public funds received by the bank led to a distortion of free competition on the market. Meanwhile, the bank has chosen to “keep a low profile and limit its development,” the newspaper notes, pointing to its recent sale of 20% of Crédit du Nord to Société Générale.
