Richard Walsh leaves Lombard Odier IM


Richard Walsh, the head of emerging debt at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, is leaving the firm after one year. This departure comes at a time when LOIM is strengthening its London-based fixed income expertise by re-locating its emerging market debt team there from Geneva in October 2011. The team will also be reinforced by the appointment of senior portfolio manager Michal Wozniak of JP Morgan, who co-manages an emerging market debt portfolio at JPMorgan Asset Management in London in a team responsible for USD14 billion.LOIM’s credit team made the transition to London in August 2010. Stéphane Monier will remain based in Geneva and be supported from London by Ian Clarke, Deputy Chief Investment Officer for the unit who joined in June 2011 after working as head of fixed income at Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. Michal Wozniak, working with co-fund manager Guilherme Maciel De Barros, will take over management of the LOF Emerging Local Currencies and Bond Fund and the LOF Emerging Market Bond fund. They will be supported by Laurent Moulin, LOIM’s fixed income economist. Richard Walsh was also involved in managing these funds since joining the firm last year.
