Stock market for funds in development


L’Echo reports that Clearstream is at work on creating a stock market for investment funds. The Luxembourg chamber of compensation (owned by Deutsche Börse) is testing a new system, Emporium, which would eliminate intermediary costs between asset management firms and final investors, who would have access to a platform of 77,000 European funds. The testing phase is planned for September, says Philippe Seyll, director of investment fund services at Clearstream.
