John Bennett joins Gartmore


Roger Guy and Guillaume Rambourg will hand over most of their responsibilities in retail fund management at Gartmore to John Bennett, who has been recruited from GAM, where he was manager of the Star Continental European Equity Fund. Bennett, who will begin in his new role in early 2010, will be in charge of the European Select Opportunties Fund (GBP1.5bn); he will also be in charge of developing a range of pan-European products. He will report to Dominic Rossi, CIO of Gartmore, MoneyMarketing reports. Guy and Rambourg, for their part, will apparently remain at Gartmore, and will continue to manage the long/short European Absolute Return fund, launched in January, and three institutional hedge funds.
