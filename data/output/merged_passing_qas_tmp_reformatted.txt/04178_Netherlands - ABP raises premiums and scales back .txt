Netherlands - ABP raises premiums and scales back benefits


The pension fund ABP suffered a 20% decline in its assets in 2008 to EUR173bn, while liabilities rose 38% to EUR193bn. Its coverage ratio came out to 89.5% at the end of December, compared with 140% one year earlier, the Wall Street Journal reports. As a result, ABP (2.5 million pension holders in public service and teaching) will be raising its premiums by 1% on 1 July, and a further 2% on 1 January 2010, which will bring in EUR5bn over five years, and will increase the coverage ratio above the legal limit of 105% in 2012, from 83% at the end of February. Meanwhile, until 2013, ABP will not compensate pension benefits for inflation. These payments will partly recommence in 2013, and will not be fully re-established until the coverage rate for the fund has risen above 135%.
