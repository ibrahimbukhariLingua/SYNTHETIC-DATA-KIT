PetraPflaum, chief financial officer responsible for DWS, says: “Our newratings system allows us to better differentiate equity and bondissuers according to their contribution to improving the world.”The17 sustainable development goals of the United Nations concerneconomic development, social inclusion and environmental challenges.They are based on developed and developing countries. The data takeninto account by DWS include environmental, social and governance(ESG) criteria defined by MSCI. These are used to measure whetherproducts and services from each company contribute to one or moreSDGs. Depending on the results, DWS identifies companies in equityand bond makrets which contribute to achieving global objectives.DWSalso takes wider ESG criteria into consideration to avoid limitingthemselves to too narrow an investment spectrum. DWS has published arecent report analysing a wide range of stock market indices, so asto evaluate the point at which procucts and services of companieswhich make them up make a positive contribution, or otherwise, to theachievement of SDGs. For all markets studied, fewer than half ofunderlying companies meet these objectives directly.Anotherapproach takes into account sustainable development objectives andthe objectives of sovereign funds, with an investment spectrumlimited to governments that protect and strengthen political andcivil rights for their citizens. THe ratings system at DWS rankscountries according to human rights, prohibition of the deathpenalty, level of corruption, nature of the political regime,military spending, and prohibition of nuclear weapons.
