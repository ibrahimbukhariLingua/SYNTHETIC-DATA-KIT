Evli changes TPMs in France


Evli Funds, the wholly owned asset management firm of the Finnish bank Evli, has just partnered with the third-party marketer (TPM) Blue Associates to sell its funds in France, replacing Compagnie Financière Jacques Cœur, who had been its partner since 2015. Blue Associates was established last year by Denis Chasteauneuf and Christian de Bausset, both formerly of Barings in Paris. The boutique works with several other asset managers, including Tareno, a Swiss firm that manages a water fund, and Baker Steel, which specialises in natural resources. With Evli, Blue Associates is adding a Nordic string to its bow. Evli Funds managed €11.9bn as of the end of March 2019, mainly for institutional investors. The Finnish asset manager offers 27 UCITS in three areas – corporate bonds (its core business, with €6bn), global equities, and factor investment funds. Strategies focus on northern Europe with a long-standing ESG (environmental, social and governance) approach. Nine out of 10 funds in this range are registered in France. Evil Funds’ growth has been driven by international expansion in recent years. Since 2012, its international business has expanded by 27.2% to €2.1bn of the €8.1bn managed by its funds. By way of comparison, Finnish AuM has expanded by just 12.8%. To expand outside Finland, the firm has chosen to work with partners except in other northern European countries. Its biggest international markets are Spain, Germany and Sweden, said Petter von Bonsdorff, a partner in charge of international development, who was recently in Paris. It hopes that France will soon join this group of countries. This change comes as Aktia Asset Management, another Finnish asset manager, arrives on the French market, advised by CFJC.
