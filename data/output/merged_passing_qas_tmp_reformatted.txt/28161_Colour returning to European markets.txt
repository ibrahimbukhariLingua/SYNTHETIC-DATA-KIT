Colour returning to European markets


A return to «the good old days» is not on the cards yet, but Europe appears to be in recovery mode, according to the latest issue of The Cerulli Edge-Europe Edition. This confirms the rise in optimism in European investors observed in the latest Manager Survey of BofA Merrill Lynch."Allocators have turned bullish on Europe as quick as they have turned bearish on emerging markets and China,» commented Barbara Wall, director at Cerulli Associates. «They even like European banks-albeit on a selective basis. It is sensible to be cautious. Bottom-up stock picking will dominate a market that is still jittery."While allocators and active managers are more chipper about European stock prices, fund buyers are not fully on message. Equity flows are still outweighed by much larger flows to bond funds. Surprisingly, the most upbeat would appear to be Spanish investors, who poured EUR232.4 million (USD308 million) into local equity markets during the first five months of the year, notes Cerulli."It is difficult to predict when Europe’s love affair with bonds will fizzle out, but investors need to be disciplined as new issuances surge,» cautioned Yoon Ng, a Cerulli associate director. «The European high-yield market has grown fast-and flabby at the edges. Benchmark huggers face losses and liquidity constraints if outflows pick up. A strategic rethink may be necessary to avoid being caught out."Separately, Cerulli thinks that European real estate could be a strong investment theme over the next 12 months. British property equity funds report resurgent interest, particularly for portfolios focused on London and the South East. Even the German open-end property market seems on the mend.
