Noël Amenc touts development of closed funds


In an interview with La Tribune, Noël Amenc, director of the Edhec-Risk Institute, backs the development of closed funds. He says one of the basic ruled in risk management for a collective placement organism (OPC) is to find a good balance between asset allocation strategies and liabilities, particularly in terms of the duration of investments and of liquidity more generally. For open funds, liabilities may at any time render this balance impossible for investment strategies whose performance depends on a comparatively long investment horizon, or which are based on less liquid assets, such as real estate or shares in non-publicly traded companies.
