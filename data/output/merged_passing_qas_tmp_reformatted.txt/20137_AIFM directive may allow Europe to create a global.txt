AIFM directive may allow Europe to create a global brand


The Luxembourg investment fund association (ALFI), represented by its director general, Camille Thommes, claims that the AIFM directive “represents a unique opportunity for Europe to create a global brand on the alternative investment market, inspired by UCITS. With AIFMD, the European Union is creating the first regulatory framework for alternative investments worldwide.”As the Luxembourg Finance ministry has recently submitted its proposed transposition of the directive to Luxembourg’s legislature, “ALFI welcomes the ambition of the Luxembourg government to open the way to becoming one of the first member countries to transpose this directive.”The professional association also notes that the proposed Luxembourg legislation has two major characteristics which will be likely to inspire professional interest on the part of alternative management professionals. On the one hand, the creation of a special limited partnership company, which complements fund product ranges with a flexible and safe partnership relationship, will be particularly suitable for investors who are used to this structure inspired by the Anglo-American partnership model. The proposed legislation also clarifies the tax regime for capital gains.
