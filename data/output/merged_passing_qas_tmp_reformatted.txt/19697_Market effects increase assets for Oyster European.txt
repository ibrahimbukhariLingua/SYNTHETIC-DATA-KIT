Market effects increase assets for Oyster European Opportunities


Due to its performance, the Oyster European Opportunities fund from Syz & Co, managed by Eric Bendahan, has managed to win the loyalty of its investors since the beginning of this year. The fund has gained about 20% year to date, which represents a lead of 5 Â½% compared with its peer group, and the manager announced in a presentation in Paris that assets now total about EUR1.25bn, compared with EUR1.01bn as of the end of 2011. The Stoxx Europe 600, its benchmark index, for its part, has gained 12.84%.The portfolio, 70% of whose outperformance comes from genuinely family-owned businesses, and 90% of which comes from stock-picking generally, has been gradually rebalanced over the course of this year, reducing the weight of growth stocks in order to increase the proportion of value shares.The new Oyster European Selection fund (see Newsmanagers of 1 December and 17 January), which is aimed at institutional investors (minimal subscription: EUR1m), has already attracted EUR55m. It is a more concentrated version of the Opportunities (70-90 holdings), with a portfolio of 40-50 positions.
