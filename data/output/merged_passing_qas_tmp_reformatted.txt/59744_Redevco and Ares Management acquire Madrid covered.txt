The vendor is a consortium of private Spanish investors. The site is classed as a Spanish historic monument. “The acquisition of the Mercado San Miguel reflects our vision of the future of commerce, taking consumers beyond a simple transaction to offer them the pleasure of an experience they want to share. This architectural jewel near the finest attractions of Madrid is a landmark in the city, where visitors come to shop and taste a range of exceptional foods. We are planning to increase returns from operations via active management of asets and improvement of the customer experience,” says Andrew Vaughan, chairman and CEO at Redevco. The statement adds that Ares and Redevco announced the creation of Redevco Iberian Ventures in September 2015, targeting an investment of EUR500m in commercial real estate on the Iberian peninsula. The announcement today follows a recent sale of a portfolio of nine commercial parks in Spain to Vukile Property last month, and in May 2017, the sale of the Portimao commercial park in Portugal to Olimpo Real Estate SOCIMI S.A.
