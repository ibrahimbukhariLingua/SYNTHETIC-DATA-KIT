FINRA warns retail investors against leveraged ETFs


The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has posted an announcement on its website reminding brokers and registered investment advisors of their fiduciary obligations, the Wall Street Journal reports. The authority points out that ETFs which are leveraged or which aim to generate performance inverse to the index they replicate are complex instruments and are typically unsuitable for retail investors who are planning to hold their investments for more than one trading day.
