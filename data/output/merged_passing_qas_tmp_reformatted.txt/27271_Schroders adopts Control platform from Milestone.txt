Schroders adopts Control platform from Milestone


According to Das Investment, Schroders may soon be able to automatically verify the net asset value of its approcimately 1,400 funds within 45 minutes, instead of manually reporting them in spreadsheets. To achieve this, the British asset management firm will use the pControl platform from the software provider Milestone, which allows it to automate the task. Schroders will thus come into compliance with new regulatory requirements.
