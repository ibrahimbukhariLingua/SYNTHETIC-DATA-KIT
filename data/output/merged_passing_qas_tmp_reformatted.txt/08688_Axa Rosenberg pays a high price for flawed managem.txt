Axa Rosenberg pays a high price for flawed management process


In the wake of an error identified in the risk management process in connection with stock-picking for a fund from Axa Rosenberg, Thomas Mead, head of research at the management firm, will resign at some time this year, providing the firm time to find a successor for him. Barr Rosenberg, chairman and director of research, has decided to retire within 30 days. Axa Rosenberg has also engaged the services of independent experts to evaluate whether the anomaly detected in the quantitative model had an impact on stock-picking or on the performance of the fund. The management firm has informed affected investors by letter and telephone.
