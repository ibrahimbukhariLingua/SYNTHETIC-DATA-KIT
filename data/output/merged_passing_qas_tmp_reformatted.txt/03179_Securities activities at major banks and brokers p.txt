Securities activities at major banks and brokers past low point


Securities activities at major international banks and brokers have already passed the low point in the current crisis, Standard & Poor’s estimates in a report published on 25 June (Global Banks’ and Brokers’ Securities-Related Businesses Appear To Be Past The Trough, But Improvement Will Be Gradual), which adds that, as its title indicates, a return to better times will be gradual. “We believe that fourth quarter 2008 probably marked the low point for trading activities of these banks, and that first quarter 2009 was the low point for their investment banking, asset management and wealth management activities,” says Scott Sprinzen, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor’s.
