Asset management boutique Agathon Invest founded


Two executives from Deka Investment and HSBC Global Asset Management, Michael Hallacker and Erich Schilcher, have gone independent to found the management firm Agathon Investment in Frankfurt. The firm will specialise in bonds and currencies. The two men will be joined by Christian Schiweck, former star manager from Deka and DWS, who last year bought a stake in the London-based management boutique MT Thaler, and who manages the Luxembourg fund m4 Alpha Bonds from Alceda Fund Management, which is advised by Agathon Invest. Agathon Invest, which is planning to specialise in serving institutional investors in the German-speaking countries, will launch open-ended funds and Spezialfonds; it will also accept mandates.
