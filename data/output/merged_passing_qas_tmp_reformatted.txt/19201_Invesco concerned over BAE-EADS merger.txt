Invesco concerned over BAE-EADS merger


Invesco Perpetual, the largest shareholder in BAE Systems with over 13% of capital, will on Monday publicly express its concerns about a planned merger of the defence group with EADS, the Financial Times reports. The asset management firm, which has retained the merger and acquisition boutique Ondra Partners to advise it, does not understand the strategic logic of the deal. The firm feels that BAE Systems could diversify without merging, and that the merger would challenge the unique and privileged position of the group on the US defence market.
