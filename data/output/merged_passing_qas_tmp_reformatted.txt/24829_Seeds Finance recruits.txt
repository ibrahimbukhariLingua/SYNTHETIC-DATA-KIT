Seeds Finance recruits


After a period of integration into the Morningstar group, which has now concluded, Seeds Finance has announced that it is planning to take a step forward in its development as a platform for European expertise for the group in the areas of institutional investors (Solvency 2, etc), risk control and alternative strategies. In order to enter this new development phase, Seeds Finance has added to its teams, with the arrival of two people, Christophe Tardy and CÃ©cile Astier. Tardy, currently director of strategy and projects at Morningstar France, a position he has held since April 2011, becomes deputy CEO of Seeds Finance, in charge of development in France and French-speaking Switzerland. Astier, who began in her position on 9 January, comes as an addition to consultant teams, contributing her expertise in hedge fund strategies and fixed income instruments. Astier managed the hedge fund analysis team at Lyxor AM for five years (fixed income, credit and volatility strategies). Tanguy de Lauzon gets a promotion as part of the reshuffle, and becomes deputy CEO of Seeds Finance, in charge of advising activities. De Lauzon, currently director of alternative management and fund selection, joined the team at Seeds Finance more than three years ago, after eight years spent at SGAM AI as a manager and hedge fund analyst. Alban Duchaine, director of client services and risk control, will receive additional responsibilities. Duchaine will coordinate the various advising offerings from Seeds Finance to institutional investors, particularly the Solvency 2 product range. Duchaine has been contributing to the development and success of Seeds Finance for over 5 years.
