Countrywide acquisition will cost Bank of America very dear


As expected, Bank of America (BofA) on Wednesday announced a USD8.5bn compromise with investors [including BlackRock, Pimco and MetLife -ed] who lost money on mortgage-backed securities issued by Countrywide before the collapse of the residential real estate market, the Wall Street Journal reports. BofA has held a majority stake in Countrywide since 2007, and took complete control of the company in 2008.In addition to buying back USD5.5bn in “defective” mortgage-backed securities in the future, BofA will write down USD6.6bn for lawsuits still to come and one-time charges for its real estate operation. Thus, Bank of America is projecting a total loss in second quarter of USD8.6bn to USD9.1bn.
