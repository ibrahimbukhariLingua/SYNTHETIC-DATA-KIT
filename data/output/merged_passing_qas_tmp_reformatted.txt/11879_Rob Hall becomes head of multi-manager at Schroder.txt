Rob Hall becomes head of multi-manager at Schroders


Schroders has appointed Rob Hall as head of multi-manager, reporting to Johanna Kyrklund, head of multi-asset investments. He joined Schroders in March 2011 in the position of head of manager selection. In his new capacity as head of multi-manager, Rob Hall will continue to be head of manager selection while taking on additional responsibilities for portfolio management and client service. As a result, he will co-manage the three multi-manager funds: Schroders Cautious Managed, Schroders Strategic Balanced and Schroders High Alpha Funds, alongside fund manager, Jane Turner, who has been involved in managing the funds since 2005. The changes follow the restructuring of Schroders GBP35bn multi-asset team in March this year, which saw the multi-manager team combined with the multi-asset team under the direction of Johanna Kyrklund. The team now consists of 70 investment professionals globally.
