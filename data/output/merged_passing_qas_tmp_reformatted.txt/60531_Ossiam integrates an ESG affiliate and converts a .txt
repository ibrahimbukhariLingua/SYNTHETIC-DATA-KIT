Ossiam integrates an ESG affiliate and converts a fund to physical replication


Ossiam, the ETF specialist asset management firm of the Natixis Global Asset Mangement group, has announced a change in investment policy for its fund Ossiam US Minimum Variance NR, which becomes Ossiam US Mimumum Variance ESO NR.The Ossiam US Minimum Variance ESG NR fund now replicates the performance of the US ESG Minimum Variance Index NR both up and down. The index is calculated and published by the index provider Solactive, and is based on ESG data provided by Sustainalytics.The index reflects the performance of a dynamic sample of equities from the Solactive US Large Cap index which satisfy ESG and weighting criteria in such a way as to minimise the volatility of the portfolio. The Solactive US Large Cap index reflects the performance of about 500 large US companies.An ESG filter is applied each month to the data provided by Sustainalytics for the shares of the investment universe. The filter is used to select the best-rated companies in terms of environmental, social and governance criteria.The replication method for the fund is also based on physical replication. The currency of reference for the fund remains the US dollar.“This evolution follows an engagement by Ossiam for an environmental, social and governance (ESG) process which is voluntary, and which was scaled up in 2016 as the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment was signed,” a statement says.
