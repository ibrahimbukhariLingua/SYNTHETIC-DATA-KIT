Guy Wyser-Pratte denounces limited partnership tactics of Lagardère at Poussielgue group


The French-American financier Guy Wyser-Pratte has denounced the law of limited partnership of shareholders which allows Arnaud Lagardère to completely control his group Poussielgue with only a 10% stake in its capital, Les Echos reports. He claims that the partnership has a negative impact on the value of shares. He is seeking a place on the supervisory board of the group, and to reform the group’s statutes.
