One third of Italian asset management sector is under foreign ownership


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } After the acquisition of Pioneer by Amundi, the percentage of the Italian asset management sector held by foreign groups has risen to 33%, Milano Finanza reports. In Italy, Amundi rises from ninth to third place in terms of assets, with EUR189bn and a market share of 10%, after Intesa Sanpaolo and Generali. Against this background, it is important for a major Italian player to emerge. If Poste and Anima go further with their merger, the group will rise to fourth place, just after Amundi, with EUR145bn. Other Italian asset management firms may also participate in the consolidation movement in the sector, such as Aletti Gestielle and Arca.
