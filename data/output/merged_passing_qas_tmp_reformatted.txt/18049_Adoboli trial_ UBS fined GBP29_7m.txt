Adoboli trial: UBS fined GBP29.7m


After a consultation with the Federal financial market surveillance authority (Finma), the British financial services authority (FSA) ordered the Swiss bank UBS to pay a fine of GBP29.7m (CHF44.2m) as part of the Adoboli case, Finma announced in a statement on 26 november. Finma says in its report that trading losses at UBS in London revealed significant shortfalls in risk management and control mechanisms at the UBS investment bank. According to Finma, if it were not for those shortfalls, fraudulent transactions by the trader in question would have been discovered sooner. As soon as it became aware of unauthorised operations, Finma ordered preventive measures in order to limit operating risks for UBS. At the end of the procedure, Finma appointed an independent third party to control the implementation of corrective measures.
