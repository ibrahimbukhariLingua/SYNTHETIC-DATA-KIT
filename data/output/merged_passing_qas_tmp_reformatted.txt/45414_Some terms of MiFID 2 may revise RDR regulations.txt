Some terms of MiFID 2 may revise RDR regulations


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } RDR regulations may be revised in the light of the terms of the MiFID 2 directive, in order to correct “anomalies” in the British tax regime, the British wealth management association states. In a response to a working document by the British regulator about its approach and implementation of the European directive, released in March this year, the professional association notes that in the chapter on independent advising, RDR regulations would be replaced by the terms laid out in the European directive. “The terms of MiFID 2 are comparable to those of the RDR regulations, but no longer reliably reflect the way in which independent advising is offered on the market,” the British professional association says. The association also emphasizes that there is a lack of information about some investment products, such as structured products. The British association claims, however, that the European directive also presents some areas of concern. Among the issues cited are excessive costs associated with telephone recordings, which are supposed to be retained for five to seven years.
