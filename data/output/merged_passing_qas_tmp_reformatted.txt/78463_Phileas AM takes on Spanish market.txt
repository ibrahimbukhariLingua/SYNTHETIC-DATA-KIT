Phileas AM takes on Spanish market


The Paris-based alternative asset management firm Phileas Asset Management is continuing its tour of Europe. After Switzerland in November and Germany in December last year, Phileas Asset Management in early March received a license from the Spanish financial market regulator, CNMV, to sell its Phileas Long/Short Europe fund in Spain. “We responded to demand from clients who wanted to invest in our long/short fund. In Spain, we are primarily aimed at retail and private banking markets,” Phileas Asset Management tells NewsManagers. The fund, managed by the co-founders of the boutique, Ludovic Labal and Cyril Bertrand, was also registered on the Allfunds fund platform in January.
