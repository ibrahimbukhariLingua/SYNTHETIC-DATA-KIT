Axa IM designs methodology for analysing countries according to ESG criteria


Axa Investment Managers has developed a methodology to analyse countries according to environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, the asset management firm announced on Monday. The new analytical model is based on four criteria: political engagement, environment, social and governance. Each of these criteria is composed of several indicators, which must be objective and measurable, reviewed at least once per year, have a track record of at least 10 years, be global and measure the effectiveness or the results of a policy. For example, for the social criteria, Axa IM has selected information from the United Nations human development index. For the environment, the firm compares CO2 emissions per inhabitant of a country and per purchasing power parity-adjusted GDP. The methodology may be used in two different ways, depending on the desire of investors. The first one aims to reduce reputation risks in a universe dedicated to government bonds. To that end, Axa IM recommends a negative filtering approach. The asset management firm cites the example of a pension fund which wanted to reduce its reputation risks for an existing portfolio of emerging market government debt, focusing on corruption, political stability, and offshore havens. On the basis of an initial universe of 57 EMBIG countries, the reputation risk tool identified 10 government issuers who present a high risk, or 9.7% of the market capitalisation of the universe. The second application is to integrate ESG criteria into an existing portfolio. In another practical example, Axa IM points out that an ESG approach respecting precise risk criteria has an impact on geographic allocation, but improves the ESG performance of a portfolio while having a limited impact on quality or duration.
