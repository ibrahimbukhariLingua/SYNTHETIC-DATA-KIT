Tikehau IM and Groupama AM form strategic alliance


Unity is strength in asset management. Groupama Asset Management (Groupama AM) and Tikehau Investment Management (Tikehau IM) on 27 October announced that they have signed an industrial and commercial cooperation agreement. The agreement gives them “a means to outsource management, and to create products with co-branding and distribution agreements,” the two companies say in a joint statement. The partnership will also allow the two asset management firms to extend their product offerings in terms of asset classes, and thus to offer clients the expertise of both companies. “We are now seeking to consolidate our organic growth, and to project our activity into new areas of growth,” explains Philippe Setbon, CEO of Groupama AM, cited in a statement. “The partnership will allow us to increase our distribution capacity, and also to extend our asset management range of new asset classes, primarily including private equity. That will allow us to add to the porfolio of solutions we offer investors and distributors.” For his part, Thomas Friedberger, CEO and co-CIO at Tikehau IM, considers that “the management expertise and the investor bases at Groupama AM and Tikehau IM are complementary.” In his opinion, “this partnership aims to offer investors an extended range of solutions.” The partership does not involve mergers of teams, as “the two companies are working together but each on its own side,” a spokesperson for Tikehau IM has told NewsManagers. According to the same spokesperson, Groupama has also acquired a stake in the capital of the firm “in June or July,” but “for a very low amount and a very small percentage.”
