Fund managers make changes to their product ranges


As of the end of March, assets in equities funds had fallen 36% in one year, to EUR125bn, while bond fund assets had contracted 23% to EUR139bn. There is reason to believe, therefore, that revenues from management fees have fallen in the same proportions, while competition from ETFs is intensifying, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung notes. Many of the approximately 100 management firms active in Germany are probably in the red. Currently, the heads of these businesses are shutting down or merging funds wherever possible. Others, such as Union Investment or Metzler AM, are launching new protected-capital funds, which are relatively costly, but correspond to investor demand.
