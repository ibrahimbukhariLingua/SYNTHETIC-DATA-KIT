OMGI becomes Merian Global Investors


Old Mutual Global Investors (OMGI) has announced it will be renamed Merian Global Investors, effective from autumn 2018.The announcement follows the recent acquisition of the business by the OMGI management team and funds managed by TA Associates.The name is inspired by «the remarkable life of the scientist, artist and adventurer Maria Sibylla Merian. Born in Frankfurt in 1647, Merian is considered one of the first scientists to challenge and debunk widely believed myths about her discipline. She captured many of her scientific findings and observations in a series of exquisitely detailed illustrations and is often described as “the woman who made science beautiful.”", according to a press statement.The newly independent business believes there are many synergies between the pioneering work and character of Merian and its vision, values and culture. Further, «as a polymath, Merian embodied the multi-faceted approach OMGI takes to investment. With no centralised investment process or chief investment officer, the firm’s investment teams are free to pursue their own, proven strategies», according to OMGI.The business will continue to operate as Old Mutual Global Investors until the autumn, with the exact date of the renaming yet to be confirmed.OMGI has also today revealed additional details relating to the purchase of the business. Permanent employees are now participating in a remuneration structure that aligns them to the company’s long-term equity value, with members of the firm’s leadership team, including investment talent from across the business, directly invested in the firm. Further, OMGI has confirmed it now has the majority of voting rights, controlled by the six investors who led the buyout (Richard Buxton, Ian Heslop, Amadeo Alentorn, Mike Servent, Dan Nickols and Richard Watts) and the wider leadership team, with the remainder controlled by TA Associates. By offering employees the opportunity to benefit from the firm’s future growth, OMGI believes it is enhancing alignment of client and employee interests.
