BNY Mellon announces 2011 product range


During a recent visit to Paris by Alexander Gorra, director of the Brazilian platform BNY Mellon Arx (USD7.1bn as of the end of December), the former Paris office of BNY Mellon Asset Management has launched a promotion of an Irish-registered fund focused on Latin American infrastructure, the BNY Mellon Latin America Infrastructure fund (see Newsmanagers of 29 November 2010 and 11 January 2011), with assets of about USD22m, on the French market. The diversified product will be made available to institutionals as well as multi-managers and distributors.The Irish fund has a portfolio of about 35 positions, selected with a bottom-up approach, and, due to the nature of the sector, top-down analysis. In the selection of stocks, Alex Gerra will consider operators and providers of equipment equally, but clearly has a preference for Brazilian stocks, which account for 70% of the portfolio. Other countries present in the portfolio include Mexico, Chile and Peru.The other core areas of development for 2011 in France are continued sales efforts for the local currency emerging market debt fund BNY Mellon Emerging Markets Debt Local Currency Fund (from the affiliate Standish); the Global Real Return fund from Newton (see Newsmanagers of 24 March 2010), and absolute return strategies from the boutique Insight.
