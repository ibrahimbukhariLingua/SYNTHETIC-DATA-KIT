Novacap raises USD840m for a fund dedicated to new technologies


The Canadian venture capital firm Novacap on 20 July announced that it has closed the Novacap TMT V fund with USD840m in assets. “The fund has exceeded its target size of 40% as a result both of demand from longstanding investors and the entry of new investors,” the firm explains in a statement. The new fund brings total capital raised by Novacap since its creation in 1983 to over USD2.6bn. Assets under management now total USD2.26bn. Investors in the TMT V fund include public and corporate pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, foundations, family offices and individual investors throughout Canada, the United States, Europe and Australia. The vehicle will invest in a wide range of companies in the technology sector in Canada and the United States, concentrating on software, corporate and financial services, internet infrastructure, electronic commerce, and other specialist technological solutions for the energy and health sectors. The fund will make single investments of USD20m to USD100m “to support businesses with organic growth initiatives and to make strategic acquisitions,” Novacap says.
