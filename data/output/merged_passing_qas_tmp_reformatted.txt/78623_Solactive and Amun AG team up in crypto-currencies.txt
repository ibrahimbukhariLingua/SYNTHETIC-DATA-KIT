Solactive and Amun AG team up in crypto-currencies


The index specialist Solactive on Monday, 11 March announced that Amun AG, the issuer of the first two single-coin crypto-currency exchange traded products, Bitcoin (BTC) ETP and Ethereum (ETH) ETP, has selected the ETF Services department at Solactive to calculate its indicative optimised portfolio value (IOPV) and to create a portfolio composition profile. “This collaboration highlights Solactive’s ability to step beyond the capacities of conventional index providers, to handle exotic indices which are outside traditional asset classes such as equities and fixed income securities,” the firm says in a statement.
