Lombard Odier challenges Irving Picard’s demands


A lawsuit files on 6 June by Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee responsible for recuperating money for victims of the fraud orchestrated by Bernard Madoff from financial institutions, including the Geneva-based bank Lombard Odier, reveals that the executives of these institutions are not taking long to react. Although the liquidator is seeking USD180m from the Swiss firm, Lombard Odier & Cie categorically refuses the demand.In a statement dated 7 June, the private bank states that “the sums sought by the trustee concern redemptions which are said to have been received by Lombard Odier & Cie as depository bank on behalf of clients who sold shares in Madoff feeder funds, including Fairfield Sentry, Fairfield Sigma and Kingate Global.Lombard Odier & Cie did not recommend any funds managed by the Bernard Madoff investment company, nor feeder funds which supplied these, as part of its investment policy,” the firm adds. “Investments in funds exposed to Madoff were made at the initiative of clients concerned, or of managers external to Lombard Odier & Cie. In this context, the role of the bank is limited to that of depository in charge for client assets.Lombard Odier & Cie states that it will use all legal means at its disposal to oppose Picard’s demand.
