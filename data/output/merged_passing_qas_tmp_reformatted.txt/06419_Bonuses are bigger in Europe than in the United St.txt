Bonuses are bigger in Europe than in the United States


A Russell Reynolds’ annual survey suggests compensation for asset managers in Europe could go up by 20 per cent, compared with a 10 to 15 per cent rise in the US, according to the Financial Times Fund Management. “European based asset managers tend to have more asset classes that are doing well, so levels of optimism about bonus pools are higher,” said Amanda Foster, managing director of Russell Reynolds’ practice in London.
