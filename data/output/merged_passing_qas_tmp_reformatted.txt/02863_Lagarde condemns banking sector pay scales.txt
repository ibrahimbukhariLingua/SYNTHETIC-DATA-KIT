Lagarde condemns banking sector pay scales


In an interview with the Financial Times, Christine Lagarde has issued an “cri de coeur” against a return to the old practices at banks in pay and bonuses, and calls on G20 governments to place restrictions on methods of remuneration at banks that encourage excessive risk-taking. “I think it is an absolute disgrace that guaranteed bonuses of several years could still be paid, or that some people are thinking of reinstating the old ways of compensating with insufficient relationship between compensation and lasting performance and risk management,” says the French finance minister.
