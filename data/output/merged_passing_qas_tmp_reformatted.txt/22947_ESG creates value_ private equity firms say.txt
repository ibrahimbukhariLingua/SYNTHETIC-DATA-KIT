ESG creates value, private equity firms say


94% of private equity firms surveyed by PwC claim that environmental, social and governance (ESG) activities may create investment value. PwC surveyed 17 private equity firms about measures taken by the private equity sector in socially responsible investment, Among these firms, six rank among the world’s top 10, while 11 are among the world’s 50 largest private equity firms. Several respondents even cited cost savings and additional revenues due to new socially responsible products, in addition to improved reputation. Doughty Hanson claims that it has made EUR21m in additional revenue due to its socially responsible investment programme.88% of firms claim that socially responsible investment should attract higher levels of interest in the next five years.But despite this enthusiasm, half of private equity firms surveyed currently have no ESG or socially responsible investment policy. Only 40% of them have set up systems to create value through ESG activities, and 47% do not publicly report on their ESG programmes.
