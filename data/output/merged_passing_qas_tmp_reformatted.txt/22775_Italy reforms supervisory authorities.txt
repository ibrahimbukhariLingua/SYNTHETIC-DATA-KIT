Italy reforms supervisory authorities


The Italian insurance regulator (ISVAP) and the pension fund surveillance authority (COVIP) may disappear, Il Sole â€“ 24 Ore reports. The idea is to transfer the competences of the two authorities to the Bank of Italy, which would become the single regulatory authority for operator stability (banks, insurance and the finance sector). Consob (the market watchdog) and the antitrust agency would also see their resources related to transparency and market competition strengthened.
