Alternative strategies stable in August


Alternative strategies made a small gain (+0.02%) in August, clearly outperforming the S&P index, according to the Edhec Institute. Similar to its situation in June, and despite the losses of convertible bonds and a shrinking credit spread (-0.85%), the Convertible Arbitrage strategy took advantage of the plummeting stock market to manage a positive return (+1.25%) for a third consecutive month. Despite the losses on the commodities market but along with regular bonds, the CTA Global strategy managed a significant gain (+3.04%), its best since last November.The poor performances of the stock market naturally impacted the equity-oriented strategies. After some comfortable gains in July, the Equity Market Neutral (-0.57%), Event-Driven (-0.29%) and Long/Short Equity (-0.96%) strategies all inevitably lost ground.Curiously enough, despite its reduced exposure to the stock market, the Equity Market Neutral strategy was not the best performing among them. Conversely, the Fixed-Income Arbitrage strategy managed a significant profit (+0.99%)
