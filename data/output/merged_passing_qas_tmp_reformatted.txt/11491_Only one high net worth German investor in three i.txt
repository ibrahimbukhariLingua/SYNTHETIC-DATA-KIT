Only one high net worth German investor in three invests sustainably


Paradoxically, only one out of three high net worth investors in Germany already practices sustainable investment, respecting environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, even though three out of four are already considering sustainable development in the areas of electricity and heating, and 72% buy bio products. These are the findings of a survey published by Commerzbank.78% of respondents “would consider” investing “sustainably,” but the majority of respondents are only inclined to do so if the returns are at least equal to those of “normal” investments. 38% are prepared to accept a lower profit margin.Gustav Holtkemper, one of the heads of the wealth management unit at Commerzbank, says Germany lags far behind in the area of sustainable investment. In France, assets in financial assets with irreproachable economic, social and governance credentials total about USD2trn. In the United Kingdom, sustainable investments have about half this much, while in Germany they amount to less than USD100bn.
