East Capital launches a new sustainable development fund for emerging markets


The Swedish asset management firm East Capital, a specialist in emerging and frontier markets, has announced the launch of the East Capital Sustainable Emerging Markets fund this Friday, 30 June, to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the company. The new UCITS vehicle, domiciled in Luxembourg, will be managed by Peter Elam Hakansson, chairman and chief investment officer at East Capital, with the assistance of managers Adrian Pop and Fran√ßois Perrin in Hong Kong, and Louis Hedberg, head of corporate governance and sustainable development. The benchmark index is the MSCI Emerging Market Index. It will be launched with seed capital from several Scandinavian institutional investors. The fund will be made available to institutional and retail investors in most European countries. The new fund will invest in companies with high potential for growth and solid ESG (environment, social and governance) profiles, while overweighting themes related to domestic growth and emerging market consumer spending. This strategy will also seek investment opportunities in the areas of renewable energy and green technologies.
