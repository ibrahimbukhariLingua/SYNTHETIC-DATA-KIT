Competition intensifies in bond ETFs


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Since the financial crisis has driven investors from the equity markets, assets in bond ETFs have exploded: they now total over USD130bn, compared with USD20.5bn at the end of 2006, according to statistics from Morningstar, reported by the Wall Street Journal. In this segment, iShares continues to dominate, with a market share of 70%, but the competition is intensifying, with the arrival of products from State Street and Vanguard, among others, often with lower fees. Among the new actors, there are also PowerShares (Invesco) and Pimco, the latter of which has an actively-managed bond ETF which has already attracted USD349m. In total, more than 30 bond ETFs are available, but iShares (BlackRock) is the provider which offers the most complete range by far, a spokesperson for the firm points out.
