World - Provisional increase of 1.29% for Credit Suisse/Tremont index in April


According to estimates based on 55% of the usual sample, the Credit Suisse/Tremont hedge fund index is expected to post an increase in April of 1.29%. Although a number of long/short equity managers have increased their long positions in an effort to capture potential gains in market rallies, many other managers have maintained their exposures to beta at relatively low levels, and have remained relatively defensively positioned, which has led to returns below those of equity indexes.
