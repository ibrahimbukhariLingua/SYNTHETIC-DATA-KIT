Emerging markets have a growing importance in IPO market


Cross-border IPOs represented 9% (1,172) of the total number of operations, and 13% (USD220bn) of the total amount raised worldwide between 2002 and 2011, according to a study recently published by PwC and Baker McKenzie, entitled “Equity sans frontières: Trends in cross-border IPOs.” The past ten years have been marked by an increase in the number of Asian businesses undertaking cross-border IPOs. Businesses in Asia-Pacific make the most cross-border IPOs. China ranks first, with 347 cross-border operations, of which 39% were in the United States. Singapore is a major regional centre for cross-border IPOs, with most issuers from continental China (71% of operations hosted in Singapore, 130 issuers, raising USD5bn), or Hong Kong (14%, 26 issuers, USD6bn raised). Although Paris places in the top 10, London is the main destination for cross-border IPOs (480 cross-border issuers from markets worldwide held IPOs there, totalling USD110bn raised). These figures represent 34% of the volume, and 15% of the value of IPOs on the London Stock Exchange, and 38% in volume and 50% in value of cross-border operations worldwide. New York is the second destination for foreign issuers, with 264 IPOs totalling USD56bn raised. More than half of foreign firms which held IPOs in the United States (51%, 134 issuers) were from China, totalling USD20bn raised. Several of these operations were backdoor listings (acquisition of a public company by a private company).
