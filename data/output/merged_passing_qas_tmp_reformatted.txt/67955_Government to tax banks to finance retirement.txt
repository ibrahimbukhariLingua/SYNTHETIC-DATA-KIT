Government to tax banks to finance retirement


The head of the new Spanish socialist government of Pedro Sanchez has announced the creation of a new tax on banks which aims specifically to finance retirement, as social security is suffering from a severe deficit in Spain, AFP reports. “We are imposing a tax on the financial sector with the aim of supplementing social security contributions, and supporting the public pensions system and the dignity of our elderly persons,” he has announced to members of parliament.Sanchez came to power on 1 June, following a vote which punished his predecessor, the conservative Mariano Rajoy, largely with the support of the radical leftist Podemos party. He did not provide any details about the concrete terms of the future tax. In late 2017, social security debt, largely due to pension payments, totalled nearly EUR27.4bn. Demographic changes have resulted in an increase in pensions as a proportion of the state budget, from 21.6% to 29% of total spending, over 10 years.
