Rothschild &amp; Cie Gestion acquires private management activity from Somangest


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Rothschild & Cie Gestion, whose assets under management total about EUR24bn, on 3 July announced the acquisition of the French private management activities of Somangest, representing about EUR200m in assets. Somangest, an entrepreneurial asset management firm founded in 1991, was one of the pioneers of independent private asset management in France. The operation allows the private bank at Rothschild & Cie Gestion to extend its client base and to add to its teams. Patrice Pailloux, chairman and CEO of Somangest, welcomes the operation, “which makes it possible to offer our clients continuity in the quality of the management of their wealth, while giving them access to additional ranges developed by Rothschild & Cie Gestion, relying on recognized experts in the structuring of wealth and family office services, for example.” Alain Massiera, managing partner and head of private banking at Rothschild & Cie Gestion, claims that “this operation falls fully within the mid- to long-term strategy of the group, whose desire is to reinforce its activity in private management. In the past few years, we have consolidated our management range and optimized our organization: we have now decided to reasonably increase our sales staff, which perfectly illustrates this operation.”
