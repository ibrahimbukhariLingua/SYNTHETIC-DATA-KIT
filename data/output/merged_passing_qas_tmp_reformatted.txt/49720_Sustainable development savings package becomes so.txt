Sustainable development savings package becomes solidaristic

It will be available from all banking networks from 2017. At the bicentennial of the Caisse des Dépôts on 12 January this year, François Hollande announced a desire to strengthen financing of the social and solidaristic economy with the inflection of the LDD packet for the sector. “We have won a victory with the transformation of a regulatory investment package into a solidaristic package. This represents valuable support from the government and parliament, for solidaristic finance: it will allow 25 million French citizens who hold an LDD to give their savings a solidaristic orientation, which heeds the growing demand by savings investors to place their money in this direction! … All of our attention will now be focused on the implementation of this advance, which we hope to put in effect by the very beginning of 2017,” says Frédéric Tiberghien, chairman of the Finansol association. The current LDD has about EUR100bn in assets.
