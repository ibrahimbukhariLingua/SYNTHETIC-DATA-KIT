Global X launches an ETF using hedge fund ideas


The New York-based ETF management firm Global X Funds (USD1.3bn) has announced the launch of the Global X Top Guru Holdings Index ETF (acronym: GURU), which allows investors to benefit from the combined expertise of several major hedge fund managers.For this new product, Global X uses a proprietary methodology to extract the strongest convictions from several hedge fund managers with over USD100m in assets, who are required by regulations to release quarterly reports about the composition of their portfolios (13F form), eliminating funds with a high turnover range and portfolios which are not concentrated. The GURU fund is designed to be rebalanced every quarter, in order to capture major changes in these positions.The fund charges fees of 0.75%.
