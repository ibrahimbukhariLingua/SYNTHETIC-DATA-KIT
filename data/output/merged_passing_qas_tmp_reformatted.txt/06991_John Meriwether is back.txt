John Meriwether is back


The founder of LTCM (Long Term Capital Management), John Meriwether, has returned to the market.Meriwether, the cause of the most catastrophic bankruptcy in the history of alternative management, is said to be on the verge to launch a global macro strategy aimed at US and offshore investors, Financial News reports. This is Meriwetherâ€™s third attempt, as two previous projects, LTCM and JWM Partners, were not particularly successful. This may be the reason that he has abandoned relative value arbitrage strategy in favour of a more traditional strategy.
