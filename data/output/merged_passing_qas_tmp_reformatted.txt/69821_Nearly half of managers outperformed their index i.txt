For 2017 overall, 44% of active funds in Europeoutperformed their benchmark indices, compared with only 28% in 2016,according to the fifth edition of the annual study by Lyxor AssetMangement, “Analysing Active & Passive Fund Performance: What2017 Results Tell Us About Portfolio Construction.” The studycovers over 6,000 active funds domiciled in Europe, and compares themwith benchmark indices in 23 different universes, representing atotal of EUR1,4trn in assets under management.Equitymanagers have performed best, with 47% outperforming benchmarkindices, compared with 26% last year. “The active equity fundswhich outperformed are the ones which overweighted quality and/orgrowth factors, to the detriment of the ‘value’ factor, whichsupported performance in 2016, reflecting greater visibility andbetter liquidity on markets,” Lyxor states. For their part, despitebetter performance in 2017, only 39% of active bond managers haveoutperformed their benchmarks, compared with 32% the previous year.Inthe equity universe, the best results have been achieved in marketswhich are less efficient or more specific, such as Italy or Germany,and in European small caps. Meanwhile, the worst results are forlarge caps in the United States, the United Kingdom and China.Forbonds, active managers who prefer liquid and diversified markets suchas global bonds, US investment grade bonds and high yield corporatebonds, which generated the best returns, have done best. Meanwhile,the worst performance comes from the tightest segments in the bondmarkets, such as high yield bonds in euros and inflation-linkedsecurities in euros.
