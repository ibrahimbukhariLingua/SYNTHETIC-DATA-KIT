She ranks evenly with two managers based in New York, Scott Ferguson at Sachem Head Capital Management and Mark Kingdon at Kingdon Capital Management. The BlueTrend fund from Systematica has gained 6.4% this year (as of 8 April), more than double its performance last year (+3.4%). Braga has made USD10.2bn in assets for Systematica as of 1 March. She has more money under management than any other woman in the hedge fund industry, according to Business Insider UK.
