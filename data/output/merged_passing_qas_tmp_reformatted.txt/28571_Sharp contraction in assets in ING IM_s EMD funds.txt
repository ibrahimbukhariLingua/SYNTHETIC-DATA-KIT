Sharp contraction in assets in ING IMâ€™s EMD funds


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } In first half, assets under management by emerging market debt funds from ING IM fell from EUR13bn to EUR5.5bn, and US institutionals were the first to pull out, Istvan Fritsche, client portfolio manager, tells Fondsnieuws.Not all funds have been affected in the same manner by the phenomenon, which is partly due to the departure of 19 managers out of 35 (who joined Neuberger Berman): ING Patrimonial EMD Opportunities and ING Renta EM Corporate Debt Fund were virtually unaffected, but the two largest funds, ING Renta Fd EM Debt Hard Currency and ING Renta Fd EM Debt Local Currency, saw outflows of about 40%.
