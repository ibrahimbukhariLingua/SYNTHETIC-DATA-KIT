Warren Buffett admits mistake


At a general shareholders’ meeting for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett called the recent actions of his former aide David Sokol, who is accused of buying shares in Lubrizol at a time when he was conducting talks over a potential acquisition of the company “inexplicable and inexcusable,” the Wall Street Journal reports. The Berkshire Hathaway chairman also admitted that he shared some responsibility. “I obviously made a big mistake by not asking: ‘when did you buy those shares?'”
