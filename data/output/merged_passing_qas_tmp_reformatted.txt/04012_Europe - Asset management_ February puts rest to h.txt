Europe - Asset management: February puts rest to hopes of rapid rebound


In February, as equities markets suffered, European funds saw net redemptions of EUR1.7bn, according to the most recent statistics from Lipper FMI. The sector shows a negative balance for the month after three consecutive months of inflows, and has dashed fragile hopes of a rapid rebound. Assets now total EUR2.634trn, a decline of EUR93bn in one month.Lipper FMI sees a net preference for ?refuge? investments, with a marked interest in money market and commodities funds.Equities funds are in the red, however, but Lipper FMI points out that the scale of net redemptions (-EUR2.8bn) is modest compared with what was observed in 2008 during the difficult months on the market. Lipper FMI observes that ?investors seem to have concluded that the low point of the market is near, but they lack the confidence to take risks of all kinds yet.?Government bond funds had a negative impact on the bond category as a whole, but Lipper FMI sees a market interest in investment grade corporate bonds.In February, the management firm which stands out in particular is the British management firm M&G, which posted the strongest net subscriptions in the global and equities categories.
