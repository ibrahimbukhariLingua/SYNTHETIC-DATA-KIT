M&amp;G confirms moves in Luxembourg to prepare for post-Brexit


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } M&G is preparing for the post-Brexit era. The British asset management firm on 3 March confirmed its plans to launch a new range of Luxembourg-registered Sicavs by March 2019. It had announced these plans previously in October 2016. The new product range will include funds which will aim to adopt investment strategies similar to those of existing British-regsitered M&G funds, which are open to European investors. M&G is also creating a new legal entity in Luxembourg, consisting of two bodies: an asset management firm licensed under the UCITS directive and the Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM) directive, and another company dedicated to distribution of funds and services from the Luxembourg-registered asset management firm. “With the launch of this range of SICAVs, our international clients will be able to choose the most suitable way for them to access our fund strategies and their managers,” says Anne Richards, CEO of M&G Investments. “It also allows us to ensure that our European clients can continue to benefit from our management expertise after March 2019, independently of the form which commercial relationships between the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union take.”
