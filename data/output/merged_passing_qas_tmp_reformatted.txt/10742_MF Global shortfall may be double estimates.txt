MF Global shortfall may be double estimates


According to a spokesperson for the cxourt-appointed trustee James W. Giddens, the financial hole in the accounts of clients of the broker MF Global Holdings Ltd may measure more than USD1.2bn, twice as much as previously estimated. MF Global bonds fell by 19% on the news on Monday.Since MF Global entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the trustee has distributed USD1.5bn in collateral to clients, and will distribute USD520m in cash, following a legal decision last week. The office of the trustee says that there is still about USD1.6bn to distribute, but that there will not be much left after 60% of client accounts are reimbursed.
