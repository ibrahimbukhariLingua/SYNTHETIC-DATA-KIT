London looks to attract ETFs


The Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, on 5 December announced his decision to cancel a 0.5% stamp duty on ETFs from April 2014. The Chancellor had previously cancelled the stamp duty on equities listed on the AIM market. “Today, we are taking further measures to make our tax regime more competitive. The announcement that stamp duty on shares listed on the AIM would be cancelled was welcomed throughout the world. Today, we are also cancelling the stamp duty on shares purchased in ETFs, in order to encourage these funds to domicile themselves in the United Kingdom,” Osborne says. A large majority of ETFs escape stamp duty as they are domiciled outside the United Kingdom.
