German management firms gain ground on Luxembourg firms


In the past, Luxembourg funds on sale in Germany attracted considerably more in net subscriptions than German funds registered locally. This trend has now been reversed, as this year, open-ended funds registered in Germany attracted more than EUR7.81bn in the first nine months of the year, while Luxembourg funds underwent net outflows of EUR12.93bn, Kommalpha reports in the November edition of “Fondsmarkt.” Among the five management firms which attracted the strongest net subscriptions in the first three quarters of this year, the top two were Luxembourg-registered funds, db x-trackers (Deutsche Bank), with EUR3.75bn, and Pimco Europe (Allianz Global Investors), with EUR3.56bn. The other three were Union Investment Real Estate (EUR2.18bn), Union Investment Privatfonds (EUR2.04bn), and Universal-Investment (EUR1.52bn). However, four of the five largest outflows were from Luxembourg management firms: Deka SA (EUR4.75bn), Union Investment Luxembourg (EUR2.83bn), Allianz GI Luxembourg (EUR2.42bn), and cominvest SA (AGI, EUR2.17bn).
