SEC calls off money market fund reforms for the short term


The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 22 August announced that it is calling off plans to introduce rules to increase the security of money market funds, due to a failure to reach agreement internally over the question. “Three Commissioners, constituting a majority of the Commission, have informed me that they will not support a staff proposal to reform the structure of money market funds,” the chairman of the SEC, Mary Shapiro, says in a statement. The proposed measures, which had met with strong resistance from the profession, were intended to make funds more resistant to panic phenomena similar to those which occurred in 2008 during the financial crisis, which led to massive withdrawals of liquidity. While admitting her failure, the SEC chairman insists on the need not to give up on planned money market reforms. “The issue is too important to investors, to our economy and to taxpayers to put our head in the sand and wish it away,” Shapiro says, calling on legislators to this into account in deciding what steps should be taken to address this issue.
