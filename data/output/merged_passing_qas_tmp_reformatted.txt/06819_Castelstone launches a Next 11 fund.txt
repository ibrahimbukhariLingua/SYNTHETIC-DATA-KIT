Castelstone launches a Next 11 fund


Castlestone Management has launched its Next 11 emerging markets equity fund, which will invest in companies from 11 countries – South Korea, Mexico, Turkey, Indonesia, Vietnam, The Philippines, Egypt, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Iran – with high potential for BRIC-like growth at a lower price. The fund will be run by Arrash Zafari, Castlestone’s emerging markets specialist and portfolio manager. Zafari will be supported by a growing in-house analyst team as well as Castlestone’s investment committee based in London and the British Virgin Islands. The long-only fund is actively managed and aims to hold 30-35 positions, primarily through direct investment in equities; the fund may also make use of synthetic exposure, ETFs and third-party funds. Equities will be selected through a fundamental-driven, bottom-up approach, with emphasis on companies with attractive valuations and strong corporate governance. The fund will offer weekly liquidity. In normal periods, over half of the fund’s holdings will be concentrated in markets, namely Turkey, Mexico, South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines, that provide greater liquidity and higher levels of corporate governance and transparency. Minimum investment is USD/GBP/EUR10,000.
