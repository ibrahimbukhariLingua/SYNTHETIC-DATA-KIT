Gemway Assets starts up new fund with EUR29m


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } As announced by NewsManagers on 13 December, GemWay Assets, a French asset management firm specialised in emerging markets, has launched its second investment fund, GemAsia, with Meeschaert Asset Management, the asset management company of the Meeschaert group, as its partner. The directors held a press conference to explain how they met. “We had a manager on the Asian markets who retired, and we were looking for a specialist to contract out management of this region to,” explains Philippe Troesch, responsible for asset management activities at the group. “We met Meeschaert for the first time this summer. Things went very fast,” adds Michel Audeban, CEO of Gemway. “The found was created last week. GemAsia is for now a part of GemEquity, which itself is 70% invested in Asia. It has been seeded with EUR29m from Meeschaert.” This sum represents the start of the first Gemway fund in five years, says Bruno Vanier, chairman of Gemway Assets and manager of GemAsia and GemEquity, while the GemEquity fund now has EUR500m. The advantage of this association will be for Gemway Assets to increase the proportion of private investors in its fund. Clients of Meeschaert benefit from a dedicated M share class via a feeder fund called MAM Asia. “We have lowered our margins in such a way that clients can pay the same thing via our fund or by going straight to the Gemway fund,” explains Sébastien Korchia, CEO of Meeschaert Asset Management and head of equity management. All clients at Meeschaert who had had a direction position on Asian companies have agreed to follow Meeschaert’s lead and enter the Gemway fund after the sale of their direct positions. “We had a very precise schedule set up with the AMF for sale of direct stakes and the creation of the MAM and GemAsia funds,” says Korchia. The MAM fund is 100% invested in GemAsia. GemAsia may, however, accept its own clients. The fund charges 1.05% for I shares, and 2.10% for R shares. It carries outperformance commissions, but no commissions on movements.
