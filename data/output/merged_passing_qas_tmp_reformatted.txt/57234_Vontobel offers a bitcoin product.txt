Vontobel offers a bitcoin product


The Swiss private bank Vontobel, which last year launched a “tracker certificate” for bitcoin, on 17 November announced the launch of a new product, a fugures contract, the Short Mini-Future, for virtual currency. With this new vehicle, investors will be able to speculate on the decline of the very volatile crypto-currency. It is already possible to short bitcoin, for example with contracts for difference. But CFD are expensive and even more risky than mini-futures.“With this new offer, Vontobel again demonstrates its capacity for innovation as a top provider in the structured products sector,” says Roger Studer, head of the investment bank at Votobel. The Vontobel Financial Products division has a market share of 25% in the Swiss structured products market.
