Kyle Bass returns to subprime


The hedge fund manager Kyle Bass, who made gains of about USD500m by short-selling subprime mortgages during the crash in 2007, has announced that he will now be betting half of his money on a rebound of those assets, the news agency Bloomberg reports. Hayman Capital Management, the alternative management firm led by Bass, has invested more than half of his money in sub-prime bonds. Firms which concentrate their assets have earned 19% returns since the beginning of the year, compared with an average of 1.1% for the hedge fund sector overall, according to Bloomberg estimates. Assets under management at Hayman as of the end of September totalled USD1bn, according to a presentation by the firm, obtained by Bloomberg.
