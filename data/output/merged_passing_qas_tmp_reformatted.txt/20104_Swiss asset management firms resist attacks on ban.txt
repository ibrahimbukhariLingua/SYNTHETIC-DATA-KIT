Swiss asset management firms resist attacks on banking confidentiality


Repeated assaults on Swiss banking confidentiality do not appear to be discouraging investors who have previously trusted Swiss managers, Investment Europe reports. According to statistics disclosed by the US firm SNL Financial, Credit Suisse has even reversed the trend of eroding assets under management, with a 2.4% increase in first half, to CHF1.210trn, which was facilitated by a 2.11% increase in the value of assets. Bank Corp has also posted an increase in its assets under management of 4.17% in first half 2012, largely aided by market effects. EFG International, however, did not reverse the trend, but still had a limited downward movement in assets under management of 2.62%, compared with more than 8% last year.
