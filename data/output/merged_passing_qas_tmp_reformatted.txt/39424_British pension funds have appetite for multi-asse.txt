British pension funds have appetite for multi-asset strategies


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Multi-asset class strategies have the full favour of British pension funds. According to a survey of 64 public or private pension fund managers by Baring Asset Management, 83% of respondents are now exposed to mutli-asset class investment strategy. This figure represents a very strong increase compared with the previous surveys: only 70% said so six months ago, and 65% had such an exposure one year ago. Meanwhile, the study finds an increasing preoccupation on the part of pension funds for the themes of volatility and risk. Among managers who recently modified the asset allocations for their funds, 60% did so to reduce volatility, while 40% of them modified their asset allocation in order to better make their assets correspond to their liabilities. However, 33% of managers made these changes to get better returns from their funds.
