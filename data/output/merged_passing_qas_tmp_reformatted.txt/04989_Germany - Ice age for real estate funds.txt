Germany - Ice age for real estate funds


Of the twelve real estate funds which froze redemptions at the end of October, only the DEGI International and the Focus Nordic Cities are opening their windows back up this season. The other products, representing total assets of EUR30bn, or one third of the total market, remain frozen, the BÃ¶rsen-Zeitung reports. Management firms claim they are planning to reopen their funds as soon as possible. But it is also possible that some of them will extend the redemption freeze for another year, until October 2010.
