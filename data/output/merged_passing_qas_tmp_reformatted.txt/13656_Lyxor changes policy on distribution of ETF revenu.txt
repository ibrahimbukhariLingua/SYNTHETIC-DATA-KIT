Lyxor changes policy on distribution of ETF revenues


Lyxor announced on Tuesday, 21 June that it has adopted a new policy for distribution of revenues from ETFs, following changes to the majority of the equities indices which serve as benchmarks for its ETFs. The funds will now no longer be “Price Return,” meaning that the value of the index does not include reinvestment of dividends distributed to shareholders in businesses belonging to the index, but rather “Total Return,” meaning that the value of the index will now include reinvestment of dividends.As a result, for distribution of revenues from ETFs themselves, the manager or the delegated financial manager for the ETFs may undertake a distribution once or twice per year for asset classes which earn dividends, of a total amount equivalent to the dividends earned as points for the index, a statement says.
