Pension funds attentive to ESG criteria


Trustees of three quarters of British pension funds interviewed by UKSIF estimate that ESG (environmental, social and governance) criteria may have a material impact on their funds’ investments in the long term. Two thirds of trustees feel that it is important to align the fund’s sustainable investment policies with the sustainable development strategy of the firm that established the fund. UKSIF, the British sustainable finance association, surveyed pension funds from companies on the cutting edge in corporate responsibility. The initiative was sponsored by Hermes Fund Mangers and KBC Asset Management.
