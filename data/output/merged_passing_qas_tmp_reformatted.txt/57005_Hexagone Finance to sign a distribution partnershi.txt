Hexagone Finance to sign a distribution partnership for infrastructure debt


Hexagone Finance, a fund and financial product selection company for institutional investors, has signed a distribution partnership with the British firm Sequoia, an asset management firm specialised in infrastructure debt, NewsManagers has learnt. Since its inception in 2013, Hexagone has formed 50 partnerships, either as a broker (for futures accounts, capitalisation contracts, etc.), or as a third party marketer for investment funds. In the latter role, Hexagone Finance has become the exclusive distributor in France for the Swiss Vontobel Asset Management and its affilate Twenty Four AM for more restricted expertise. Hexagone Finance has also worked for Hugau Gestion and the retail microlending company Prêt d’Union. “We have 132 clients and have intermediated EUR2bn” says one of the four partners at the firm, Isabelle Renault. The firm created an affiliate entitled Hexagone Conseil in September 2016, to advise institutional investors on larger issues than the mere choice of products, such as asset allocation advising, recommendations for investments or asset management firms as part of dedicated mandates, investment monitoring, presentation to boards of directors, training, etc. Six investors have already placed confidence in them.
