DWS builds a multi-asset class unit


On 23 September, DWS (Deutsche Bank) announced the creation of a team of 24 qualified professionals dedicated to multi-asset class management. The unit will start up with assets of about EUR7bn. The segment has already attracted over EUR10bn in investments in Germany since the beginning of the year, and DWS expects average growth in the mid-term of about 8% p.a. in this area.The team is led by Christian Hille and Udo Rosendahl. The unit includes four teams specialised in equities, bonds, currencies, volatility and commodities, which share a common investment process based on DWS projections for asset classes, regions and markets. In the fund management framework, the new group will have as much power as the equities and bond teams.
