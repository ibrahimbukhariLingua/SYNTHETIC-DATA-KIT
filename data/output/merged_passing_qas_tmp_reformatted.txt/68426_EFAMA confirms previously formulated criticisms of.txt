EFAMA confirms previously formulated criticisms of PRIIPs


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } EFAMA is doubling down. The European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA) on 28 June published an evidence paper, which discusses the faults in the new Packaged Retail Investment and Insurance-Based Products (PRIIP) framework which aims to make pre-contractual information related to packaged financial products uniform, which came into effect six months ago. The evidence presented by the professional association, which includes performance and cost, reveals that the key information document (KID) within PRIIP tends to confuse investors, or at worst lead them to make errors, although the document is meant to help the investor to better understand financial products. The document emphasizes that the new method for calculating transaction costs will also result in figures that tend to cause confusion and which are not reliable. In addition to this incorrect methodology, the paper expresses regret again that past performance can no longer be shown, and that future performance projections based on a market moving in only one direction for an indefinite period are far too optimistic and linear. Consequently, EFAMA calls on the relevant authorities and the European Commission to take action as soon as possible to revise PRIIP, without taking into account the scheduled examination of the rules, in order to put an end to “systematic misinformation” of investors, and to prevent further disagreements with European consumers. “We are also extremely concerned by the fact that the current legal framework will require funds to produce a PRIIP KID and a UCITS KIID (Key Investor Information Document) simultaneously, by December 2019. In light of the proven negative impact of PRIIP KID rules on investors, we strongly recommend that the exemption for funds which produce a UCITS KIID be extended until these problems be resolved satisfactorily in the next examination of PRIIP,” says Peter de Proft, director general of EFAMA, in a statement. It should also be noted that de Proft is to speak on Friday, 29 June in Brussels, at a public hearing by the European Commission on the Capital Markets Union (CMU) and retail investors.
