ORSE publishes a guide to integration of the social and environmental responsibility into operational risk control frameworks


The Study Center for Corporate Social Responsibility (ORSE) has published a practical guide laying out the interactions between operational risks in the Basel II referential and environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks under ISO 26000 standards, and their embodiment in the form of indicators, by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the European federation of financial analyst associations (EFFAS). Daniel Lebègue, chairman of ORSE, says “this guide enriches in two ways. Firstly, it adds to referentials for direction of risks, by throwing additional light via the prisim of ESG. It also provides an addition to the extra-financial analysis approach, and extra-financial ratings agencies which do not systematically cover questions related to operational risks.”
