Candriam granted AIFM license for management centres in France and Luxembourg


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } The European multi-specialist asset management fimr Candriam on 25 September announced that it has obtained an AIFM license for its asset management centres in France and Luxembourg. “Few asset management companies currently have the same double license as Candriam, both UCITS and AIFM,” the firm says in a statement. Candriam Luxembourg and Candriam France have complied with directive 2011/61/EU, which came into force on 22 July 2014, which requires all European asset management firms which manage at least one alternative investment fund (meaning a fund which does not comply with the UCITS directive), with assets above a certain threshold, to obtain an AIFM license. Candriam Belgium is awaiting the issuance of this license. Fabrice Cuchet, head of alternative management at Candriam, comments: “This is good news for our clients. We are one of the few asset management firms which has opted for a double license, AIFM and UCITS. This specificity, coupled with the auality of our products and teams, who have been managing regulated funds for 18 years, represents a major competitive advantage in continuing to offer investors investment solutions which meet their needs.” “The implementation of the combined structure (both UCITS and AIFM) sometimes known as ‘Super ManCo’ is a logical choice of direction for a large asset management firm. This status of ‘Super ManCo’ allows for alternative investment funds to be extended the same ManCo services which we already offer to UCITS funds,” Candriam states.
