UBS prepared to pay EUR200m to the German tax authorities


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The bank UBS is prepared to pay EUR180m to EUR200m to the German tax authorities to avoid charges over its role in tax evasion practiced by Germans, according to the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. The bank “is preparing” to have to pay a sum of this order, the newspaper reports on the basis of “financial sources.” It would be “the largest penalty ever paid by a bank in Germany for complicity in tax evasion,” Süddeutsche Zeitung reports. The exact amount is subject to tough negotiations between the German authorities and the bank, the newspaper states. The regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia in 2012 purchased a CD containing information on German tax evaders, some of whose money was placed at UBS in Switzerland. In total, about CHF20bn in untaxed assets may have been placed by Germans with UBS, according to the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
