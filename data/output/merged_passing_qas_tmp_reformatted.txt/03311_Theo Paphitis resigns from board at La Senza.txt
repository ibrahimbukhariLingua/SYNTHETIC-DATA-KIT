Theo Paphitis resigns from board at La Senza


According to reports in the Sunday Times, Theo Paphitis has resigned from the board of directors at the lingerie chain La Senza, due to differences of opinion about strategy with other directors, and particularly with the private equity investor Lion Capital, to whom he sold the company in 2006 for GBP100m. He returned to the helm at the firm following the ousting of Rose Foster, CEO, in February. Two months later, he entered negotiations with Lion Capital to buy back a majority stake in La Senza; it appears that these negotiations were unsuccessful.
