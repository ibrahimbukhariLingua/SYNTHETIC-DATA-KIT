Mapfre teams up with Carmignac to launch a new pension fund


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The asset management division of the Spanish insurer Mapfre on 29 November announced that it is launching a new pension fund entitled Mapfre Jubilación Activa, whose management will be outsourced to Carmignac. “This is the first time that a Spanish pension fund manager has teamed up with an independent and internationally-known asset management firm to launch a long-term savings product,” Mapfre comments in a statement. Another innovation resides in the very open approach to distribution of the product. The new pension fund will be available both on the Mapfre sales network and over financial platforms such as Inversis. The Mapfre Jubilación Activa fund comes as an addition to the existing range managed by Mapfre Asset Management, which currently has over EUR5bn in assets under management.
