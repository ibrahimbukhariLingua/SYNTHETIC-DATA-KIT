UBP adds to socially responsible investment product range


Union Bancaire Privée (UBP) yesterday announced the launch of the Positive Impact Equity strategy, focused on companies which have a positive social and environmental impact. The objective for UBP is to “responds to growing demand from clients for solutions which ally ethics with performance,” the Swiss private bank explains in a statement. The Positive Impact Equity strategy aims to generate higher returns over the long term by investing in companies which, via their products and/or solutions, contribute to address the major social and environmental challenges. “It thus follows a long-term approach, and has the unique quality of assigning as much weight to the measurement of non-financial performance of companies as it does to their financial performance,” UBP states. The portfolio is focused on global themes, and is composed of 25 to 35 companies which aim to respect measurable impact criteria. As a part of this, UBP has set up a measurement mechanism in collaboration with the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL) at Cambridge University. The new strategy will be managed jointly by Victoria Leggett and Rupert Welchman, managers on the equity team based in London. Leggett is also responsible for socially responsible investment for asset management at UBP. p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; }
