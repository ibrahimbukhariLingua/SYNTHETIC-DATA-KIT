Seven Capital launches an absolute return bond fund


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The French asset management firm Seven Capital Management is launching Seven Fixed Income Fund, an absolute return bond fund that complies with UCITS III. The new fund may invest in all bond markets worldwide, in the context of a volatility risk centred on about 4%. The quantitative management process is derived from that of the Global Technical Asset Allocation (GTAA) and Global Risk Asset Allocation (GRAA), developed by Seven Capital Management. “The Seven Fixed Income Fund uses allocation techniques to ensure the optimal balance of risks between bond markets, as well as long and short positions, in order to maximise returns on a portfolio with a clear and transparent investment universe; dynamic rebalancing of the portfolio as a function of the evolution of market risk components; use of investment supports in each bond market with maximal liquidity, using primarily futures markets; seeking the best opportunities from a global universe,” says the product’s presentation document. The fund has daily adjustment of the strategic allocation by risk budget, per market. The fund has a volatility objective of 4%, max draw down of 4%, and a Sharpe ratio objective of about 1. The fund will develop in an average sensitivity range of 0 to +10. However, depending on the evolution of the bond markets, it may range from -25 to +25.
