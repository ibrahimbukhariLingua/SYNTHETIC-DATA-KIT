S&amp;P concerned about size of an M&amp;G fund


The financial ratings agency Standard & Poor’s has expressed concerns about the size of the M&G optimal income fund, whose assets under management total GBP5.5bn, Money Marketing reports. In the past twelve months, the fund has doubled in size, topping GBP5bn in July. In normal periods, such a size is not a problem, but the manager of the fund, Richard Woolnough, has said that it is difficult to modify more than 10% of the fund at a time, despite the support of a large team and the use of derivatives. S&P has maintained the fund’s AAA rating, however, due to the excellent reputation of Woolnough and the bond team at M&G.
