KAS Bank plans to develop in the German market


JÃ¶rg Sittmann, CEO of KAS Investment Servicing and country manager at KAS Bank for Germany, says in an interview that the Netherlands-based group is aiming for both organic and external growth on the German market, even though its current size (EUR1.8bn in funds and EUR3.8bn in mandates) is enough to make it profitable. The manager estimates that acquisitions in fund administration from the Landesbanken or mid-sized insurers could be attractive for KAS Bank.
