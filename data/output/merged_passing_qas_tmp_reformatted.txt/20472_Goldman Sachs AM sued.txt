Goldman Sachs AM sued


A Netherlands pension fund, Vervoer, has filed a lawsuit in the United Kingdom against Goldman Sachs Asset Management, seeking EUR250m for negligence, according to reports in Financial News. The EUR11bn pension fund accuses the asset management firm of advising it to invest in sub-prime MBS in mid-2007, at a time when it already knew that the proprietary trading desk was short-selling the same MBS to make gains from their falling price.
