Legg Mason closes a fund dedicated to natural resources


In a letter to investors dated 7 July, Legg Mason announced a decision to liquidate the Legg Mason Martin Currie Global Ressources fund from 31 July 2017. The fund has already been closed to new subscriptions until its final liquidation. “All shares in the fund held as of the date of its liquidation will be redeemed on the basis of the net asset value (NAV) of each share class,” the asset management firm states. To explain the decision, Legg Mason explains that “the fund is small in terms of NAV and we do not expect it to increase significantly in the mid- to long term due to lack of demand for this strategy.” In this context, the fund is no longer economically viable, the asset management firm adds. As of the end of May 2017, the fund had USD11.4bn in assets under management.
