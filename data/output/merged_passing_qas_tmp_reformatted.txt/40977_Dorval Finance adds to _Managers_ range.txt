Dorval Finance adds to “Managers” range


On the strength of its expertise in wealth management with its “Managers” range of equity funds and its range of totally flexible funds, the independent asset management firm Dorval Finance on 7 January announced at a presentation of its 2014 investment strategy that it had decided to extend its “Managers” range with the launch of the Dorval Managers Small Cap Euro fund. The firm may put its experience of more than eight years in the selection of quality managers and small companies to use for the fund. Small companies have historically represented nearly half of equity allocations to the Dorval Managers fund and have largely contributed to its good performance. For the new fund, Dorval Finance has extended its investment spectrum to a small cap universe of 785 securities which are eligible for PEA, distributed over the entire euro zone, including 235 companies in Germany, 172 in France, 97 in Italy, representing more than two thirds of the investment universe, with total market capitalisation of between EUR50m and EUR7bn, in line with the managerial filter developed by the management team, and matching transversal or sectroal investment themes.
