Decarbonization of institutional portfolios progressing faster than projected


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The international organisation Portfolio Decarbonization Coalition (PDC), which assists in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions via engagement with institutional invetors to decarbonize their portfolios, has announced better-than-expected results. It now supervises the decarbonization of USD230bn in assets under management, though it had initially set a far more modest target of USD100bn. In another positive development, the chairman and CEO has announced new memberships, namely, Hermes Investment Management in the United Kingdom, MN Services in the Netherlands, BNP Paribas Investment Partners, Humanis and the Caisse des Dépôts (CDC) in France, bringing the number of participants in the organization to 23, with USD2.2trn in assets under management. New members are expected to join the organization at COP 21.
