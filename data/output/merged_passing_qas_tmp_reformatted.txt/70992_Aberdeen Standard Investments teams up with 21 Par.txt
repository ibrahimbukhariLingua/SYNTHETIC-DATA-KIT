The new entity, based in the United Kingdom, will launch a fund in the next few months with EUR1bn, dedicated to direct investment in private equity.

The investment vehicle will concentrate primarily on Europe, and will have a maximum lifespan of 15 years. The joint venture, based in London, will have an initial team of six people. Its board of directors will be led by Alessandro Benetton, founder and managing partner at 21 Partners.
