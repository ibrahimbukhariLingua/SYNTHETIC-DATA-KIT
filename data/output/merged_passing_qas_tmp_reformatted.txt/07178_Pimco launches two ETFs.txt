Pimco launches two ETFs


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } With the Pimco Build America Bond Strategy Fund (BABZ), an actively-managed ETF, and the Pimco Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index Fund (CORP), a passively-managed fund, Pimco (Allianz Global Investors group) has added two products to its range, one with a management commission of 0.45%, and the other with fees of 0.20%. BABZ offers access to the taxable municipal bond markets, and aims to capture the performance of the best securities, while avoiding issues from municipalities which Pimco considers to have deteriorating credit quality. The fund is managed by John Cummings, executive vice president and head of the municipal bond desk. COPR invests in investment grade corporate bonds, most of which belong to the BofA ML US Corporate index, with careful balancing of the duration curve and the credit characteristics of the index.
