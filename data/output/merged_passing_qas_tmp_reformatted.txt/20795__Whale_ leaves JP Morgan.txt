“Whale” leaves JP Morgan


The Wall Street Journal reports that Bruno Iksil, the “London Whale,” Achilles Macris and Javier Martin-Artajo are no longer part of the personnel of J.P. Morgan Chase in London, as of Thursday this week. The three employees of the Chief Investment Office, responsible for invesing the bank’s excess liquidity, made outrageous bets which cost the firm USD25bn in market value, and over USD5bn in losses in second quarter. They had already been barred from any trading activities when J.P. Morgan discovered the scale of the losses. Despite these losses, the group is expected to announce profits for the April-June quarter this Friday.
