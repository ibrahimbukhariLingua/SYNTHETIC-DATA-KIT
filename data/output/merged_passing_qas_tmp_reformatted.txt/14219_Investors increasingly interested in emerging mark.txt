Investors increasingly interested in emerging markets and alternative investments


Investors worldwide are acquiring a growing interest in emerging markets and alternative asset classes, according to an annual survey of institutional investors by Mercer (“2010 Global Manager Search Trends report”). From a diversification standpoint, investors are interested in real estate, largely due to the relatively attractive prices in this asset class. There is also a growing interest in commodities, infrastructure, and multi-strategy hedge funds. Research into emerging markets, both in equities and bonds, has also increased strongly. Andy Barber, global director of Manager Research at Mercer, says that “interest in non-traditional asset classes is continuing to increase, as investors seek to diversify their investments and participate in opportunities to generate alpha and beta.” Interest in traditional investments is falling, due to the crisis, but it will continue, Berber predicts, adding that mandates for traditional equities and bond management will continue to dominate research activities in the short term. In Europe, research activities have been significantly reduced in the United Kingdom in 2010, but had increased strongly the previous year, while it has risen more than 50% in Germany, with strong demand for emerging markets strategies (equities and bonds). Activities have also increased in Switzerland and Sweden, while they have fallen in France, Ireland, and the Netherlands.
