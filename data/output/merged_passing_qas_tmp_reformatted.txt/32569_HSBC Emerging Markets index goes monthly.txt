HSBC Emerging Markets index goes monthly


On the basis of the GDP of the 16 largest emerging markets (Saudi Arabia, Brazil, China, South Korea, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, Czech Republic, Russia, Taiwan, Turkey and Vietnam), the HSBC Emerging Markets index (HSBC EMI) will move to a monthly, rather than quarterly, frequency, HSBC has announced. In January, the index rose to 53.9, from 53 in December. “This is the highest level since February 2012, which is a sign of real acceleration in growth in emerging markets,” the firm has stated, adding that the growth is particularly strong in the manufacturing sector, and in China, where the EMI growth rate is the most dynamic it has been for 2 years.
