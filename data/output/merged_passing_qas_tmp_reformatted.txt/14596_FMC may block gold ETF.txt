FMC may block gold ETF


According to the Business Standard, relayed by Handelsblatt, the Indian Forward Markets Commission (FMC) is reportedly planning to ask all ETF issuers no longer to accept subscriptions to gold ETFs, and no longer to launch such products.The FMC, which is the regulatory authority for commodities, is concerned about the influence these funds have on the gold markets, although the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which supervises investment funds, has thus far not reacted to the demands of the FMC.
