Morgan Stanley P2 Value fund remains closed, while UBS (D) 3 Kontinente reopens


On Thursday, the German management firm Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investment GmbH announced that it will be extending the closure of its P2 Value real estate fund to redemptions for a maximum of 12 months, despite gross liquidity of 16% and credit lines made available to the fund. The manager states that as of 30 September the occupancy rate for properties in the portfolio totalled 93.3%, and that defaults on rent remained under 1%. As of 28 October, assets in the fund totalled slightly over EUR1.44bn. As of 13 July, the fund was also provisionally closed to subscriptions, due to an expected depreciation of the value of assets in the portfolio. On the other hand, UBS Real Estate KAG has announced that due to the positive evolution of liquidity and subscriptions, it has reopened the open-ended real estate fund UBS (D) 3 Kontinente (EUR472m as of 30 September) to redemptions from 27 October, at noon. However, the fund management company is introducing a 3% penalty for withdrawal, which will be paid back into the fund. Due to the change of strategy of the fund, it will now be known as UBS 3 Sector Real Estate Europe.
