Edouard Carmignac retires from management of Carmignac Patrimoine


In a letter to professionals and shareholders in the Carmignac Patrimoine fund, Edouard Carmignac, the famous founder of Carmignac Gestion, has announced that he has handed off 100% of the management of the flagship fund Carmignac Patrimoine to his colleagues Rose Ouahba, head of fixed income, and David Older, head of equity management. “I now have the pleasure of being able to grant my colleagues … all of the management of our Carmignac Patrimoine fund, relying on their teams and the strategic investment board, whose creation we announced last summer,” he writes. The founder of the firm, established 30 years ago, says that he hopes to refocus on providing his expertise within the small committee, whose role is to “produce clear market convictions, nourished by analysis by our teams, in all asset classes, and for all of our funds.” This represents a new stage in a transition which has been ongoing at the asset management firm since the appointment of David Older as manager of the Carmignac Investissement fund in September 2018. In his letter, Carmignac says that his company has assets under management of EUR40bn “today,” although at its peak recently, the firm had over EUR50bn. This is a veiled admission that 2018 was a difficult year for the firm.
