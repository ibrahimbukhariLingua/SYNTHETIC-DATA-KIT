AQR turns to products with lower fees


The alternative management firm AQR Capital Management, led by Clifford Asness, in January launched the mutual fund AQR Diversified Arbitrage Fund, whose TER will be limited to 1.75%. AQR, which has been hit by the crisis and poor returns for its products, is planning to launch a new range of mutual funds which will use momentum hedge fund strategies created by Asness when he was a graduate student in finance at the University of Chicago, the Wall Street Journal reports. The difference is largely that mutual funds will not charge a 20% commission on performance. AQR is not the only management firm to be moving towards products with slimmer margins: the fund of hedge fund manager Permal launched its first mutual fund in April.
