BlackRock applies for a license for two actively-managed ETF funds


In a 40-App form, BlackRock has applied to the SEC for permission to launch the iShares Active Fixed Income fund and the iShares Active Equity Fund, funds of ETFs which will be actively managed. The underlying ETFs will be at least 80% products advised by BlackRock Fund Advisors (BFA), which will also be the advisor to the new funds.
