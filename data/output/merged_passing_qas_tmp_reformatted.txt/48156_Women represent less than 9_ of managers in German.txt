Women represent less than 9% of managers in Germany


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Women managers are still a rarity in Germany. According to the German professional network Fondsfrauen, out of 1,021 licensed funds on the German market (source Morningstar), only 86, or 8.42%, are managed by women. This is less than in Austria, where the percentage is 10.12%. Fondsfrauen plans to actively contribute to making women account for at least 30% of fund managers by 2019. The professional network, which points out in its recent publication that the majority of young economics graduates are now women, regrets that they are comparatively absent from positions of responsibility. Among ways of increasing their presence, Fondsfrauen cites improving childcare solutions, which are comparatively undeveloped in Germany, and flexible working hours. The Fondsfrauen network was founded in 2014 by Anne Connelly, director of marketing for EMEA at Morningstar Europe, Anke Debmowski, editor of publications at Fonds Professionell and Institutional Money, and Manuela Fr√∂hlich, head of wholesale distribution at Aquila Capital Advisors. It is dedicated exclusively to women working in the fund industry.
