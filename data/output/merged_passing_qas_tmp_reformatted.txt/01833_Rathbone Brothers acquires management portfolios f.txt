Rathbone Brothers acquires management portfolios from Lloyds Banking Group


The British bank Lloyds Banking Group (LBG) announced on 20 October that it has sold asset management portfolios to Rathbone Brothers for a maximum of GBP35.4m, or EUR39m. In total, 6,000 LBG clients, with a total of GBP1.27bn in assets under management, will be transferred to Rathbone, pending their approval. After the transfer, LBG will continue to manage GBP8.5bn in assets for 35,000 high net worth clients. The bank, born of the merger of Lloyds TSB and HBOS, which has already laid off about 8,000 employees since the merger, has also signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Rathbone to send it clients with between GBP250,000 and GBP2m to invest. LBG expects about 40 layoffs to come in Edinburgh as a result of the transaction, though it is working to avoid as many layoffs as possible.
