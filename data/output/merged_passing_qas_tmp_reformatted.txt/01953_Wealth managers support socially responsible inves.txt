Wealth managers support socially responsible investment


Socially responsible investment is a growing presence on the wealth management scene. According to a survey by the socially responsible investment specialist Eiris, published in association with the specialised news service WealthBriefing and the private bank Kleinwort Benson, 90% of wealth managers resopnding to the survey say their socially responsible investment portfolios have earned returns similar to or better than their other portfolios. For their part, high net worth clients are increasingly aware of social, environmental and governance issues and the implications these have on their investments. This year, 55% of wealth managers will probably study the impact of governance issues and other regulatory topics on the portfolios of their clients. However, wealth managers are unhappy with a lack of clarity and information about performance, which, from their point of view, represents a significant barrier to the creation of dedicated solutions in socially responsible investment. As a result of the crisis, it is increasingly difficult for wealth managers to retain clients who have become increasingly unstable. According to the study, one of the ways to gain the loyalty of these clients may be precisely to respond to a growing number of requests from high net worth clients for SRI products.
