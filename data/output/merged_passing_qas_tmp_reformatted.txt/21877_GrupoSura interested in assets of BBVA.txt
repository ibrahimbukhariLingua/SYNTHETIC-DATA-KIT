GrupoSura interested in assets of BBVA


David Borjani, chairman of the Colombian GrupoSura, has said that he is examining the possibility of acquiring all or part of the Latin American assets which BBVA is putting up for sale, i.e. the pension fund administration units in Chile (EUR30.2bn), Mexico (EUR13.1bn), Colombia (EUR6.75bn) and Peru (EUR5.4bn), Funds People reports. Borjani would prefer to study these cases country be country rather than acquiring all of the assets.
