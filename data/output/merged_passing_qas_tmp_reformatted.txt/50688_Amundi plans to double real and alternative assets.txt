Amundi plans to double real and alternative assets by 2020


Amundi is making something new out of something old to create a new unit. The largest asset management firm in Europe on 27 September unveiled its new platform dedicated to real and alternative assets, which aims to become one of the largest European alternative asset management firms. Real estate, private debt, private equity and infrastructure are now part of an integrated unit. “With the support of expertise which already exists within the group, and on the other hand by forming innovative partnerships, Amundi already has a high level of legitimacy in its asset classes. It thus has exclusive access to a large number of real estate operations throughout Europe, and also actively participates in the financing of the real economy via private debt, private equity and infrastructure,” the firm says.With 200 employees in origination, structuring and management of these asset classes, the unit represents about EUR34bn in assets under management as of the end of June 2016.Real estate represents the largest area of expertise, with assets of EUR14bn, and has 100 dedicated employees. This expertise is concentrated largely on office and commercial properties, and is developing increasingly in Germany and Benelux. Private debt, which for some time has been quietly developing, already has EUR9bn, of which EUR6bn are in corporate and EUR3bn in aeronautic financing. Direct private equity, a niche dedicated currently to French growth SMBs, represents EUR1bn in assets under management, with 15 employees. The infrastructure unit, for its part, concentrates on the energy transition, with a new asset management firm, Amundi Transition Energétique (ATE), co-founded with EDF. Lastly, multi-management, an expert area developed since the 1990s has EUR10bn, and 60 employees.The objective for the group is to double assets under management in real and alternative assets by 2020, or in other words to reach EUR70bn in four years.
