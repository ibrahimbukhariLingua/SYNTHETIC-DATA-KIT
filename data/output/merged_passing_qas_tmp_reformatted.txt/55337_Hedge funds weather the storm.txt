Hedge funds weather the storm


The Lyxor hedge fund index lost 0.9% in January. Out of 11 Lyxor indices, five finished the month in positive territory. The Lyxor CTA Long Term (+2.2%), Lyxor Global Macro (+0.7%) and Lyxor Fixed Income Arbitrage (+0.7%) indices saw the best performances. Hedge funds also showed remarkable resistance in January. Reasonable growth forecasts at the beginning of the year were aggressively revised downward after the publication of disappointing Chinese PMI figures and the depreciation of CNY. Investors visibly integrated the likelihood of a hard landing in China, the growing powerlessness of the central banks, a risk of recession in the United States and a return to global deflation.In this context, CTA were boosted due to their short exposure to commodities and long exposure to bonds. The FI Arbitrage and Global Macro funds participated in relative and tactical money market opportunities. With the exception of the L/S Equity Long Bias and Special Situations funds, which were penalised for their beta, the other strategies did well in generating stable or slightly negative returns.“Although the lower than normal return to global growth appears to have been integrated into prices, the building risks of a falling market will drive us to continue to favor tactical, macro and relative value styles, which are expected to outperform more directional strategies,” explains Jean-Baptiste Berthon, senior cross-asset strategist for Lyxor AM.
