DSW to demand a special audit of Volkswagen


DSW, the German partner of Proxinvest, has decided to demand a special audit of Volkswagen be decision of the courts. Despite heated debates at the Volkswagen general shareholders’ meeting, the outcome of the vote was no surprise. The largest shareholders in the company, Porsche / Piëch, the region of Lower Saxony and Qatar, which control about 90% of viting rights in the firm, voted against the resolutions by DSW to appoint an independent special auditor.“Due to the shareholder structure and clear position of the largest shareholders before the meeting, it was clear that our resolution would not receive the necessary majority. However, we are convinced that an independent verification to investigate the diesel scandal is necessary. We will therefore demand this special audit by decision of the court,” the chairman of DSW, Ulrich Hocker, announced. “We want transparency for all shareholders, including those who are not represented on the supervisory board or who have no direct contact with the management.” Investors in publicly-traded capital who participate in the general shareholders’ meeting showed signs of agreeing with DSW, as more than 50% of minority shareholder votes were in favour of the special audit resolutions proposed by DSW.These special audits are necessary to verify important details related to ‘Dieselgate, including knowing whether the management and supervisory board at Volkswagen AG violated their legal obligations, thus damaging the firm, an dto check whether the risk management and corporate compliance systems at the firm have been reviewed and corrected adequately since the outbreak of the scandal.
