Hedge funds betting on a rise in soft commodity prices


In the week to 23 August, hedge funds and other major US investors increased their net long positions on 11 futures contracts on soft commodities by 15%, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports, citing figures collected by Bloomberg from the CFTC. These net long positions have not been at such a high level since early May, and may be due to projections that corn and soy harvests will be smaller than expected, leading to high prices for the grains due to the shortage. A similar trend has also been observed on wheat futures markets.
