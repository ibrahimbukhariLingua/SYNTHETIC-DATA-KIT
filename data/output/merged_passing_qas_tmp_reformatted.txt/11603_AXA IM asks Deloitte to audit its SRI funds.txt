AXA IM asks Deloitte to audit its SRI funds


Axa Investment Managers has asked Deloitte to check the compliance of six socially responsible investment funds with its Responsible Investment Principles. The products concerned are the AXA Euro Valeurs Responsables, Label Europe Actions, AXA WF Framlington Human Cap, Label Euro Obligations, AXA Trésor Court Terme, AXA Ethical Distribution Fund. “For several years, we have formalised the principles which govern our RI philosophy. Now, in the absence of formal standards in this area, we wanted a single entity to verify and validate the compliance of investment processes and the management of our RI funds with the principles on the basis of which our clients place their trust in us. The detailed work undertaken by Deloitte on six of our RI funds brings the transparency which our clients expect, and with this contributes to the credibility of our funds,” explains Pascale Sagnier, head of research for the responsible investment department at AXA IM. Deloitte experts analysed the principles used to manage the composition of portfolios and procedures and mechanisms related to the investment process. In a second phase, consultants verified the composition of the portfolio and the transactions undertaken over the past year, fund by fund.
