Olympia merges with Kenmar


The French fund of hedge funds firm Olympia on Monday announced that it has signed an agreement to merge with the US firm Kenmar, a specialist in quant strategies. “The combined firm, to be called the Kenmar Olympia Group, will have USD3.3 billion of assets under management across a broad range of investment management products and services including a proprietary managed account platform, CLariTy Managed Account & Analytics Platform,” a press statement says, while Olympia had USD2.2bn in assets under management according to the most recent available statistics (May 2011). “The group will also offer multi- strategy, macro-focused and thematic funds of funds; customized solutions offering a high level of transparency and liquidity; a private bank offering family office services to large private investors; and, life insurance contracts using funds of mutual funds. The new group will have a global presence with offices in Paris, New York, London, Geneva, Zurich and Singapore,” the statement continues, though it provides no financial details about the merger operation. Under the new structure, Kenmar’s founders Ken Shewer and Marc Goodman will serve as co-executive chairmen and global co-chief investment officers of the Kenmar Olympia Group. Sergio Heuer, the current president and chief executive officer of the Olympia Group of Companies since May 2011, will assume responsibility as president and chief executive officer of the Kenmar Olympia Group. The investment team will be led by Ken Shewer and Marc Goodman who have served as co-chief investment officers of Kenmar since founding the company in 1983. The deal, which the two parties expect to close in July 2012, comes only a year after the closing of the acquisition of Olympia, founded in 1989 by Marc Landeau, by the private equity firm Richmond Park Partners in April 2011. The operation, announced in February 2011, came due to a desire by the former shareholder, Sagar Private Equity Partners, to withdraw from the French alternative asset management firm, which had USD6bn under management before the crisis of 2008.
