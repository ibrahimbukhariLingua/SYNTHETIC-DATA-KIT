Ivy Funds launches two global real estate funds


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Ivy Funds on 1 April announced the launch of two global real estate funds, Ivy Global Real Estate Fund and Ivy Global Risk-Managed Real Estate Fund, which will invest primarily in shares in global realty firms, including real estate investment trusts (REITs) and real estate operating companies (REOC). The first fund is expected to maintain a risk profile equivalent to that of the global real estate market, while the second will aim for a lower risk profile than the first. Last year, inflows to open-ended real estate funds virtually doubled compared with the previous year, to USD15bn, and in the first two months of 2013, subscriptions totalled USD6.5bn, higher than inflows in all of 2010, according to statistics from Simfunds.
