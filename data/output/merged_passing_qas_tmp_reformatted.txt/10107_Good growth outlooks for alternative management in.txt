Good growth outlooks for alternative management in Canada


The hedge fund sector in Canada may double its assets under management in the next five years, according to the president of the Canadian Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA Canada), Gary Ostoich. Assets under management by hedge funds now total about USD30bn. This may seem small compared with the approximately USD2trn under management worldwide, but, the AIMA says, in the wake of the financial crisis, investors are highly sensitive to stricter regulations in the sector, which is subject to the same rules as mutual funds, and the generally highly prodent approach of Canadian financial establishments.
