Switzerland - Reichmuth to launch a new fund of hedge funds to replace Matterhorn


The private bank Reichmuth & Co on Thursday expressed regrets that the Swiss financial markets surveillance authority (Finma) refused its application to create a side pocket containing about one quarter of assets in the Matterhorn fund of hedge funds, which has undergone losses of about 8.5% of its assets due to its Madoff investments (see Newsmanagers of 15 December 2008). The fund will now be liquidated, and about 50% of assets will be redeemed to investors in April. The remainder will be paid on a quarterly basis, and Reichmuth predicts that redemptions will be completed by the end of 2010 at the latest. Until then, as the fund generated performance of 7.4% per year from its launch in 1997 until the end of 2008, compared with 4.2% for the HFRI fund of funds index, Reichmuth has decided to launch another product in the near future using the same strategy.
