Hedge fund industry accelerates consolidation in the UK


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Year after year, the hedge fund sector in the United Kingdom is becoming increasingly concentrated. According to a study published by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the British regulator, the 20 largest companies now control 82% of assets under management, and 94% of gross exposure to market risk. “The study illustrates the extent to which this USD2.6trn industry is important in the United Kingdom,” says Clive Adamson, director of supervision at the FCA. “With nearly 20% in overall assets under management in the country, it is important for people to have confidence in the way we can regulate this market. The challenge for us is to ensure that this market operates at the highest standards of integrity in order for London to be able to maintain its position in this important global market.” Nearly USD470bn are managed by hedge funds in the United Kingdom, with 450 companies registered with the FCA. The study is based on data from September 2013 from 49 companies, with USD481bn in assets under management worldwide, including USD206bn in the United Kingdom, and 106 funds which have USD345bn in assets under management. In the United Kingdom, the industry has grown speedily in the past decade. Although they represented 10% of global assets under management in hedge funds at the beginning of the 2000s, funds managed in the United Kingdom by these hedge funds now represent 18% to 19% of global assets (USD2.63trn). Meanwhile, the study points out that since the financial crisis, institutional investments have become the main source of new money for hedge fund vehicles. They represent 42% of total investment, well ahead of funds of funds (21%) and family offies and high net worth clients (13%). Between September 2010 and September 2013, the proportion of funds of funds fell from 29% to 21%. The study finds that hedge funds have increased their leverage in order to increase their market share and profits. Collectively, British funds have raised a gross total which represents 64 times assets under management, compared with 54 times their assets in March 2013. According to the FCA, of this total leverage, 98% is made using derivatives to gain market exposure.
