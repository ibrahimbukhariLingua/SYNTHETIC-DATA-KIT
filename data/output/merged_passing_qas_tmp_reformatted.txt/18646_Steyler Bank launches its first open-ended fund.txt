Steyler Bank launches its first open-ended fund


For the first time since its creation in Germany (1964) and Austria (2002), Steyler Bank is launching an open-ended fund, the Steyler Fair und Nachhaltig – Aktien, an equitable and sustainable equity fund to be managed by Warburg Invest.The SRI product will rely on stock-picking from oekom research for its selection of equities. It has an ethical council composed of Steyler missionaries (of the Catholic order), specialists in social ethics, and finance professionals. It also relies on information drawn from the global network of Steyler missionaries, known as Finance-scouts.In addition, the firm plans a process of engagement with businesses in the portfolio guilty of unethical practices (exploitation, poverty, injustice).The fund will be invested in a balanced manner in various cap sizes. It will prefer firms which operate to preserve peace, equitable commerce, and conservation of the environment. However, Steyler will exclude businesses which are involved in abortion, alcohol, drugs, tobacco, nuclear energy, embryonic research, gambling, child labour, violations of human rights, pornography, weapons of mass destruction, experimentation on animals, etc.Earnings from management commissions will be used to finance Steyler aid and missionary projects.CharacteristicsName: Steyler Fair und Nachhaltig – AktienISIN code: DE000A1JUVL8Asset management firm: Warburg InvestFront-end fee: 4% (1% for investments of over EUR100,000)Management commission: 1.7% (1.2% over EUR100,000)Depository banking commission: 0.1%
