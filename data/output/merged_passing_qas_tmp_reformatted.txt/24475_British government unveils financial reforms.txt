British government unveils financial reforms


The British government on 27 January published its Financial Services Bill. Under the new legislation, the FSA will cease to exist, while the Bank of England will inherit extended powers, and will become responsible for strengthening financial stability and supervising banks, Agefi reports. Three new organisations will be created: the Financial Policy Committee, whose role will be to contribute to the stability objectives of the Bank of England and to monitor systemic risks; the Prudential Regulation Authority, which will be the future authority to oversee the British banking system, replacing the FSA; and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which will concentrate on protecting consumers and markets.
