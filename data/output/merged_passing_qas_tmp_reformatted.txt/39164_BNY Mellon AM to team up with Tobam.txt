BNY Mellon AM to team up with Tobam


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } BNY Mellon Asset Management is forging an association with Tobam, according to two investment bankers cited by Financial News, in an article about consolidation in the asset management industry. The British newspaper observes that several asset management firms, including Amundi, Robeco, La Fran√ßaise and Henderson, are seeking acquisitions. On the other side, an older generation of managers who created their companies in the 1980s and 1990s, are seeking to sell while the markets remain healthy. Bankers estimate that sale prices are about 13 to 14 times EBITDA, their highest level since 2007.
