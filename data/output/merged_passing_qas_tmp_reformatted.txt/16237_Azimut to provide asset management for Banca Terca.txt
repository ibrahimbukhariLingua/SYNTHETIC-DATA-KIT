The two Italian groups have signed a memorandum of understanding, by which Azimut will become the chief partner for the banking group for investment products, including funds and mandates. The first phase in the agreement will be the integration by March 2011 of the Luxembourg Sicav Tercas Lux from the eponymous group (about EUR75m in assets) into the Azimut AZFUNDI a fund with multiple sub-funds also registered in Luxembourg. Azimut Holding will acquire a 2% stake in the capital of Banca Caripe, which is controlled by Banca Tercas, for EUR5m. Banca Tercas and Banca Caripe will distribute AZFUNDI funds at their branches, which are primarily located in Abruzzo, the Marches, Latium, Molise and Emiglia-Romagna. The Banca Tercas group is an addition to the roughly 100 local banks with which Azimut, which is listed on the Milan stock exchange, already collaborates.
