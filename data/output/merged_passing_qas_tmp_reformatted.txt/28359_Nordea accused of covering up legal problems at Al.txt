Nordea accused of covering up legal problems at Aletheia


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In September 2012, investors were informed that the Nordea 1 North American Growth fund, managed by Aletheia, had fallen to USD53.5m, compared with USD468m two years previously, and would be merged with the Nordea North American All-Cap sub-fund, managed by Eagle Asset Management.On this subject, Financial Times Fund Management (FTfm) reports that several former Nordea employees accuse their former employer of completely concealing from investors the fact that Aletheia, the US outsourced management firm, and its head, Peter Eichler, were sentenced to a fine by the SEC for various fraud and accounting irregularities. In addition, the state of California has imposed a fne of USD2m on the firm, which Aletheia was not able to pay, leading to its bankruptcy.Nordea claims that the accusations by its former employees on the subject of legal issues and accusations concerning Aletheia and Eichler had virtually no impact on the performance of the fund.
