TCW sale: Frédéric Oudéa quashes rumours


According to the news agency Reuters, Frédéric Oudéa, chairman and CEO of Société Générale, yesterday morning announced in a presentation of the firm’s quarterly results that, while some sources were suggesting a possible sale of TCW, the US asset management affiliate of the bank, he would be refraining from comment on what he considers a rumour. “I will comment when the sales are made,” the head said, adding that he and his team were considering “selling some assets, but not urgently.”
