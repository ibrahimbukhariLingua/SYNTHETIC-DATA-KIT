Funds will have conditions for investment in savings banks


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } A survey by Expansi√≥n of major international investors reveals that foreigners are not enthusiastic about the idea of buying stakes in Spanish savings banks. They would like to have a say in matters at the target firms, and therefore would expect seats on the boards of directors, or else they would buy the assets only at a considerable markdown.Among the firms which are potentially interested, but who are awaiting more clarification from the Spanish government, are investors such as Carval, Varde, Fortress, Cerberus, Apollo (which is setting up a team in Spain under the name Lapithus), TPG, Macquarie, Och-Ziff, Lone Star, and Patron.
