Degroof Petercam AM limits access to DPAM L Bonds EUR High Yield Short Term fund


Degroof Petercam Asset Management has announced in a letter to investors that it has decided to soft close access to the DPAM L Bonds EUR High Yield Short Term fund, which invests in high-yield and short term bonds. Assets under management in the fund total over EUR750m, a level near the EUR800m threshold which triggers preventive masures to maintain the performance of the fund.The soft close means that once this ceiling is reached, only existing investors will be permitted to invest further in the strategy.
