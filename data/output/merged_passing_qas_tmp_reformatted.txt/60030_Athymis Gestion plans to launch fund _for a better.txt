Athymis Gestion plans to launch fund “for a better world”


Athymis Gestion, led by Stéphane Toullieux, is soon expected to launch a new thematic fund. After funds dedicated to generation Y, Athymis Millennial and Athymis Millenial Europe, the asset management firm has applied to the financial market authority to license Athymis Better Life for launch. It is an international equity fund which aims to select businesses which help to build a better world, according to the managers in charge of the fund. “The health, energy and renewable energies sectors, new worlds of consumption … are naturally privileged sectors as part of an approach which we wish to be the purest socially responsible investment. We are also choosing exceptional managers, who put humans at the heart of the creation of value, and are not afraid to exclude sectors we feel are damaging to humans and their environments,” says Stéphane Toullieux in his quarterly letter to clients, which NewsManagers has seen. The fund will also donate a proportion of its earnings to charities. Athemis Gestion currently manages EUR130m, and has seven employees.
