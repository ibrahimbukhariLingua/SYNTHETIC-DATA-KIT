Fed prepares markets for a “Japanese” scenario


At a time when investors’ concerns are focusing on the United States’ rising debts, the Fed released a statement which drove the value of the US dollar into a nosedive, which will have the consequence of accelerating growth in the United States, and lowering returns on government bonds, calming concerns about the rising costs of financing the country’s debt, Agefi reports. The US Federal Reserve, as expected, maintained the Federal prime interest rate at between 0% and 0.25%, but for the first time surprised the markets with a pledge to maintain interest rates at an exceptionally low level until mid-2013. This is a sign that the Fed is planning to keep its interest rates at a near-zero level for at least 5 years. This is a paradoxical situation for a country which had been hoping to avoid a Japanese scenario at all costs, the newspaper notes.
