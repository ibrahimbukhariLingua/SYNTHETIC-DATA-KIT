Basel Committee launches a consultation on securitisation


The Basel Committee Banking Supervision on December 18 published a consultative paper entitled Revisions to the Basel Securitisation Framework. The performance of securitisations and the central role they played during the financial crisis were a key motivation for the Basel Committee to perform a broader review of its securitisation framework for regulatory capital requirements. The Committeeâ€™s objectives are to make capital requirements more prudent and risk-sensitive; to mitigate mechanistic reliance on external credit ratings; and to reduce current cliff effects in capital requirements, explains the regulator in a statement. In the coming months, the Committee will conduct a quantitative impact study (QIS) on the proposals. Responses to the public consultation, together with the QIS results, will be considered as the Committee moves forward to revise the securitisation framework. Comments on the proposals should be submitted by Friday 15 March 2013. .bis.org/publ/bcbs236.htm
