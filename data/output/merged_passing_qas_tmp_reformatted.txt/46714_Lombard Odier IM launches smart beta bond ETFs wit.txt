Lombard Odier IM launches smart beta bond ETFs with ETF Securities


Lombard Odier Investment Managers and ETF Securities have partnered to offer a range of transparent, cost-effective and UCITS-compliant fundamentally-weighted fixed income ETFs. The initial product listing on the London Stock Exchange, planned for mid-April, will see the launch of ETFs providing fundamentally-weighted exposure to global government bonds, global corporate bonds and European corporate bonds. An emerging market local bond ETF is scheduled to be launched in early May.Until now, Lombard Odier IM’s fundamental fixed income strategies were only available to mutual fund investors. Lombard Odier IM and ETF Securities have now joined forces to offer smart beta bond opportunities to a wider base of investors through wealth managers, financial advisers and investment platforms."The majority of fixed income investors are in strategies that follow a traditional market capitalisation approach. When investing in equities this approach simply means that investors buy the biggest companies. However, in bond markets, this means lending more to the issuers with the most debt. At the heart of this fundamentally-weighted approach, developed by Lombard Odier IM, is the principle that bond investors are lenders. Therefore bond investing should start with a borrower’s capacity to repay their debts rather than their capacity to borrow more. This approach assesses fundamental factors for government and corporate issuers. For governments, the factors include gross domestic product, debt-to-GDP along with fiscal and political stability. For corporate issuers, each sector’s contribution to the economy is looked at before assessing each individual issuer’s revenues, level of indebtedness, cash flow and asset quality. We believe this produces a more favourable balance between risk and return for investors,» according to LOIM.
