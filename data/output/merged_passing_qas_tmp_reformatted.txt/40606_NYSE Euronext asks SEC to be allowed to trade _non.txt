NYSE Euronext asks SEC to be allowed to trade “non-transparent” ETFs


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } NYSE Euronext on Thursday filed a request with the Securities and Exchange Commission to adopt a new rule that would permit «nontransparent» ETFs to list and trade on its platform, the Wall Street Journal reports. Promoters of ETFs currently have to report the securities held in each portfolio daily. “Non-transparent” ETFs publish this information only on a quarterly basis. The NYSE request comes one day after Precidian Investments submitted the first prospectus laying out the functioning of “non-transparent” ETFs. BlackRock, State Street, Eaton Vance and T. Rowe Price are also militating for the adoption of such ETFs.
