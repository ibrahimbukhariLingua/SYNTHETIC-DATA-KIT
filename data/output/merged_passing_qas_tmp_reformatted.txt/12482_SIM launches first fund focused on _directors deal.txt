SIM launches first fund focused on “directors dealings”


By the end of September, Swiss Investment Managers (SIM), based in Zoug, will launch the Directors Dealings Fund (DDF), a Luxembourg-registered specialised investment fund (SIF) which will be the first long/short hedge fund in Europe or the United States to invest exclusively on the basis of purchases or sales of equities by corporate directors and administrators in their own businesses. The management team will aim to apply a contrarian approach, with an objective of low volatility, and to generate risk-adjusted returns of about 15% per year. The fund will not make use of leverage or derivatives, and will not be exposed to any collateral risks, but will invest in European and North American large and midcaps.
