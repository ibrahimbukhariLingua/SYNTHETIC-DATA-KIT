Erste AM excludes coal mines from its open funds


Erste Asset Management (Erste AM), with assets under management totalling over EUR55bn, has announced that it has decided to exclude companies for which coal production represents more than 30% of earnings from its open funds. At the beginning of the year, on the same basis, Erste had excluded coal mines from its sustainable funds. The asset management firm is one of the first to take such a step. Previously, investment decisions of this kind had been taken by institutional investors. Since 1 August, Erste has introduced an additional measure which applies to sustainable funds. Energy producers for which more than 20% of earnings are related to the use of coal will be excluded.
