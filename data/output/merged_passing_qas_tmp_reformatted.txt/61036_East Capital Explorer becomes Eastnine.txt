East Capital Explorer becomes Eastnine


East Capital Explorer changes its name to Eastnine AB (publ), with new Nasdaq Stockholm ticker symbol “EAST”. The name change to Eastnine is a result of the company’s ongoing transformation from an externally managed investment company to a focused real estate company in the Baltics. ”With the new name Eastnine we want to highlight the new phase that our company is entering. The name Eastnine is based on the geographical direction for our investments, as well as on the date 9 November when the Berlin wall came down in 1989, which ultimately unlocked the Baltic countries for foreign investors”, says Lena Krauss, CFO at Eastnine. In conjunction with the name change, the company’s ticker symbol on Nasdaq Stockholm will change from ”ECEX” to ”EAST”, which is expected to be effective on 2 June, 2017.
