High net worth investors have reduced exposure to Spain by one quarter


According to the most recent statistics from the CNMV, Sicav funds, vehicles used by Spanish high net worth individuals, had assets invested in Spain as of the end of March of EUR12.86bn, compared with EUR17.07bn as of the end of 2007, Expansión reports. As total assets in these Sicav funds totalled EUR31.48bn as of the end of 2007, and EUR26.42bn as of the end of March 2010, this means that the proportion of assets in Spain has fallen from 54% to 41%. Miguel Ángel García, chief investment officer at Banca Patrimonial Banca March, says that high net worth investors have been moving away from Spanish small and midcaps, and subsequently bonos, in favour of bunds. The weakness of the Euro against the US dollar has also driven high net worth clients to North America. Investments in US equities have risen by 11% expressed as a percentage of total investments since the beginning of the year, merely due to currency effects.
