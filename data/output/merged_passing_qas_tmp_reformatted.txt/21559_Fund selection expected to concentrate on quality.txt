Fund selection expected to concentrate on quality


With the financial crisis, many actors, many of them adept on fund platforms, have had to fundamentally revise their strategies. Barclays was offering 350 funds three years ago in its long-only product ranges. Now, the bank offers only 110, Investment Europe reports. “Our strategy puts the priority on quality rather than quantity. In other words, less is more” says Jaime Arguello, head of multi-management at Barclays. In the alternative sector, the Barclays platform includes 35 single manager hedge funds, 12 UCITS funds, and two funds of funds. Assets in Barclays multi-manager funds total about GBP7bn. “There are now more than just equity funds, which makes the selection of funds a primordial activity. The concept of open architecture is based on the idea that a fund manager can’t perform well in all areas. It is important for us to be able to offer our clients the best specialists in each sector.”
