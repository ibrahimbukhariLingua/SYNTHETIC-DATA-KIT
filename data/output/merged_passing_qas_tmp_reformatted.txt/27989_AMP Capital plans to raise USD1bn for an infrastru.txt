AMP Capital plans to raise USD1bn for an infrastructure fund


The Australian fund management firm AMP Capital has already raised AUD305m for its second infrastructure fund, which it hopes to close with about AUD1bn in early 2014, Asian Investor reports. Most investors in the AMP Capital Infrastructure Debt Fund II are Japanese insurers and pension funds, but one of the largest South Korean insurers is also present, as well as Chinese insurers and pension funds. The fund will invest in subordinate debt on infrastructure assets for services including water, gas electricity, transport and communication in Europe, North America and Australia. An initial investment of GBP50m was made in late July in the form of a subordinate loan to Heathrow airport.
