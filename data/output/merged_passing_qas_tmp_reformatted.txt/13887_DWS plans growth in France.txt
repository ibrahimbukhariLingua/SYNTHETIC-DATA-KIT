DWS plans growth in France


Slightly more than two months ago, Philippe J. Goetmann took over as the head of the Paris office of DWS Investments, the asset management firm of the German Deutsche Bank group, from Olivier Renard, who left the group. The Frenchman, who was previously head of the distribution department of DWS in Belgium, is aiming to make the German structure one of the ten largest asset management firms in France in the next three years. Now, with about EUR1bn in assets under management for private banking clients, platforms, life insurers and funds of funds, the firm places about 15th in France, Goettmann says. In terms of assets, this ambition would mean increasing total volume to about EUR1.5bn, although the figure would naturally depend on results at rival management firms and market evolution.In order to develop in France, Goetmann, who will be based in Luxembourg and Paris, will have a team of two people, composed of a senior sales person and a product manager. These will soon be completed with the arrival of a senior salesperson, probably in September.
