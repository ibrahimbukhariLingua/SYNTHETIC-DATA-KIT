Schroders launches website to help millennials engage with finance


Schroders has launched MoneyLens, a new website aimed at helping millennials, those born in the 1980s and 1990s, to engage more with their finances and learn how to manage their money.“The website was created and developed by a group of millennials within Schroders who felt passionately about this subject and wanted to help inform their peers,” said James Cardew, Global Head of Marketing at Schroders.The website will be edited by Vicki Owen, previously a journalist at the Mail on Sunday, and will publish articles written by millennials across all parts of the business at Schroders. The writers will draw on their own personal experiences and expertise to help readers learn how to manage their money. Additional contributors, such as millennial bloggers and advisers, will also be sharing their thoughts and experiences on the website. All content will be jargon free to help people understand how to save and allow them to take charge of their financial future.
