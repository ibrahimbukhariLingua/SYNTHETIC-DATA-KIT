Erste Asset Management plans to build presence in German institutional market


Erste Asset Management is hoping to strengthen its presence serving institutional investors in Germany. In an interview with the Börsen-Zeitung, Christian Schön, a managing board member at the Austrian asset management firm, which has a total of EUR45bn under management, slightly over EUR1bn of which comes from the German market, says the firm is planning to emphasize Eastern Europe products. Bonds from this region appear to him to be a good alternative to equities for pension funds, insurers, and businesses. “We are planning to construct custom product offerings for these clients,” says Schön.
