P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } “The asset management sector is at a turning point. The sector is on the verge of a new period of growth.” On this note of optimism, Tom Brown, a partner at KPMG and global head of the Investment Management Practice, opened the debate at the Fund Forum International, being held until Thursday in Monaco.In addition to the improving economic context, three factors will drive this growth, he says: opportunities due to mega-trends (demography, scarcity of resources, etc.), reforms in the banking sector, and lastly, retirement and health.CEOs invited to speak on panels are calling for better education of investors. Some asset management firms are already participating in such errors, such as Nikko Asset Management and Franklin Templeton. Robert Higginbotham, chairman of T. Rowe Price, called on asset management firms to put regulatory issues in the foreground and to set higher standards for fiduciary duty.In an intervention designed to raise audience awareness, the musician and activist Sir Bob Geldof, also chairman of a private equity firm, called on investors to look to Africa.Emerging markets also take a place of honour at this year’s Fund Forum International, not only in interventions in this area. Several asset management firms from these countries are present, with stands, in order to increase their reputations in Europe.
