Barings adds to Asian team


Baring Asset Management on Monday confirmed that Henry Chan, head of Asia Pacific Investment, will be leaving the business. The British asset management firm is now seeking a candidate for the newly-created position of CIO of Baring Asset Management Asia. In the meanwhile, the managing directors of the Asian affiliate will report directly to Tim Scholefield, head of global equities. The objective of the new recruitment will be to take the Asian equities division to a higher level, and to make the necessary performance improvements to several Asian mandates. Recently (see Newsmanagers of 15 February, 2010), Barings recruited Colin Ng as head of Asia Equities and Adrian Au as head of Asian alternatives. Currently, the British asset management firm is also seeking a manager of Chinese equities, an analyst for Taiwan equities, and personnel for quantitative support.
