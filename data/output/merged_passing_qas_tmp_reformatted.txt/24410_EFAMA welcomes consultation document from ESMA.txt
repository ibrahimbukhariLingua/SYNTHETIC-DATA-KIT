EFAMA welcomes consultation document from ESMA


The European fund and asset management association (EFAMA) on 31 January welcomed the recommendations of the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) for UCITS-compliant ETF funds.“EFAMA recognizes that this consultation document follows a considered and nuanced approach which will help to improve the already robust regulation of UCITS products, in order to ensure that all UCITS products are even safer for investors, a requirement which is at the core of the priorities of the association,” says Peter De Proft, CEO of EFAMA.However, EFAMA continues, the paradox is that UCITS vehicles, particularly UCITS-compliant ETFs, appear to be more closely monitored by regulators than non-UCITS ETPs, such as ETNs which are far less regulated. “EFAMA is concerned by these imbalances, and thus encourages ESMA and other regulators to concentrate on all these products,” De Proft continues, adding that EFAMA reiterates its support for the planned PRIPS directive, which would put all retail financial products on an even footing.Following this general appreciation, the professional association will undertake a detailed analysis of ESMA’s proposals in order to provide a finer appreciation of its point of view.
