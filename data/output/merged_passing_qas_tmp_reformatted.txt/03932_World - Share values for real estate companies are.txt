World - Share values for real estate companies are six months ahead of the physical property markets


In general, shares in real estate companies or REITs tend to lead their underlying markets by approximately six months, according to a survey by the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) commissioned to the US investment company Cohen & Steers. Liquidity appears to bring a higher level of pricing transparency and a more rapid transfer of information on REIT markets than on the less liquid physical property markets.The study, published on Monday, also reveals that publicly traded real estate markets show more pronounced peaks and troughs than the direct markets, which may be related to the fact that data on the performance of publicly traded real estate shares includes leverage, which is not the case for the physical market, though investors in these markets also rely on leverage.Cohn & Steers estimate that although the publicly traded real estate markets incorporate a higher level of risk than the physical real estate markets, it is likely that the underlying real risk of the direct market is strongly underestimated due to the effects of appraisal smoothing. For example, the standard deviation for the physical property market in the United States is only slightly higher than government bonds, and for the British and Australian physical property markets, it is even lower than for government bonds.
