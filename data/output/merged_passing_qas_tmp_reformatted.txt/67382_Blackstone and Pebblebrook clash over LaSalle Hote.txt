Blackstone and Pebblebrook clash over LaSalle Hotel Properties


The US hotel group LaSalle Hotel Properties on 27 August confirmed in a statement that an improved takeover bid received last week from Pebblebrook Hotel trust may lead to a “higher offer,” further raising the stakes in bidding with Blackstone Group. LaSalle had in June accepted an offer from Blackstone at USd33.50 per share, all in cash, which would have valued the firm at over USD3.7bn.Pebblebrook has made two competing bids, the latest at USD37.80, but with a large part paid in shares, which led LaSalle to continue to recommend the cash offer from Blackstone. Pebblebrook went back on the offensive last week, offering to pay for 30% of the equities that would change hands in cash, up from 20% previously.In a staement, LaSalle says that it is bound by the terms of the agreement signed with Blackstone, and recommends that its board of directors continue to support this offer, but it does not rule out a “higher offer” which would change the situation. Shareholders in the group will vote on the Blackstone bid on 6 September.The two-thirds majority required may be difficult to achieve, to the extent that Pebblebrook has become the fourth-largest shareholder in the group, with a stake of 9.8%. According to Reuters, the speculative fund HG Vora Capital Management, which controls 8.15% of LaSalle, has already announced plans to vote against the Blackstone bid, and the boards of directors of shareholders Glass Lewis & Co and ISS have also recommended rejecting the bid. LaSalle had rejected the unsolicited offer from Pebblebrook on the grounds that its equity and cash components made it more risky for shareholders.
