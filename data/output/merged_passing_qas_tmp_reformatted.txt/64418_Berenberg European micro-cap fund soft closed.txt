Berenberg European micro-cap fund soft closed


Berenberg on 20 December announced that the institutional part of the Berenberg European Micro Cap fund, managed by Peter Kraus, will no longer be available for sale starting from 14 December, to new or to existing investors. The asset management division of the private bank states that the institutional portfolio has reached its capacity limits, which has triggered the present soft close. However, the retail portfolio, with assets under management totalling EUR388m, has not yet reached its limit, and is not subject to any investment constraints to date.
