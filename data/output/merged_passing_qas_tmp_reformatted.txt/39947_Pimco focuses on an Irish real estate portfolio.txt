Pimco focuses on an Irish real estate portfolio


The California-based asset management group Pimco (Allianz) would like to buy a portfolio of real estate loans totalling EUR4bn from the Northern Irish national asset management association, SWF Institute reports. Several institutional actors have expressed an interest in this portfolio, which has led NAMA to publish a statement indicating that investor enquiries in relation to the portfolio will be examined on a case-by-case basis. However, the Pimco initiative is not fortuitous. The asset management firm has recently added to its staff in the European bond sector, including the real estate loan sector.
