Spain - Santander begins liquidation of Banif Inmobiliario


Subscribers to the Santander Banif Immobiliario fund are stuck in a trap. Santander Real Estate has applied to the CNMV for permission to suspend redemptions from the largest real estate fund in Spain for two years, and to undertake sales of the fund’s assets, which will allow it to gradually meet redemption demands from investors, Cinco Días reports. The Banif Inmobiliario fund has more than 51,000 subscribers and assets of more than EUR3.26bn. Redemption demands added up to EUR2.62bn as of 13 February, which represents 80% of assets under management, and the bank has opted for a staged liquidation, confronted with a situation where the management firm lacks sufficient liquidity to meet redemption demands of this scale. Investors who have already applied for redemptions, or who do so before 27 February, will initially receive only a portion of their investment, probably about 10%. The redemptions will be served on the basis of the fund’s revised net asset value, which will depend on extraordinary valuations of the portfolio undertaken in January and February, which may result in a downward revision of 9-10%. The first pro rata redemption payments will be made on 9 March and 5 May.
