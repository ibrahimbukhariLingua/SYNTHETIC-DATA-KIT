Warburg Pincus and Natixis focus on SIX Group payment activities


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } Three potential buyers, including a consortium of Natixis and the investment fund Warburg Pincus, are vying for the payments division of the Swiss stock exchange operator SIX Group, three sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters. The US investment fund Hellman & Friedman, which controls the Danish payment company Nets, and the French firm Wordline are also preparing competing bids by the deadline of 27 April, sources say. Bidding being organised by JPMorgan is to be completed in early May, and one of the three bidders will then enter exclusive talks with SIX next week, they add. SIX, Natixis and Worldline have refused to comment. Hellman & Friedman and Warburg Pincus could not be reached immediately. The payments division of SIX, which has clients including the retail operators Migros and Coop and some European airports, including Amsterdam and Vienna airports, was valued at CHF1.5bn to CHF2bn (EUR1.25bn to EUR1.67bn), sources say. The bid prepared by Natixis and Warburg Pincus would give SIX access to the French market, as SIX would acquire a 50% stake in a new payment company to be founded in partnership with Natixis, sources say.
