Investing in vice proves profitable


Expansión reports that the Vice Fund from USA Mutuals on 18 December posted returns of 21.49%, or a gain nearly four percentage points higher than the S&P 500. Over 10 years, the performance of the fund, which invests in alcohol, tobacco, gambling and weapons, was 10.61%, and even over the past five years of crisis, the fund shows gains averaging 1.11%. The Vice Fund invests, for example, in Altria, Lorillard, Philip Morris International, Galaxy Entertainment Group and Diageo. By comparison, the best ethical and socially responsible fund in Spain is the Microbank Fondo Etico from Caixabank, which has gained only 9.08%, while the Sabadell BS Inversión Ética y Solidaria has earned only 3.40% and the BMN Ético y Solidario has lost 6.64%. But these funds are diversified, while the Vice Fund is a purely equity product.
