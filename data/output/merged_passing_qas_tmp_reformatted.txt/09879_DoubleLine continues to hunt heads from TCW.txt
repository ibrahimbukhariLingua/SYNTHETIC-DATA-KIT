DoubleLine continues to hunt heads from TCW


On Tuesday evening, DoubleLine Capital, the management firm founded by Jeff Gundlach, announced the recruitment of Luz Padilla, former lead portfolio manager and managing director of TCW Emerging Markets Fixed Income Group. She joins DoubleLine along with two of the most senior members of her team, Mark Christensen and Su Fei Koo. Padilla will be responsible for investment in emerging market debt, while Christensen and his colleague will be in charge of research on sovereign debt and emerging market credit. The point which makes the move more striking is that Gundlach was CIO of TCW (Société Générale group) until his abrupt dismissal in early December.
