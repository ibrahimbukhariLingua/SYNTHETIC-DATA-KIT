Norwegian sovereign fund predicts correction on equity markets


Yngve Slyngstad, CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), has announced that he predicts a correction in equity prices, Handelsblatt reports. That explains the fact that allocation to equities by the Government Pension Fund – Global (GPFG, EUR586bn), formerly known as the Oil Fund, managed by NBIM under an outsourcing contract from the Bank of Norway, has not been increased since the beginning of the year, despite the rising stock prices.Inflows were not allocated to the purcase of equities, but instead to investments in bonds, or have been retained in cash. “We would prefer to invest more in real estate, but that takes time,” the CEO of NBIM says.He adds that in general, he feels that market corrections are more of an opportunity than a danger. “When they happen, we feel that it is a positive sign.”
