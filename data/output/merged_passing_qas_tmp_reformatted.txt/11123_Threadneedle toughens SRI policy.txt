Threadneedle toughens SRI policy


The British asset management firm Threadneedle Investments (EUR76.2bn in assets as of the end of June) on 2 November announced that, in keeping with the United Nations convention on cluster bombs, which came into force on 1 August 2010, it will no longer invest in shares in firms which produce “controversial” weapons. This will extend not only to cluster bombs, but also to land mines, chemical weapons and depleted Uranium.The decision comes as a part of Threadneedle’s socially responsible investment (SRI) policy, and respect for environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. However, Threadneedle has not ruled out short positions on these assets.The British asset management firm points out that its SRI policies were developed internally, and are based on the best international practices, including the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), the UN Global Compact, and the UK Stewardship Code.
