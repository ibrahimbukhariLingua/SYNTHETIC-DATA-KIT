Reyl group recruits a head of asset management from Pictet &amp; Cie


The Reyl group has recruited Francesco Genovese as head of the asset management business. Genovese joins from Pictet & Cie, where for more than 15 years he served in various senior roles. He was head of institutional sales in Europe and the Middle East. At Reyl, Genovese will be responsible for developing asset management and fund distribution activities at Bank REYL & Cie, with a particular focus on establishing alternative and unlisted asset strategies for both Swiss and international institutional clients. Through a combination of strategic recruitment and formal alliances with talented managers, Genovese will focus initially on establishing a high-quality platform for alternative asset management at REYL & Cie. As a part of this initiative, Reyl & Cie will develop niche strategies. The themes of private equity, particularly in the field of new technologies, private debt and real estate will be considered as priorities. “Following our partial withdrawal from RAM active investments, a leader in the active management of liquid assets, we are committed to bolstering our offering of alternative products, especially in unlisted assets,” says François Reyl, CEO. p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; }
