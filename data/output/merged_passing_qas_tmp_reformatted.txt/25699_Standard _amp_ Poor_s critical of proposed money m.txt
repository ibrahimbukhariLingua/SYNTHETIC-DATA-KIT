Standard &amp; Poor’s critical of proposed money market reforms


Proposals by the European Commission to reinforce regulation of money market funds domiciled and sold in Europe could improve risk management for most operators and investors in Europe, according to a study which has recently been published by the ratings agency Standard & Poor’s (“EC Regulation For Money Market Funds May Have Unintended Consequences.”) However, the agency continues, the overall size of the European money market fund sector may fall if regulations are adopted as they are. Some clauses in the regulations are positive for the sector as a whole, but some of them may complicate the management of money market risks, Standard & Poor’s estimates. Money market funds with a set net asset value, which account for more than 40% of European money market funds, may face considerable economic and operating costs, to be converted into variable funds or to retain their status at a cost in the vicinity of at least 3% of net asset value.
