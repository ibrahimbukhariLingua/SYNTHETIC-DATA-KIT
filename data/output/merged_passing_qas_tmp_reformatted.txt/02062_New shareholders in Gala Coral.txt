New shareholders in Gala Coral


Intermediate Capital and ParkSquare will exchange GBP540m in loans to Gala Coral for a 50% stake in the operator of bingo halls and bookmakers, which is currently owned by the private equity investors Candover, Cinven and Permira, the Sunday Times reports. Negotiations will be concluded by the end of the month, and will allow Gala Coral to obtain loans from Intermediate Capital and ParkSquare that will allow it to pay down its debts of GBP2.6bn, without current shareholders having to inject fresh capital.
