Private equity: clean technologies market set to continue growth


SAM, the affiliate of Robeco dedicated exclusively to sustainable investment, has published its second study of the global private equity market in the area of clean tech, entitled “Clean Tech Private Equity: past, present, and future.” The results of the study show that the market is seeing a new wave of growth, which investors may exploit through targeted investments.The clean tech industry in particular appears to be set to continue its higher than average growth. It is benefiting from high levels of cost competitiveness compared with traditional energies, and strong demand for clean and safe energy solutions. A wide range of sectors specialised in clean tech will no longer depend on government aid in the future. Meanwhile, there are a growing number of opportunities for profitable exits (initial public offerings, mergers, and acquisitions) for private equity investors.
