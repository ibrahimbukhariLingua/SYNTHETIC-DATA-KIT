Best-performing managers are not more expensive


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Contrary to what one may imagine, the best-performing managers are not so costly in terms of management fees. These are the findings of a recent study published by the consulting firm bfinance. The study, dedicated to management commissions charged in the universe of instituitonal investments, is based on nearly 3,200 rating grids sent in by 650 asset management firms as part of 100 requests for proposals to select institutional managers. According to bfinance, the managers who generate the most alpha, which is to say the ones who regularly outperform their benchmarks, do not charge higher management commissions than their less well-performing competitors. On the contrary, the best managers charge slightly lower than average management fees, the study finds (see table attached to the article). Another finding of the study is that the size of the mandate has a direct impact on the management fees. Between a EUR100m mandate and a EUR400m mandate, the average level of management commissions set at first offer (before negotiations) falls by 15%. More generally, bfinance notes that over the past three years, management fees have held stable, with the exception of low volatility products, which have increased strongly in number in recent years. bfinance also notes that remuneration formulas based on performance commissions are more common than a few years ago. 32% of managers have introduced such a performance threshold of at least 2%, before being allowed to charge performance commissions.
