US authorities express concerns over leveraged ETFs


Two investigations have recently been launched into leveraged ETFs, which FINRA, the body that regulates brokers in the United States, considers overly complex and therefore ill-suited to retail investors. Meanwhile, the State of Massachusetts has launched an investigation into the sales practices of three providers, Rydex Investments, Direxion Funds and ProShares, all of which rank among the top ten providers on the US market. In Europe, retail investors represent less than 10% of the market, compared with 60% of the US market.
