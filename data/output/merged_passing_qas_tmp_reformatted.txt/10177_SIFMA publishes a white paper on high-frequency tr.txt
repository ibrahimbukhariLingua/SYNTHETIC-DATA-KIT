SIFMA publishes a white paper on high-frequency trading


The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), which brings together the shared interests of hundreds of securities firms, banks and asset managers, has released a white paper addressing high-frequency trading (HFT).The paper notes the lack of a clear definition for high-frequency trading, but seeks to address the concerns being raised by members of the public and other market participants regarding HFT. It discusses current regulatory efforts to strengthen market structure, areas where regulators should conduct further study and possibly address through regulatory action, and regulatory proposals that SIFMA believes should not be pursued. The professional association also says it opposes the introduction of new taxes on financial transactions, and is opposed to a wholesale ban on high-frequency trading or other forms of computer-based trading.The white paper can be found at the following link: http://www.sifma.org/issues/item.aspx?id=8589936694
