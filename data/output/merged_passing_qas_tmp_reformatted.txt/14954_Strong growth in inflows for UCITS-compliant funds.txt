Strong growth in inflows for UCITS-compliant funds in February


UCITS funds in February saw a net inflows of nearly EUR27bn, compared with EUR12bn the previous month, according to statistics from the European fund and asset management association (EFAMA). This rapid growth month on month, at a rate not seen since August 2010, is due to strong inflows to diversified funds (EUR9.2bn, compared with EUR4.1bn in January), and a return of investors to money market funds, which in February attracted EUR7.6bn, compared with outflows of EUR10.7bn in January). Long-term UCITS funds (excluding money market funds) posted a net inflow of EUR19bn, compared with EUR23bn in January. Equities funds attracted EUR2.6bn, compared with EUR9bn in January. Non-UCITS vehicles, for their part, gained EUR9bn in February, compared with EUR13bn the previous month. This decline is related to lower inflows for dedicated funds. Since the end of January, UCITS funds gained 1.2%, to EUR5.921trn, while non-UCITS funds were up 0.9%, to EUR1.958trn.
