Fidelity France reshuffles sales team


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The range of products dedicated to the independent financial advisor (IFA) market at Fidelity France is now in place. At the completion of a reshuffle of sales forces, led by Olivier Gourragne, chairman of Fidelity France, in which Ivan Monème, director of institutional communication, has been given responsibility for marketing and communication, the management firm has recruited Cédric Michel as head of distribution activities. The objective is to replace Michel Audeban, former director of sales and distribution, who left the firm early in 2011. Michel, who will now be in charge of IFAs and online brokers as well as other channels, is not unknown at Fidelity: he previously worked at Natixis Asset Management with Stéphan de Quelen, also a former employee of the Paris-based management firm, before becoming head of partnerships in early 2009. The only thing left was to develop a well-calibrated and convincing range of funds for IFAs. For this purpose, in addition to the range of traditional funds, Fidelity Funds is planning to win over new clients with an especially-created French-registered product: Fidelity Patrimoine. As its name indicates, the OPCVM fund will play the performance card, but will also include capital protection for investors who rely on flexible management, which is highly popular with IFAs.
