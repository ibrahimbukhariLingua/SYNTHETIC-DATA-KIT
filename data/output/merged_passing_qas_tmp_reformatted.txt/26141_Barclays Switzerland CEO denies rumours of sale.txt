Barclays Switzerland CEO denies rumours of sale


The new CEO of Barclays Switzerland, Simon Gaston, has denied all rumours that the Swiss affiliate of the British banking group will be sold, according to Agefi Switzerland. The firm will have to improve its contribution to the group’s profits, however. “We are 100% committed to our presence in Switzerland, which continues to offer superb opportunities for growth,” says Gaston, cited by the newspaper. According to the CEO, “Switzerland will remain one of the ‘hubs’ of the group, as some operational processes developed here have already been deployed at other locations.” The CEO of Barclays Switzerland, which has 400 employees and CHF25bn in assets under management, estimates, however, that the firm needs to “improve its contribution to the profits of the group.”
