Regulatory green light for real estate fund activities at Universal-Investment


BaFin, the German financial services watchdog, on 19 October issued a license for the launch and administration of real estate funds to Universal-Investment, which had applied for the license to create an operation in the institutional fund segment.Bernd Vorbeck, chairman of the executive board at Universal, says that the first mandates have already been received, and that talks are underway with several institutional investors and asset management firms. The new real estate platform represents a logical extension of the fund accounting and administration (Master-KAG) range aimed at institutionals; it also allows asset management firms to locate a neutral platform for real estate fund projects for their clients.At the same time as the license for real estate funds, Universal-Investment has also been granted permission to launch and manage hedge funds, infrastructure funds, employee savings funds, and funds with a European passport.
