Cost of some small ETFs is excessive


With the increasing number of complex products available, the average commission charged by ETFs in the United States, according to Citi, stands at 0.56%, compared with 0.40% as of the end of 2005. Currently, ETFs from State Street have average initial assets of USD5-10m, compared with USD20m a few years ago, the Wall Street Journal reports. As of the end of July, total assets in ETF funds totalled USD640bn, but 13 products had assets under management of over USD10bn each, and their spreads are under 0.09%. However, there are more than 200 ETFs whose spreads are over 0.5%, which is not acceptable, says Matt Hougan, director of ETF analysis at IndexUniverse.com. This would mean that an investor who buys and sells shares in the fund will lose 1% of his or her investment due to differences between the buy and sell price of the shares, which adds up to more than the commissions charged by most ETFs.
