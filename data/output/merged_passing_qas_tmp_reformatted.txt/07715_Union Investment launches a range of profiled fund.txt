Union Investment launches a range of profiled funds


At a presentation of results for first half 2010 (see article in this issue of Newsmanagers), Union Investment announced the launch of a range of flexible and profiled wealth management funds, the PrivatFonds Flexibel, Kontrolliert and Konsequent, with a minimal initial subscription of EUR10,000. Though the asset management firm charges no front-end fee, there is a management commission totalling 1% to 1.55%. The funds, which are actively managed, are invested in a wide variety of asset classes, options, certificates, and third-party funds. The new PrivatFonds are each available in a normal and a “pro” version. The Flexibel and Flexibel pro are aimed at investors seeking to exploit the potential of different markets, as the Flexibel has a neutral position on money market funds, while the Flexibel pro has no limitation in its distribution by asset class. The Kontrolliert and Kontrolliert pro are focused on volatility management, with the objective of generating performance higher than that of a traditional diversified portfolio of equities and bonds. The Konsequent and Konsequent pro, for their part, bring the concept of protected institutional funds of the Immuno range to retail investors. With the Konsequent funds, investors accept a protection of 97% of their initial capital, while with the Kapital pro, the protection is limited to 90%. However, if higher peaks are recorded in a 12-month period, a high watermark makes it possible to capture them for subsequent periods. In both cases, Union aims for higher performance than for a «safe» investment at a fixed rate in the mid to long term for both products.
