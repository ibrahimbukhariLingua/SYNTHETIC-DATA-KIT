One in four Swiss do not know who manages their pension


One in four Swiss respondents (24%) are unaware of which pension fund manages its second retirement pillar (professional retirement planning). Although interest in professional retirement planning appears to be higher than average in German-speaking Switzerland and Ticino, only two thirds of French-speaking Swiss are concerned about it, according to the second survey carried out by AXA Investment Managers. Overall, 29% of policyholders surveyed have no interest in retirement planning, according to the study “Knowledge of the Swiss population concerning pension funds 2013,” presented earlier this week in Zurich. More than one quarter of them consider themselves still too young to think about it. One respondent in five considers the subject too complicated for themselves, ways Werner Rutsch, head of the study by AXA Investment Managers. About 10% avoid the subject squarely on the grounds that they have no influence over their pension.
