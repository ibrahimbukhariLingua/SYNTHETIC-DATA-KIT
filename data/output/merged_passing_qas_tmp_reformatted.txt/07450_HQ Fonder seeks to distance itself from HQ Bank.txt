HQ Fonder seeks to distance itself from HQ Bank


The asset management firm HQ Fonder has said in a press release that clients investing in HQ funds will not be affected by the cancellation of the banking license for HQ Bank over the weekend, nor by the fact that the Swedish bank has been placed in liquidation. The management firm emphasizes that it has been wholly owned by Investment AB Öresund since June 2010, when it was acquired from HQ AB, and that its activities are entirely distinct from HQ Bank. “It should also be noted that each fund is a distinct legal entity with assets which belong to the shareholders, and which are placed with SEB,” the statement says. HQ Fonder adds that both it and its parent are in solid financial condition.
