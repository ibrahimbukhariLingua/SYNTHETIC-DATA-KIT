Activist Elliott tells Pernod there is still work to do


Activist investor Elliott has kept up the pressure on French spirits group Pernod Ricard, welcoming last week’s first-half results but calling for boardroom changes and better margins.Elliott, which has built a stake of just over 2.5 percent in Pernod Ricard, has called on the family-backed group to raise profit margins to bring them more inline with these of British rival Diageo. Elliott has suggested 500 million euros ($565 million) in cost cuts and options such as merging with another spirits company. The hedge fund, which has become increasingly active in Europe in recent years, issued a statement on Friday after Pernod’s results this week when the group raised its profit growth outlook for 2018-2019 and unveiled new margin goals in a three-year strategy plan. «Pernod’s half-year earnings announcement confirmed the strong growth potential and solid financial performance of the company. It also reflected a first small step in starting to address the company’s shortcomings in operational efficiency,» Elliott said. Last month, Pernod Ricard took a step towards governance improvement, naming Patricia Barbizet to the newly created role of lead independent director. Nevertheless, Elliott on Friday made clear it wanted more. «Necessary enhancements to the company’s board and corporate governance have yet to be addressed,» Elliott said. Elliott also said Pernod’s targeted savings of 100 million euros and a margin step-up of 50-60 basis points per year over the next three years were «modest goals» for a company of its size.
