Petercam opens an office in Milan


The Belgian asset management firm Petercam is going to open a representative office in Milan, Italy, in the first week of September, in Via Monte di Piet√†. The office will be occupied by Alessandro Fonzi, who was recruited in June as country head Italy. The Italian-Swiss Fonzi, who has 22 years of experience in finance and banking, previously worked at Lombard Odier, where since 2009 he had been head of the Italian market for institutional and professional clients. At Petercam, he will be responsible for development of the Italian-speaking markets (Italy and Swiss Tessino), under the direction of Ives Hup, head of sales for France and Italy. Hup had previously been responsible for the Italian market from Brussels. Fonzi will cover both institutional and private clients. The new development follows the opening of offices in Spain and Germany, announced by Petercam in March this year.
