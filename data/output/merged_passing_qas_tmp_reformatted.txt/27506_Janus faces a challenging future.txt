Janus faces a challenging future


Janus, which had once been the asset management firm with the best sales of mutual funds in the United States, will have to face a number of problems, Financial Times fund management observes. The group has seen outflows of over USD7bn from its equity funds, and more than USD2bn from its flagship fund (Janus fund) between January and July. The poor performance of the fund and the reduced appetite for growth funds explain that. The redemptions also coincide with the departure of top managers: Brian Shaub, Chad Meade and Ron Sachs. Analysts are being shared over capacity at Janus to recover.
