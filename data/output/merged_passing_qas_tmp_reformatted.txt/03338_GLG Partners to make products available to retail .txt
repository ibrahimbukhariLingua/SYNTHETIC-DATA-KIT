GLG Partners to make products available to retail clients


GLG Partners is hoping to be on the cutting edge of the convergence between alternative and traditional investment, Financial Times Fund Management reports. In an interview, Pierre Lagrange, one of the founders of the management firm, says the entity inherited a range of long-only funds with its acquisition of SGAM UK, which has since been renamed GLG, and is planning to launch some of its offshore funds in UCITS III envelopes, so as to make them available on the UK retail market.
