Gartmore hit by net redemptions due to suspension of Guillaume Rambourg


Between 1 January and 30 April 2010, Gartmore has suffered net redemptions of GBP708m, of which GBP634m were in the month of April alone. Net outflows in the period from 31 March to 4 May were largely a result of the temporary suspension of the fund manager Guillaume Rambourg, due to an internal investigation by the UK asset management firm. As of the end of March, assets at Gartmore totalled GBP23.5bn, a 6% increase compared with the end of 2009. But as of the end of April, assets had fallen back to GBP22.4bn, in the wake of redemption demands in the month of April. The asset manager had seen outflows of GBP380m from its hedge funds as of 4 May.
