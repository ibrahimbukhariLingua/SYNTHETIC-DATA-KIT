CPR AM lists its best funds on Allfunds Bank platform


CPR AM is accelerating its dynamic of international fund distribution, by signing a distribution agreement with Allfunds Bank Group, one of the global leaders in distribution of funds. More than 30 funds from leading expert areas at CPR AM (equities, fixed income, credit, multi-asset) are now available on the Allfunds Bank and Allfunds International platform listings. Among the funds selected are thematic equities, with CPR Invest – Global Silver Age, CPR Invest – Global Disruptive Opportunities, the multi-asset products of the CPR Croissance fund range, the multi-factor investing expertise, with CPR Global Equity All Regime, pure inflation with CPR Global Inflation US, and credit, with CPR Credixx Invest Grade.With more than EUR770m in net inflows for mid- and long-term strategies internationally, this is incontestable proof that CPR AM is on the way to realizing its objectives by 2020: exceeding EUR50bn in assets, while making half of its inflows from international markets, a statement says.To achieve this goal, the presence of CPR AM on the Allfunds Bank platform (AFB) is fundamental. The Allfunds Bank platforms which cover the Europe and international region, which are used in supplement to the first to cover added global regions, benefit from their positions as global leaders in management positions, and gain international visibility due to their major role tying asset management firms and fund distributors. “The reach of the Allfunds Bank Group to more than 500 institutional clients, insurance companies, and private bankers worldwide gives CPR AM an opportunity to spread the best invesment solutions and conquer new market share,” a statement says.
