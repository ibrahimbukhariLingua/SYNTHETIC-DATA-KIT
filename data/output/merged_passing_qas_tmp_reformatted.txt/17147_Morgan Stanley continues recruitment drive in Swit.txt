p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Agefi Switzerland reports that Morgan Stanley, which last year recruited 41 new employees, will continue the campaign this year. With CHF12bn to CHF15bn in assets under management by 170 employees in Geneva (with 50) and Zurich, the private bank is also preparing two moves in 2011. The Geneva office will soon be moving from its location on the place de la Fusterie to a new office space twice as large, also located in the centre of Geneva. In Zurich, growth will also require a move to a larger space.
