CESR calls for more transparency for ETFs and newcits


In a speech at the Fund Forum in Monaco last week, Eddy Wymeersch, chairman of the committee of European securities regulators (CESR), claimed that professionals and not regulators should be responsible for improving the transparency of UCITS-compliant ETFs and hedge funds, the Financial Times reports. He says some newcits are not really aimed at retail clients, and that there should be a mechanism to clearly indicate that retail investors should not invest in those products. On the subject of ETFs, Wymeersch would like to see issuers be required to provide more information about underlying assets, and to improve the information available on their websites. The CESR president also recommends that fund management firms improve their governance.
