Ethos Foundation in turmoil


Nothing is right at Ethos. Françoise Bruderer, a board member at the Ethos foundation, and Monika Roth, who had chaired the board of directors at Ethos Services, both resigned a few days ago. Both have in the past few days in the media made passionate denunciations of the governance at Ethos, which on its website claims to be “the Foundation for responsible investment and shareholder activism.” In a statement, the Ethos Foundation expresses surprise at these claims, both in form and in substance, and particularly accusations related to conflicts of interest. The foundation says that it is particularly sensitive to rules of good governance, and points out that for many years, transparent rules and procedural guidelines have been in place, including those to manage conflicts of interest. “It has been decided to refill the places left vacant on the boards as quickly as possible. This move will form a part of the global succession plan put in place to ensure the survival of the Foundation following the gradual departure of its founders,” the foundation says in a statement. The board at the Ethos foundation and the board of directors at Ethos Services had already unanimously decided to initiate an evaluation procedure for these successions to the board. The process aims to demonstrate good corporate governance and is being carried out with the assistance of an external consultant, the firm explains. It will be accelerated from the start of next year. It is understood that the questions raised concerning conflicts of interest will continue to be handled by the two vice-chairmen. Hanspeter Uster, vice-chairman of the board at the Ethos foundation, and Philippe Doffey, vice-chairman of the board of directors at Ethos Services, say “the Boards at Ethos confirm their complete confidence and support for the chairman.”
