US government agency to promote socially progressive investment


OPIC (the Overseas Private Investment Corporation), the US government agency that assists US businesses with their development in emerging markets, has launched a call for tenders to promote the development of impact investing, or investment which has a positive social impact or social utility. OPIC is proposing to provide USD250m in funding for the project, which represents the largest engagement by the US government to date in promoting socially useful investment, a statement says. OPIC invites qualified fund managers to propose investment funds which would make it possible to create a socially progressive investment portfolio in emerging markets where OPIC is present. The call for contributions, open until 12 May, includes equities, deby and hybrid strategies. According to estimates, impact investing, which represented about Usd50bn last year, could account for as much as USD500bn by 2020.
