2012 won’t be grey, but “black and white,” says Michel Cicurel


The chairman of the board at La Compagnie Financière Edmond de Rothschild, Michel Cicurel, is not hiding his concern about the opening months of 2012. “I am not a maniac predicting the end of the world, but I think we have never been this close,” he says in an interview with Les Echos. “The only way to avoid falling into the abyss is to get close enough to each other that decisions can be taken. The coming year will nto be grey, but black and white. It will be black up until the verge of the abyss, and then white, because our leaders will ultimately reach last-minute agreements to save us from the worst. For two years, a stupefying series of oversights and mistakes have accumulated,” says Cicurel, and “the biggest mistake was wanting to make banks pay to restructure Greek debt.”
