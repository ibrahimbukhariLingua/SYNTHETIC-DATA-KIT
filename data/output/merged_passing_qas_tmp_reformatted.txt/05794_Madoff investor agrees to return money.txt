Madoff investor agrees to return money


One of Bernard Madoff’s oldest investors, Carl Shapiro, and several of his family members have reached an agreement to forfeit $625m to Federal prosecutors and the trustee representing Mr Madoff’s victims, the Financial Times says. The money represents “fictitious” proceeds from their investments with Mr Madoff. The agreement does not allege that Mr Shapiro or his wife was involved in the fraud.
