Maxime Carmignac is “not opposed” to the notion of taking over as head of Carmignac Gestion


In an interview with Das Investment, Maxime Carmignac, daughter of Edouard Carmignac, founder and director of Carmignac Gestion, discusses the question of who will succeed her father. Although Maxime Carmignac points out that at 63 years of age, her father is still “very much in good shape,” the young woman admits that she is “not opposed” to the idea of replacing him, if he were to leave the top spot at the management firm headquartered in Place Vendôme in Paris. “But it’s not that simple. My father has several positions at the business: he is not only head of development strategy for Carmignac Gestion, but is also in charge of investment strategy. So we will have to wait and see if I can replace him in one, two or any of those roles in the future,” Maxime Carmignac explains, pointing out that so far, “nothing has been decided.”
