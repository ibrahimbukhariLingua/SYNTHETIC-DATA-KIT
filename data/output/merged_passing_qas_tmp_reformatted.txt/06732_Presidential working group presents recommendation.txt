Presidential working group presents recommendations for money market funds


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The US presidential working group for financial markets, which is composed of Federal regulators, has presented a report on ways to reduce the vulnerability of money market funds to massive withdrawals by investors, the Wall Street Journal reports. Experts say that a floating NAV could reduce the risk, but they are only moderately enthusiastic about such a reform, since it would involve other risks. Among other measures, the group recommends that some form of insurance be created for subscribers to money market funds; it suggests that large redemptions should be made in kind, and not in cash. Another solution would be to require money market funds with a stable net asset value to reorganize as special-purpose banks.
