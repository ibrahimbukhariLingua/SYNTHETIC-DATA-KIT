Wider range of scenarios to be included in «stress tests»


The international settlement bank (BRI) has implicitly admitted that the current system, known as Basel 2, does not provide an adequate measurement of banks’ capacity to resist crises, La Tribune reports. The institution on Wednesday announced arrangements for “'stress test’ and supervision practices” which include more severe scenarios in stress testing. In the future, the BRI will require that the stress tests must be configured within a “larger environment,” and that the tests must take account of “particular risks,” the newspaper reports. These would include coverage strategies, the cost of liquidity, and teh resistance of complex structured products. Banks were saved from bankruptcy only by government intervention, even at a time when they had sufficient levels of owners’ equity under Basel 2 regulations, a specialist explains. Now, stress tests which include tests of economic, growth rates, unemployement, interest rates, and other scenarios, are being conducted by the US goverment on the 19 largest banks int he US, considered exemplary interms of their methodology. European banks are preparing for similar evaluations.
