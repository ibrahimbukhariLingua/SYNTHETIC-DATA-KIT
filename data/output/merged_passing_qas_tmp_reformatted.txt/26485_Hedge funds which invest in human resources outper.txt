Hedge funds which invest in human resources outperform


Hedge funds which invest in their human resources on average post higher returns than those which pay less attention to it, a new study by Citi Prime Finance finds. “People alpha” is becoming a distinctive element in an increasingly competitive sector. To measure this new form of alpha, Citi Prime Finance studied five criteria: the acquisition of talent, the retention of talent, learning and development and performance management. It finds that the element which makes the difference between the good and bad is retention of talent. To evaluate this aspect, Citi Prime Finance used two crieria: development of the culture of the hedge fund and remuneration. Firms which ranked well in terms of retention of talent also tent to have a good talent acquisition policy. CitiPrime Finance concludes by stating that, like operational alpha at its time (having a professional team in terms of operations and robust infrastructure), “people alpha” is a short-term phenomenon which allows leaders in the market to stand out for a limited period of time.
