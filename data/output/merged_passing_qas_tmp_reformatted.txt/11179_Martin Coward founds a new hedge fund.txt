Martin Coward founds a new hedge fund


The co-founder of the hedge fund Ikos (USD3bn), Martin Coward, is preparing to launch a rival hedge fund, which may further increase tensions with the CEO of the fund, Elena Ambrosiadou, his current wife whom he is in the process of divorcing, the Financial Times reports. Like Ikos, the new fund will use extremely complex software, devised by Coward, to trade on markets worldwide.
