Allianz and TH Real Estate launch a Chinese commercial real estate fund


The Allianz group on 17 November announced that it has signed a partnership with TH Real Estate to create ERES APAC II – China Outlets, a closed real estate fund, denominated in US dollars and dedicated to premium outlet shopping centres in China. The transaction has been executed by Allianz Real Estate, the real estate asset management affiliate of the German insurer. “This operation is an integral part of the strategy at Allianz to allocate about 5% of its global portfolio to the Asia Pacific region,” the group says in a statement. The ERES APAC II – China Outlets fund plans to raise USD750m in capital (EUR640m) to acquire two shopping centres, namely Florentia Village Jingjin (located between Beijing and Tianjin) and Florentia Village Shanghai. Allianz will be the principal investor, and will control 30% of the platform, while the remainder will be controlled by long-term institutional investors, including TH Real Estate on behalf of TIAA. TH Real Estate will act directly as a fund manager. The RDM Asia company, a member of the Italian Fingen group, will manage the properties. The Chinese platform marks an expansion of the relationship between Allianz and TH Real Estate and an extension of their partnership in outlet shopping centres, following similar investments in Europe in 2004 and the United Kingdom in 2008.
