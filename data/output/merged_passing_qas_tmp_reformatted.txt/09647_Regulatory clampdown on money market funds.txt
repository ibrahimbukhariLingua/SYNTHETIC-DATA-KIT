Regulatory clampdown on money market funds


With the Reserve Primary Fund meltdown a recent memory, the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday introduced new regulations which require money market funds to hold more liquid top-rated assets, the Wall Street Journal reports. Money market funds will also be required to publish their net asset value more frequently, while the average duration to maturity of assets in the portfolio will be reduced to 60 days from 90 days currently. This could cut into performance, reducing it by a further 0.10%, says Pete Crane, president of the research firm Crane Data. This is not good news for money market fund management firms, which have already seen redemptions due to low returns. Investors withdrew USD540bn from money market funds in 2009, bringing assets down to USD3.3trn.
