City management has been decimated in the past two years


According to an analysis of official FSA data by IMAS Corporate Advisors, more than 17,000 senior finance personnel in the City have lost their jobs in the past two years, the Sunday Times reports. This means that about 10% of the management at British financial firms have passed through the gauntlet set out by the regulatory authorities. This estimate does not include the thousands of jobs lost in administrative and support functions in the banking sector, and the Centre for Economics and Business Research estimates total job losses in the financial sector at about 48,000. The IMAS study reveals, meanwhile, that recruitments picked up again in fourth quarter 2009, for the first time since the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
