Comgest: Rally on emerging markets has gone too far


Vincent Strauss, director of Asian emerging equities at Comgest, estimates that the stock market rally on emerging markets, which have seen a rise of more than 70% in the past five months, “may have gone too far.” He estimates that investors have returned to emerging markets too quickly since February, and that short-term corrections are to be expected, he has told Citywire.
