CalPERS seeks discounts on management fees


In a long article dedicated to Réal Desrochers, a Canadian who is respsonsible for the private equity investments of the pension fund CalPERS (USD241bn), the Wall Street Journal points out that the veteran of Saudi Arabian Investment Co and CalSTRS has often managed to get prices for his employer less than the usual 1% management commission and lower than the traditional 15% to 20% performance commissions.It doesn’t always work: although Cerberus Capital Management, for example, agreed to give a discount off of its management commission, Leonard Green & Partners and Area Management recently told Desrochers that they would not be offering him a discount. And CalPERS has agreed to pay standard commissions for the new fund from Advent International.
