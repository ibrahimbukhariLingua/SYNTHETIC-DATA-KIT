Institutionals should engage more in responsible investment


A recent analysis by Unctad (“Investment and Enterprise Responsibility Review”) of the 100 largest pension funds in the world, with total assets under management of USD8.6trn, or about EUR6.5trn, reveals that nearly half of the major pension funds publish one or several indicators based on the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI). But the analysis finds no reference to responsible investment by 51 pension funds in the sample, representing 39% of total assets under management. Only 27 funds, with assets representing only 42% of all assets under management, publish four or more indicators.The authors of the study conclude that although the increasing spread of responsible investment is a reality, the fact is that many pension funds still have a long way to go. For this reason, they recommend that all institutional investors should be invited to formulate their position in regards to responsible investment to all parties. “Transparency of practices in terms of responsible investment is essential, not only to reduce imblances between contractual parties, but also to ensure the sustainable development of international markets,” the authors point out.p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }
