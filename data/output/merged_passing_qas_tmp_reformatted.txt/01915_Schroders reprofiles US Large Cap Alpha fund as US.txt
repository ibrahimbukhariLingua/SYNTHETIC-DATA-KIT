Schroders reprofiles US Large Cap Alpha fund as US All Cap


From 1 October, the US Large Cap Alpha sub-fund of the Luxembourg Sicav Schroders ISF has been renamed as Schroder ISF US All Cap. The fund may now invest in US equities of all cap sizes, rather than concentrating on large caps. Management will be provided by Jonathan Armitage, head of US equities, with the assistance of Jenny Jones, head of US small/midcap equities. The allocation will be one third to smidcaps and two thirds large caps, though the fund will retain a bottom-up stock-picking approach. Management commissions for all classes of shares in the fund will also be reduced by 25 basis points (to 1.25% for A class shares, for example), and the risk classification of the fund has been lowered to “moderate” from “high.”
