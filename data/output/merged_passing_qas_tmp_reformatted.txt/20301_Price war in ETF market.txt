Price war in ETF market


Since February, Vanguard has been aggressively lowering its TER rates for its ETFs, which has allowed it to gain market share on the US market. The BÃ¶rsen-Zeitung reports that that the market is now expecting the leader, iShares, to be obliged to lower its prices in retaliation. Smaller producers are withdrawing some of their ETFs from the market, when they do not completely liquidate the activity (as Scottrade is doing with its MocusShares line, or as Russell is considering doing). This will be a cause for concern for European providers too, as Vanguard arrived in May in London with five products.
