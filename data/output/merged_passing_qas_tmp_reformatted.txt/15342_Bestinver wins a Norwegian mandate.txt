Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), the affiliate of the Bank of Norway which manages the country’s sovereign funds, including the Government Pension Fund - Global (GPFG), has granted the Spanish management firm Bestinver Gestión (Acciona group) a mandate to manage a portion of its investments in Spain, which represent a total of EUR5.5bn as of the end of December, Funds People reports, citing Expansión. Meanwhile, NBIM is seeking a local manager to handle its investments in the Spanish savings banks, which will soon debut on the stock markets. It is not yet known whether Bestinver will participate in the bidding in this second call for offers. NBIM had previously managed its Spanish investments internally.
