Legg Mason reorganizes Paris office


Two years after his arrival at the Paris office of Legg Mason, Vincent Passa has been promoted to the position of head of distribution for France and French-speaking Europe for the US management firm. In this role, he will be in charge of fund sales and distribution activities for third-party distributors, including financial intermediaries, asset managers, fund of fund managers, banks and high-end distribution platforms. He will also head the Paris office.The promotion follows an increase in assets at the Paris office over the past two years. France has become Legg Mason’s largest market in continental Europe, where the asset management firm is also present in Germany, Italy, and Spain. In an interview with Newsmanagers, Passa did not wish to comment on total assets under management for the Paris office, but says that the “EUR1bn threshold is soon to be crossed.” This goal may be achieved in 2011.To continue this development, Passa will recruit two sales staff. One of them will handle French institutional clients, a segment in which Legg Mason is not yet present, and wishes to actively develop. The recruitment process for the two positions is at an advanced stage, and the announcement of the winners will be coming soon. The team will also include a sales assistant, who started on Monday at the Paris office of Legg Mason.Meanwhile, the product range available to French investors has grown, particularly in the absolute return segment, with a Permal product, and soon, a bond product from Western Asset Management. Legg Mason will be more actively promoting the Legg Mason Capital Management Opportunity Fund, managed with the same management principles as the fund by Bill Miller, but without constraint in terms of cap sizes, sectors and asset classes, although it remains highly focused on US equities.
