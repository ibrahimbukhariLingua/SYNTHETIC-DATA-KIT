Lyxor and JPMorgan team up in risk factor ETFs


Lyxor is adding to its smart beta ETF range, by engaging the services of a prestigious partner. On Wednesday, 17 June, Lyxor ETF, the second-largest issuer in Europe, with nearly EUR50bn in assets, announced that it has signed a partnership with JPMorgan to launch a new range of risk factor ETFs.As part of the launch of the new funds, Lyxor ETF will rely on smart beta indices developed by the «Investible Indices» activity at JPMorgan. “This is a range of smart beta ETFs based on risk factors for European equities,” François Millet, head of ETF and index-based product development at Lyxor, tells Newsmanagers. “We are launching five ‘single factor’ ETFs, with the factors selected being ‘value,’ ‘low size,’ which includes midcap, ‘quality,’ ‘low beta’ and ‘momentum.’ These new ETFs will be listed in July, but the products are already licensed and have passports for the major European countries,” Millet says.This cooperation with JPMorgan does not come about by change, as the US bank is “known for its ability to design smart beta indices,” Millet notes. Additionally, “JPMorgan shares our vision and our definition of risk factor ETFs, with the same regional vision and concentration of risk factors,” Millet adds. “Additionally, JPMorgan has very simple rules for the construction of these indices, with a consistent investment universe. This simplicity and consistency in the construction rules for indices are key elements for ETFs.”Lyxor is a fervent militant for allocation based on a risk factor approach. The French asset management firm may not stop there. “We are leaving the door open to a range of multi-factor ETFs as a second phase,” Millet concludes.
