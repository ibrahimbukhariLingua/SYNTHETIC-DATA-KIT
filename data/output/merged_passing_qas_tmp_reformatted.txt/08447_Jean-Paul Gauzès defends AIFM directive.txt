Jean-Paul Gauzès defends AIFM directive


Jean-Paul Gauzès, the French MEP, insists that most hedge funds and private equity groups have little to fear from the AIFM directive. He insists that the aim of the law on alternative investment fund managers is to eradicate the excesses of these industries, not to drive them out of Europe. “We want to avoid activities that are purely speculative and have no economic or social benefit, such as naked short selling,” he said to the Financial Times.
