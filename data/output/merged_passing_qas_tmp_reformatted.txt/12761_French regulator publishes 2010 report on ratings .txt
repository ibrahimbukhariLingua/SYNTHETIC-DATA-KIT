French regulator publishes 2010 report on ratings agencies


The French financial market regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) on 19 August published its seventh annual report on ratings agencies, which covers international regulatory developments, registration procedures for agencies, and credit ratings. In terms of registration of agencies, the report notes that on 7 September 2010, the deadline for submission of registration applications for existing agencies, 45 entities had submitted an application in Europe. So far, five agencies have been registered: four by the German regulator, and one by the Bulgarian regulator. The AMF is currently participating in sessions of the college of regulators on the subject of the three major ratings agencies, Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch Rating, as part of a registration procedure for the French affiliates of these agencies. The AMF also issued a certification to the Japanese agency Japan Credit Rating Agency (JCRA) on 6 Ajnuary 2011. The French authority was the only competent authority to do so under the certification procedure, as the only member of the college of regulators at JCRA. The AMF says that with the passage and entry into force of the revised Agencies regulations, the European securities markets authority (ESMA) will take on ratings agencies as a primary area of supervision. Its powers will be considerably extended, and gradually, the AMF, along with the other national authorities, will be relieved of its direct responsibility, once the current registratoins are completed, as these powers will be transferred to the AMF. The transfer of responsibility has already come into effect from 1 July for agencies which are already registered or certified, and for all new applications for registration from that date onward.
