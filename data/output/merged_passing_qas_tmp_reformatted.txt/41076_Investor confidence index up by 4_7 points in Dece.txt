Investor confidence index up by 4.7 points in December


The global investor confidence index published by State Street Global Exchange has increased by 4.7 points in December, to finish the year at 95.9 compared with a level of 91.2 (in corrected data) in November. This improvement is the result of a slight increase in investor confidence in the United States, from 89.2 to 90.2, and a significant rise in confidence in Europe, from 101.0 (corrected figures) last month to 107.1 in December. For tis part, the investor confidence index in Asia is down slightly, to 98.5, from 99.3 in November, as economic growth in the region has been the subject of increased concern. “The ongoing progress of fundamental economic data in the United States, especially in the area of employment, finally appear to have won over investor sentiment concerning the ‘tapering’ policy to gradually reduce bond repurchases by the Fed,” says Harvard professor Ken Froot. “It is not rare for high-risk assets to be negatively affected by good economic data, at a wime when investors are concerned about the future of quantitative easing policies and the beginning of ‘tapering.’ The Us Federal Reserve has finally convinced investors to its own interpretation, by which the economy may recover without such radical support measures. With this in mind, investors are accepting an increase in interest rates as an inevitable but bearable consequence of more solid growth, instead of seeing in it evidence of increased constraints on market liquidity and a looming collapse of growth.”
