Neuflize OBCI outsources management of one of its funds to Verrazzano Capital


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } In order to outsource its management, Neuflize OBC Investissements (NOI) has added a well-known asset manager as a feather in its cap. The firm, led by Stéphane Corsaletti, will this morning announce the outsourcing to Verrazzano Capital, and its founder and star manager Guillaume Rambourg, of the management of a European long/short absolute return fund: Neuflize Europe Long Short. As part of the agreement, NOI will also be the exclusive distributor of this strategy on the French market. The fund is not a new creation, insofar as it had initially been a market neutral fund managed internally at NOI since 2007. “However, this type of strategy is less attractive today,” Corsaletti tells Newsmanagers, “and we took the decision to outsource its management to a third-party company which is able to give it a more marked directional bias, better adapted to the present situation:” in other words, a fund which takes into account the better orientation of the equity marktes, and offers controled volatility to investors. In detail, the manager of the Neuflize Europe Long Short fund will carry out active management of long and short positions on equities from companies listed in Europe, and will be able to partially or totally hedge potential residual exposure to market risk. The fund, which is eligible for investment from PEA policies, and meets UCITS 4 standards, also gives itself a larger margin than previously for market exposure (-10% to +40% net exposure), for a maximal annual target volatility of 10%.
