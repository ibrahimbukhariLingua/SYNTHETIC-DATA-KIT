Investors may soon return to high-risk assets


The start of 2019 follows on the end of 2018. Aversion to risk remains at exceptional levels, but many signals point out that the horizon may break soon. In the latest study published by Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research, entitled “Time to Buy,” analysts note that the “Bull & Bear” indicator, which indicates signals of entry or exit points for high-risk asset markets, is in a buy zone for the first time since June 2016, just after the market upset related to the British referendum in favour of exiting from the European Union. According to a Handelsblatt survey dated 7 January, slightly over 3,300 investors interviewed by the newspaper are expecting the DAX index to rise by 10% to 11% this year, while the 30 analysts and economists interviewed by the newspaper are predicting gains of 12,053 points for the German flagship index, a rise of over 14%. In other words, 2019 may hold positive surprises in store. The level of defiance of equities has never been so high, and record divestment in the past few weeks suggest that the stability limit may be near. Meanwhile, the great cleaning continues. In the week ending on 2 January, equity funds saw net outflows of USD21.1bn, according to the weekly study, based on data from the global flow monitoring specialist EPFR Global. These divestments did not lead to a turnover of assets to bond funds, which saw further redemptions, totalling nearly USD8bn. Money market funds, however, attracted over USD50bn. In 2018 overall, funds dedicated to equities on developed markets posted net inflows of slightly under USD50bn, more than four times less than in 2017 (USD211.8bn), according to statistics from EPFR Global, due to outflows of over USD98bn in fourth quarter. European equity funds alone show outflows of USD88.8bn in 2018, though they had brought in USD33.2bn the previous year. However, funds specialised in Japanese equities have attracted USD66.3bn, compared with USD45.2bn in 2017. Equity funds have seen net outflows of USD101.74bn in the year, more than three times more than in the previous year. Emerging market equity funds held out well, with net inflows of USD70.5bn for the year overall, compared with USD84.7bn in 2017. Asia ex Japan equity funds attracted over USD53bn, more than twice as much as the previous year. Chinese equity funds, which saw net outflows of USD3.4bn in 2017, brought in nearly USD35bn last year. Bond funds in all regions combined posted net ouflows of nearly USD150bn in fourth quarter, while for the year overall, outflows exceed USD50bn, though the year 2017 ended with record net inflows of USD611.7bn. Funds dedicated to European equities show net redemptions of USD40.65bn for the year, after net inflows of USD25bn in 2017. However, in the week to 2 January, European bond funds show positive net inflows.
