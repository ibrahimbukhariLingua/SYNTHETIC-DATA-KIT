Aberdeen AM reopens British real estate funds


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Scottish asset management firm Aberdeen Asset Management has announced that as planned, it has lifted its suspension on operations for its Aberdeen UK Property Fund and Aberdeen UK Property Feeder Unit Trust. The suspension had been put in place on 6 July, and was extended twice, until 13 July at noon. The asset management firm in this way intended to confront exceptional market conditions observed in the real estate sector following the referendum on the European Union. Now that the suspension is lifted, “investors can now send their orders.” However, Aberdeen is maintaining its 17% reduction on the value of the fund.
