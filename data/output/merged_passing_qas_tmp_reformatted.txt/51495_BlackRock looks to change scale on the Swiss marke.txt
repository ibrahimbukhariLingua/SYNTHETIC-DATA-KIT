BlackRock looks to change scale on the Swiss market


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } BlackRock does not want to remain boxed into its role as a distributor of funds on the Swiss market. The US group, whose assets under management total nearly USD5trn, would also like to position itself as a provider of financial services, the specialist website finews reports. With this in mind, BlackRock is seeking cooperation with banks, specialists in financial technologies and asset managers in Switzerland. “The objective is not to be only a provider of products but also a provider of services,” Sven Wuerttemberger, head of iShares for German-speaking Switzerland, explained to finews. Recently, BlackRock has recruited Philip Vasan, formerly of Credit Suisse, to provide custom solutions to private banks and independent asset management firms. Stadler will do the same thing at iShares for the Swiss market with a team of four people, which will be reinforced.
