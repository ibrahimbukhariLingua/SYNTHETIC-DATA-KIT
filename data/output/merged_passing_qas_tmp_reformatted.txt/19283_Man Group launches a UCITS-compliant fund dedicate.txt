Man Group launches a UCITS-compliant fund dedicated to commodities


The alternative management specialist Man Group on 3 October announced the launch of the Man Commodities Fund (ISIN code: IE00B3WCY689), a fund which allows private and institutional investors to expose themselves to global commodity markets, in a UCITS-compliant structure. The underlying investment strategy was designed by Man Systematic Strategies, a management entity of the Man group, for investors seeking to diversify their portfolios and not to limit themselves to equities and bonds any longer. With USD50m in assets at launch, the fund is actively managed, and its objective is to outperform passive management indices while minimising the risk of losses. To achieve that, it will adopt a long-only, liquid exposure to the Man Systematic Commodity index, a proprietary index based on 25 liquid futures contracts on precious metals, industrial metals, energies and agricultural products. The investment strategy is designed by Scott Kerson, the new head of commodities at Man Systematic Strategies, who has 17 years of experience in commodities and systematic trading. It will also benefit from the research and contribution of Campbell Harvey, professor of international commerce and J. Paul Sticht chair at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University, and editor in chief of the Journal of Finance. The fund will be released in several European countries, and will require a minimal investment of USD/EUR/GBP/CHF1,000 from private investors, and USD/EUR/GBP/CHF100,000 from institutional investors.
