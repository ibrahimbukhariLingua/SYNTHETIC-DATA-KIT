EME funds post first outflows since September


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In the final days of February, Italian elections brought fears that the euro zone debt crisis would return to the foreground, to such an extent that investors put the brakes on their equity purchases. In the weeek ending on 27 February, emerging market equity funds underwent redemptions for the first time since the beginning of September, according to estimates from EPFR Global.The research agency has also observed record outflows from gold funds, which are generally a sign of a rise in appetite for risk. However, in light of the scale of the redemptions (about USD4bn), EPFR Global estimates that this is rather a short-selling operation, amid rising volatility, rumours of currency wars, and concerns about the euro zone.Certain asset classes, however, have continued to rise. Global equity funds once again finished the week with gains, and inflows for the past ten weeks of USD38.8bn. Diversified funds have posted additional net inflows of over USD1bn for the seventh time in the eight weeks since the beginning of the year.
