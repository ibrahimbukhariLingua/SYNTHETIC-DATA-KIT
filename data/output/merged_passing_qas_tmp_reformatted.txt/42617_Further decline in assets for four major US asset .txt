p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The months are following quick upon one another for AllianceBernstein (AB), Franklin Templeton, Invesco and Legg Maosn. After a complicated month in August, these four players have once again seen a steep decline in their assets under management in September. The steepest decline was at Franklin Templeton, where in one month, assets declined 4.3%, or USD35bn. Assets under management total USD770.9bn as of 30 September 2015, compared with USD806bn as of 31 August 2015. Between 30 June 2015 and 30 September 2015, assets under management fell from USD866.5bn as of the end of June to USD770.9bn as of the end of September, for USD95.6bn in less than one quarter. Invesco has seen a decline of 2.7% to its assets under management in one month. Assets totalled USD755.8bn as of the end of September, compared with USD776.4bn as of the end of August, and USD803.6bn as of the end of June 2015. In September, the decline in assets is largely due to negative market effects, net outflows from long-term products, and a negative currency effect. Currency effect alone resulted in a decline in assets under management of about USD1.7bn. At AllianceBernstein, in one month, assets under management fell 1.7%, to USD463bn as of the end of September, compared with USD471bn as of the end of August. This decline is largely the result of a negative market effect and net outflows to institutional investors. Meanwhile, net inflows from retail and private wealth clients were flat in the past month. Legg Mason has had the same difficulties as its counterparts, with assets down 1.4% to USD672.1bn as of 30 September, comapefd with USD681.9bn as of 31 August. The asset management firm, however, proudly claims net inflows of USD1.5bn to long-term products. However, Legg Mason has seen USD1.1bn in net redemptions from liquidity products. Meanwhile, negative currency effects have led to a decline in assets of about USD1.2bn.
