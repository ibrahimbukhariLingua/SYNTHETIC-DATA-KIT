Warburg acquires 80% of Private Client Partners


The German group M.M. Warburg & Co KGaA on Monday announced the acquisition of an 80% stake in the Zurich-based Family Office Bank Private Client Partners AG, in which a 20% stake continues for the moment to be controlled by the founder and CEO, Andreas Bodemann. Warburg has an option to later increase its participation to 100%. The operation will allow the German private bank to build its presence in the family office market, a sector of activity in which it began in 1998, and since concentrated in its Hamburg-based affiliate Marcard, Stein & Co. Private Clients Partners will retain its operational independence. The acquisition price has not been revealed.
