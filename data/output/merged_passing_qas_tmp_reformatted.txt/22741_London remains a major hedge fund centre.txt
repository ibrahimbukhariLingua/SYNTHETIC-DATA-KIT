London remains a major hedge fund centre


London remains the largest centre for hedge fund managers outside the United States, with 57 firms managing at least USD1bn each (not counting the London offices of the 100 main US hedge fund firms), Financial Times Fund Management reports, citing figures from HedgeFundIntelligence. An increase in taxes and regulations does not appear to have driven hedge fund managers away.
