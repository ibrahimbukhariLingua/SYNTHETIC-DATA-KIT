BNP Paribas AM modifies two sub-funds of its Luxembourg Sicav


BNP Paribas Asset Management (BNPP AM) has decided to profoundly modify two sub-funds of its Luxembourg Sicav BNP Paribas L1. In a letter to shareholders dated 27 November, the asset management firm announced that the Diversified World Balanced and Diversified World Growth sub-funds will change names from 29 December 2017, to become ‘Sustainable Active Balanced’ and ‘Sustainable Active Growth,’ respectively. “Demand for profiled funds is increasing. Meanwhile, demand for SRI products by our main clients has been increasing steadily. We are therefore offering shareholders a way to capitalise on the success of the strategy of the ‘Sustainable Active’ sub-fund,” BNPP AM explains in the letter.Consequently, the two sub-funds will now follow a socially responsible investment (SRI) strategy, “which is not the case for the current investment policy,” the asset management firm says. Though these sub-funds may now place up to 40% of their assets in alternative investments, this possibility will not exist after the transformation. Another notable change is that each sub-fund will have exposure of at least 50% to fixed income, BNPP AM States. Each sub-fund will now invest directly or indirectly (via an OPCVM, OPC and/or ETF vehicle) in bonds or equities from issuers who satisfy sustainable development criteria which inculde environmental and social responsibility as well as corporate governance (SRI criteria), applying an SRI filter, and derivative financial instruments for these types of assets, the asset management firm says.
