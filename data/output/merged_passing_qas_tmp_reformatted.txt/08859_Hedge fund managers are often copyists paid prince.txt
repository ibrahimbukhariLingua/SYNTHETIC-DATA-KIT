Hedge fund managers are often copyists paid princely sums


In a study of 8,650 funds on sale in Germany, the wealth management firm Gecam has found that 2009 was a good year in terms of performance, but that managers are not responsible for much of it, Die Welt am Sonntag reports. Nearly half of German equities funds outperformed the MSCI Germany, compared with 30% in 2008; for global equities, the percentage of funds which outperformed their benchmarks rose from 36% to 41%, while the percentage has more than doubled for North American equities funds, from 165 to 35%. However, the percentage of emerging markets equities funds which outperformed their benchmark has fallen to 22% from 23%. To better judge the results, Gecam has added a measure of correlation. It came in at 0.97 for German equities funds in 2009, compared with 0.94 over the past three years, which shows that managers have become even more passive and are now content to follow the index for 97% of their investments. The correlation and performance of larger funds is naturally respectively higher, and weaker, than those of smaller funds, which are more easily maneuverable. This high level of correlation raises questions about whether it is genuinely worth paying at least 2% in management commissions per year, rather than investing in a tracker fund for considerably less money.
