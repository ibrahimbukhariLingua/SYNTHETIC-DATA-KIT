Institutional investors set to increase exposure to alternative credit, according to a research by NN IP


New research* from NN Investment Partners (NN IP) reveals institutional investors plan to increase their exposure to alternative credit this year as an expected increase in interest rates will create challenges for traditional fixed income asset classes. Alternative credit is an increasingly important asset class consisting of a range of loans to companies, organisations and projects outside of the regulated banking system. NN IP’s ‘Investor Sentiment: Alternative Credit’ research, reveals 94% of investors expect the Federal Rate will rise over the next 12 months - 61% anticipate an increase of 0.5% or more. Also, 69% believe that quantitative easing in Europe will end by 2019 and there will be controlled rate rises. If this happens, 37% of investors say they would increase their exposure to alternative credit, higher than any other fixed income asset class.Over the next 12 months, 14% of institutional investors anticipate they will start investing in alternative credit for the first time, and 45% who already invest in this asset class intend to increase their exposure. Key obstacles to investing in alternative credit include understanding the risk profile, and a lack of relevant data and information, said the authors.
