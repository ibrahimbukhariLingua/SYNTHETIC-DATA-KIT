p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } FTSE Russell has announced that it has added to its factor product range, the FTSE Global Factor Index Series, with the inclusion of two additional factors, momentum and dividend yield. The new range responds to a demand manifested by clients for tools to allow them to target specific factors to define and explain equity risk/return grids. The factoral indices included in the product range at FTSE Russell covers both developed and emerging markets. FTSE Russell also offers multi-factoral indices, and uses a special “tilt-tilt” method to improve exposure to multiple factors.
