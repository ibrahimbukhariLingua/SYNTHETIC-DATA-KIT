New proposals for hedge fund directive


Jean-Paul Gauzes, the MEP responsible for steering the AIFM directive through the EU’s parliamentary process, has proposed a “two-tier” approach to the registration of non-EU funds, says the Financial Times. Non-EU managers looking to market in the EU would be able to obtain a “passport” to do so throughout the bloc if they agreed to comply with the EU’s new rules on registration, leverage and so on. This would have to be backed by an agreement with their home country market regulator, adds the newspaper.
