Index-based management gains momentum in Sweden


In 2013, Swedish index-based equity funds represented more than SEK140bn (EUR15.5bn), or 11% of total equity funds on sale in Sweden, compared with less than SEK20bn in 2001 (EUR2.2bn), or 3%, a report by the Swedish fund management association of passive and active management has found. This gain in popularity for index-based management has been driven by strong inflows to these products. Since 2010, equity tracker funds have posted net inflows of SEK47bn (EUR5.2bn), while at the same time, actively-managed equity funds have seen outflows of SEK3bn (EUR0.3bn). The report by Fondbolagens FÃ¶rening, available in Swedish on their website, describes the two types of management.
