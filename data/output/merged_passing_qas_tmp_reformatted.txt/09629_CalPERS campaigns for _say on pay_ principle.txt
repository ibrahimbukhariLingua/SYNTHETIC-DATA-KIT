CalPERS campaigns for “say on pay” principle


The California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) on 28 January announced that it has signed an open letter which calls on financial establishments to hold a consultative vote of shareholders on management pay scales (“say on pay.”) 30 investors have co-signed the letter, addressed to 17 financial institutions who are called on to apply the “say on pay” principle, which is considered indispensable for good corporate governance. From this standpoint, “we congratulate Goldman Sachs, State Street and Bank of New York for showing the way,” says Joseph Dear, CIO of CalPERS, in a statement.
