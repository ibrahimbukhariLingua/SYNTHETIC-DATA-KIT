The managers will invest in municipal and corporate bonds in sectors which have positive impacts in social and environmental terms. The strategy, managed by James Dearborn, Chad Farrington and Thomas Murphy, benefits from the collaboration of the research office Sustainalytics for the development of an in-house model for the evaluation of social impact.
