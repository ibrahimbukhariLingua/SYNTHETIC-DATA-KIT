Head of db x-trackers responds to criticisms


In an interview with Financial Times Fund Management, Thorsten Michalik, global head of db x-trackers, responds to current criticism of ETF funds. He regrets that ETFs are being stigmatised, and claims that most of the problems that have been identified by regulators, including the use of derivatives, are widespread practices for many other financial products sold to retail clients. Michalik opposes the establishment of restrictions on sales of synthetic ETFs to retail clients; this may also be partly due to the fact that db X-trackers is beginning to offer such products in Germany, via a partnership with DAB Bank, by the terms of which the management firm will offer no-fee ETF trades for regular savings investors.
