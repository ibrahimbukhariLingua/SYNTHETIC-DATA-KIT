AGEFI AMtech Day&nbsp;: Large internet players worry asset management firms


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } The announced arrival of internet giants in the asset management industry is the subject of real concern among asset management firms, and for good reason. While Google is reported to have commissioned a vast study nearly two years ago to help it make its entry into the market (see Newsmanagers of 29 September 2014), the Chinese firm Alibaba has already shown its strength with inflows of CNY574bn (about EUR75bn) to the money market fund Yu’e Bao. The Chinese e-commerce giant is now planning to sell the fund in Hong Kong. “Alibaba, which has posted money market inflows of about EUR80bn, represents a threat,” Charlotte Dennery, chief operating officer and a member of the executive board at BNP Paribas Investment partners, admitted at a round table held as part of the 5th AGEFI AMtech Day. “This is a disruption to the industry that makes us think.” The challenge is all the more crucial as asset management firms are only at the beginning of their digital projects.
