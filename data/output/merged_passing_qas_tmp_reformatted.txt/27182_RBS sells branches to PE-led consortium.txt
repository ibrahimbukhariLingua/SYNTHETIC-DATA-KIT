RBS sells branches to PE-led consortium


The British RBS group has finally sold off branches of the Williams & Glyn’s bank to a consortium led by the private equity groups Corsair Capital and Centrebridge partners, Investment Week reports. The competing consortium of asset management firms including Schroders and Threadneedle, has thus failed in its bid to take over the 314 bank branches, which have been sold for a total of GBP600m. The winning consortium, which also includes the Church Commissioners for England and RIT Capital Partners, will buy a minority stae in Williams & Glyn’s following the listing of its activities in the next few months. RBS will sell its branches by 2014 as part of a restructuring plan required by the European Commission in exchange for a bailout of the banking group.
