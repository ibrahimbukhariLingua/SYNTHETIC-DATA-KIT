Launch of DAXglobal Urbanization fund


Since 17 March, Deutsche Börse has been offering the DAXglobal China Urbanization index, which covers the 20 largest and most liquid caps from five sectoral DAXglobal indices. The companies must be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (either as H-shares or Red Chips), or on the Singapore Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, or the Nasdaq. The objective is to bring investors exposure to strong growth in Chinese cities, whose populations are growing by about 13 million people per year. The challenge presented by such dynamic urbanization imply investments in infrastructure, for example, in an increase in housing aupply and the development of urban transport systems, both growth sectors which are included in the new index. The Deutsche Börse states that since 15 March there has been a product from Vontobel based on the Euro-denominated version of the DAXglobal China Urbanization Index, which is available in three currencies (Swiss francs, Euros, and US dollars), in two versions each (PR and TR, for performance and total return).
