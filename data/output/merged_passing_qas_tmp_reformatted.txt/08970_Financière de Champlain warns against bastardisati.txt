Financière de Champlain warns against bastardisation of SRI process


At a time of growing demand for socially responsible investment (SRI) products by institutional as well as retail investors, asset management firms are stepping up their efforts to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into their traditional management. Though the development may be welcome news, Financière de Champlain, an asset manager specialised in sustainable management, warns of the dangers of SRI funds becoming too commonplace. “One of the approaches used by asset management compnaies for SRI integration is to use analysis undertaken for their SRI funds to set up ratings of traditional equities portfolios partly composed of the same shares,” the firm explains in a note. This type of analysis is known as “ex post.” Financière de Champlain claims that it “is not, fundamentally, based on a stock-picking process on the basis of extra-financial criteria.” Even though ESG integration practices make extra-financial information available to managers which could allow them to identify new risks, “they do not constrain the manager,” the asset management firm states. “The danger is thus high that this might create some confusion in the minds of retail investors between management firms which are genuinely in the process of converting their product ranges to SRI, and others who see the trend as an opportunity to paint themselves green,” Financière de Champlain concludes.
