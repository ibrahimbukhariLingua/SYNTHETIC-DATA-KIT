Half of fund selectors would not recommend a fund which they donâ€™t personally like


Should fund selector recommend to clients to invest in a fund in which they would not personally place their own money? That question was posed by the most recent Citywire Global survey, published on Monday, and it divides fund selectors surveyed, with 52% of 109 respondents saying that once all the tests and due diligence has been conducted, they would not recommend a fund in which they would not invest themselves, while 48% would recommend such a fund nonetheless, mostly because their wealth management needs may be different to those of their clients.
