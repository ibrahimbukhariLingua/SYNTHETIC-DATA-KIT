Investors seek safety in US equities


At a time when Europe is confronting unprecedented turbulence, investors have sought refuge in US equities, according to the most recent edition of the BofA Merrill Lynch survey of 202 managers with USD530bn in assets, undertaken between 7 and 13 May. International investors, who retain their confidence in the US dollar, are preferring US equities. The percentage of investors who are overweight in global equities has fallen to a net total of 30%, compared with 52% in April, but the United States are now investors’ region of choice, as 66% predict that the US dollar will be the reserve currency most likely to gain the most value in the next few months. The difference between investors’ predictions of profit outlooks in Europe and the United States has reached a seven-year high. Investors’ concerns were not limited to Europe, but also applied to emerging markets. The number of investors predicting a rise in global growth in the next twelve months fell to 42%, compared with 61% in April. The same was true of profits, with only 47% of respondents predicting an improvement, compared with 67% the previous month. Expectations for emerging markets have fallen, but it is Europe most of all which investors are moving away from. 46% predict a depreciation of the Euro, twice as many as the previous month, and 30% are planning to go underweight in Europe, compared with 13% in April.
