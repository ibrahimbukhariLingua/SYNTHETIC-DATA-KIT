Aberdeen AM changes heads in Spain


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Aberdeen Asset Management has announced the appointment of Ana Guzman as country head for Spain and head of development for its activity on the Iberian peninsula, Funds People reports. In her new role, Guzman will be primarily responsible for implementing the groupâ€™s strategy on the Spanish market. Since the Spanish office of Aberdeen was opened in October 2013, Guzman had served as senior head of development, alongside Alvaro Anton, who had served in the same position. Anton will get a large promotion, and will now become responsible for coordinating the development of Aberdeen AM in the area of alternative products in Switzerland and Southern Europe, the Spanish news website says. Anton will, however, retain his current responsibilities concerning the development of Aberdeen AM in Spain. The Spanish office of Aberdeen, opened in late 2013, now has 5 employees.
