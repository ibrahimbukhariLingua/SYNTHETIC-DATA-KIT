Edram’s ex boss to launch a consulting firm


According to reports received by Newsmanagers, Philippe Couvrecelle is preparing to launch a consulting firm with a former employee of Edram, the asset management firm of the Compagnie Financière Edmond de Rothschild which he led for five years. Couvrecelle, who left Edram in August this year, would now like to put the experience he acquired in the collective management world to use. Via his firm, which will be known as PTH Conseil, the head will serve not only French businesses with reflections on the transformation of their asset management activities, development, and future, but also foreign asset management firms seeking to gain a foothold in Europe. Couvrecelle, who has worked for major groups and family-owned businesses, has also opened international offices and has good knowledge of the challenges to come. He is entering a market in crisis in which questions of strategy are increasingly present. According to information obtained by Newsmanagers, the professional is also planning to serve US and Asian investment firms which are aiming to establish a presence in Europe, such as GCS, which has recently entered exclusive negotiations with the Dexia group to take over Dexia AM. In light of the currently attractive valuations, investment funds are also a target for PTH Conseil. Lastly, Couvrecelle is also expected to approach firms whose objective is to profit from savings reserves in emerging markets and capital managed by pension funds, such as Chilean funds.
