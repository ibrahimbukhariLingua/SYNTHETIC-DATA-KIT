On the other side of the table alternative UCITS funds (+EUR1.1 bn) saw the highest net inflows, followed by real estate products (+EUR0.6 bn) and commodity funds (+EUR0.3 bn). Money market funds, for their part, enjoyed net inflows of EUR2.8bn.BlackRock, with net sales of EUR5.4 bn, was the best selling individual long-term fund for February, ahead of Generali (+EUR2.9 bn) and Legal & General (+EUR2.7 bn).Lastly, the rankings of the best funds in Europe in February were dominated by MMA II – European Credit BI (CHF Hedged), followed by Schroder ISF European Alpha Abs Return A Acc et UBS (CH) Inst Fd – Bonds CHF Inland U-X.
