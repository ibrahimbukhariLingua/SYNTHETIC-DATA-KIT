Fidelity asks businesses to modify their compensation policies


The asset management firm Fidelity Worldwide Investment is warning 400 businesses in which it invests that they need to reform their compensation policy, the Financial Times reports. If they do not do it, businesses will be required to face a vote against their pay scales at general shareholdersâ€™ meetings. In particular, Fidelity would like businesses to increase the period for which executives hold shares in the firm from three years to five years before they are allowed to sell them. This is intended to encourage them to work for the long term.
