BNP Paribas warns clients of risk of loss of capital in a money market fund


BNP Paribas is warning its clients of the risk of capital losses from an employee savings money market fund. In a letter sent to clients on 15 September, which NewsManagers has seen, BNP Paribas Epargne Retraite et Entreprises announces a new name for “Multipar Sécurité Plus,” which becomes “Multipar Monétaire Sélection” from 3 October 2016. The firm, which states that the mode of management will remain the same, cites two reasons for the change. On the one hand, “money market investments no longer render it possible to preserve capital: previously, money markets allied reasonable performance and limitation of the risk of capital losses. They now have slightly but sustainably negative returns, due to the policies implemented by the European Central Bank to support the economy,” the letter says. Meanwhile, in light of this new situation, “the term ‘sécurité' may cause confusion following developments on the money markets. We have chosen to change it for better legibility,” the letter explains.The bank also explains that money market investments are “more than ever” very short-term investments, “but slightly destructive of capital.”According to the company’s website, the Multipar Sécurité Plus fund, launched in February 2007, shows performance of zero since the beginning of the year, and 0.001% over a rolling one-year period. Its net asset value is EUR569.5m.
