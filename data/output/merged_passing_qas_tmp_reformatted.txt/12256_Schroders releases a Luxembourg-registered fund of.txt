Schroders releases a Luxembourg-registered fund of Brazilian equities


Starting from the assumption that “a growing number of investors consider Brazilian equities an asset class unto themselves, rather than as a subcategory of emerging markets,” as Philippe Lecomte, CEO for France, puts it, Schroders is now releasing the Brazilian equities sub-fund of its Luxembourg Sicav Schroder International Selection Fund (SISF) for sale in France. The fund includes 20-40 positions, with the MSCI Brazil 10/40 as its benchmark. Carlos Scretas uses a strategy combining top-down analysis of the market with bottom-up stock-picking, to select high quality shares which offer both attractive valuations and strong exposure of revenues to domestic growth. Like other major management firms, Schroders has some legitimacy in this investment theme. The British group has been active in the management and selection of equities on the Brazilian market for more than 17 years. Its local team, composed of 16 investment specialists, manages portfolios of Brazilian equities with a total value of over USD1.8bn as of 31 March 2011.
