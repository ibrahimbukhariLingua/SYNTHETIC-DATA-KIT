Thomson Reuters launches islamic inter-bank benchmark rate


The Islamic Interbank Benchmark Rate (IIBR), being offered by Thomson Reuters from 22 November, offers Islamic banks which are committed to respecting Sharia a benchmark index which may replace conventional benchmarks such as the Libor, which they have relied on in the past due to a lack of an equivalent tool, the BÃ¶rsen-Zeitung reports.Because the IIBR complies with Islamic law, it measures not interest rates but rather gains. The index will be calculated on a daily basis on the basis of data from 16 Islamic banks and Islamic banking departments at conventional banks. It will be published daily at 11:00 AM, Mecca time (GMT +3).
