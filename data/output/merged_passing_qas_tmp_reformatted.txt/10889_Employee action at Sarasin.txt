Employee action at Sarasin


Amidst rumours that the Dutch firm Rabobank was planning to sell off its 46% stake in the capital of Banque Sarasin (with 69% voting rights), the employees of the latter firm have begun to mobilise. Hundreds have attended video-conferences on sites in Basel, Zurich, Geneva, Lugano, Bern and Lucerne. The employees, fearing for their jobs, are hoping to avoid an acquisition by Julius Baer or the Raiffeisen group. According to a statement from the Swiss banking employees’ association (ASEB), employees “have approved a letter to Rabobank, asking it to take into account the long-term interests of clients of Banque Sarasin and the loyalty and engagement of its employees.” The statement from the ASEB adds that “this is also an announcement addressed to institutions that may be interested in acquiring Rabobank’s stake: employees want to continue to work at Banque Sarasin, following the sustainability principles they have embraced. They have mandated their personnel commission and the ASEB to defend their interests.” Banque Sarasin is subject to the labour conditions for banking industry employees, which state that the ASEB may intervene at the request of employee representatives.
