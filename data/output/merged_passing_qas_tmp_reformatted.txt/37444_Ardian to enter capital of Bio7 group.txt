p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } The French private equity group Ardian (formerly Axa Private equity) on Wednesday, 11 June announced that it has signed up to exclusive talks with Chequers Capital and the biologist shareholders in the Bio 7 group, led by Frédéric Barroux, over an entry into the capital of the group as a minority shareholder, replacing Chequers Capital. The latter entered the capital of the Bio 7 group in 2009, in association with the biologist founders and the management of the business. At the multi-site Medi 7, Lab 77 and Lab 78 labs, the Bio 7 group is the leader in routine medical analysis in the French departments of Essonne, Seine et Marne and Yvelines. In 2014, the French group is expecting to earn revenues of over EUR55m, of which more than 95% are for routine biology, for strong growth compared with 2013, Ardian says in a statement. The transaction remains subject to reporting to employee representative bodies and control by regulatory authorities.
