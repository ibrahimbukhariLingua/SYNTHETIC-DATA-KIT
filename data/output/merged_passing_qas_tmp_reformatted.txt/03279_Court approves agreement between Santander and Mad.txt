Court approves agreement between Santander and Madoff trustee


Expansi√≥n reports that the US courts have approved an agreement between Optimal, a management firm of the Santander group, and Irving Picard, the legal administrator in charge of liquidating the Madoff empire. The agreement, reached at the end of May, states that Santander will pay USD235m, which corresponds to the total amount received by the firm in redemptions in the three months before the Madoff fraud was discovered. Picard says that the USD235m corresponds to 85% of what he had initially asked Santander to pay back.
