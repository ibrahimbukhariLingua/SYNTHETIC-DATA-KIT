United Kingdom - MPs put hedge fund managers on the hot seat


On Tuesday, a Parliamentary commission heard testimony from the heads of several alternative management firms, to determine the extent to which they were responsible for the recent banking crisis in the United Kingdom, the Wall Street Journal reports. Among the executives who spoke to the panel were Chris Hohn (TCI), Paul Marshall (Marshall Wace) and Douglas Shaw (BlackRock). The managers defended themselves in the usual way, claiming that they were only seeking to profit from turbulence in the markets, but that they cannot be held responsible for it. Hohn and Marshall also stated that assets at their firms have fallen to USD9.5bn and USD6.6bn, respectively, from about USD15bn each one year ago.
