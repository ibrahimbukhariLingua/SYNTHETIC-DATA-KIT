JPMAM merges two funds


The board of advisors at JPMorgan Investment Funds has decided to abosorb the Europe Select Mega Cap Fund, a sub-fund of its Luxembourg Sicav (EUR9.8m in assets as of the end of February) into the Europe Select Equity Fund, due to the considerable similarities between the processes and management objectives of the two products, and the low level of assets in the Mega Cap. The merger will be undertaken via an exchange of shares on 12 June.
