Tobam concludes a strategic partnership with ChinaAMC


Tobam, Paris-based research driven quantitative asset manager, and China Asset Management Company (ChinaAMC), a Chinese asset manager, announced a strategic partnership to develop a Anti-Benchmark China A-shares equity investment strategy. «The announcement that China’s A Shares will be included in the MSCI Emerging Markets benchmarks by June 1st, 2018 has increased investors’ needs for core strategies in Chinese equities», explain a press release.The Anti-Benchmark China strategies will seek to maximize diversification across the CSI indexes (CSI 300, CSI 500 & CSI 800 universes) by applying TOBAM’s patented Maximum Diversification approach, which is designed to avoid the risk biases that more traditional allocation methods such as market-cap weighting can lead to.ChinaAMC will leverage their expertise and privileged access to the Chinese A-Shares equity markets and complement this with TOBAM’s research capabilities and unique Anti-Benchmark approach.Like in other markets, the implementation of the Maximum Diversification® approach in the China A-Shares equity investment universe aims at delivering the risk premium of the asset class via diversification, which seeks to translate into both excess return and reduced volatility vs. the corresponding market cap-weighted index.
