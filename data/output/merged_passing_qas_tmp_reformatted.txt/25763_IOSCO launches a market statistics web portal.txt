IOSCO launches a market statistics web portal


The International Organization of Securities Commissions on November 28 launched a statistics web portal that provides the public with a global overview of specific securities markets.The objectives of the new portal are threefold. First, it seeks to provide a centralized point for monitoring global trends, risks and vulnerabilities; second, to provide a mechanism for comparison of how well markets are recovering in light of the crisis; and finally, to provide IOSCO members and the broader financial community with easy access to key statistics, charts and indicators on a number of securities markets (corporate debt, covered bonds, securitized products, islamic finance, equity IPO volumes, equity market valuations, syndicated loans and housing price indices).The portal will be updated on a monthly basis.
