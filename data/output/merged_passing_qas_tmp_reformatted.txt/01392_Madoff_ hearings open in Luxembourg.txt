Madoff: hearings open in Luxembourg


Les Echos reports that the first hearings will be held today and tomorrow in a lawsuit that pits clients who lost money in the Luxalpha Sicav, which had ties to the Madoff fraud, against UBS entities which served as the depository, manager, and promoter of the Sicav fund. UBS has previously held out well in legal battles related to the fund, and this is not expected to change drastically. Investorsâ€™ case may ultimately run aground on the question of whether the courts are to recognize their status as shareholders. UBS maintains that only shareholders listed on the Luxalpha register are qualified to bring suit. Some of these registered shareholders are none other than the French financial establishments which served as market-makers and custodians under French law, by which they only hold shares on behalf of their clients, and do not hold the rights of ordinary shareholders under any circumstances. Despite all the efforts of these firms to obtain recognition from the regulators and liquidators responsible for the Luxalpha, they have not been successful in gaining recognition from them as shareholders.
