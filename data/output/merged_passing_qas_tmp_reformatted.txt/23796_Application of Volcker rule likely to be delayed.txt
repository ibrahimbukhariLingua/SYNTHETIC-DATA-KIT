Application of Volcker rule likely to be delayed


Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has told a Congressional committee that the Volcker rule, part of the larger Dodd-Frank reforms, will probably not come into force at the beginning of July as planned, as a market consultation which ran until the end of February has received about 17,000 comments which will need to be analysed, the Financial Times reports. The Dodd-Frank law gives regulators an option to delay the application of the bill for up to two years.
