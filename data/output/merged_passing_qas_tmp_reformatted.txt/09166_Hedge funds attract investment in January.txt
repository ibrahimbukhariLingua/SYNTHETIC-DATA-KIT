Hedge funds attract investment in January


In January, hedge funds attracted an estimated total of USD7.1bn in investment, according to Hedge Week, citing data from Trim Tabs Investment Research and BarclayHedge. This is a development worth noting, as the first month of the year normally involves outflows due to redemptions. Assets in hedge funds totalled USD1.5trn as of the end of January, a 23.6% increase compared with their levels in April 2009. Distressed equities in January saw their largest inflows and best returns (1.8%). Multi-strategy funds, meanwhile, had their largest outflows, while long-only equities earned the most mediocre results.
