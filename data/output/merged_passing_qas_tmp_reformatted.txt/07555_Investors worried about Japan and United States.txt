Investors worried about Japan and United States


Following China and Europe, it is now the turn of Japan and the United States to be the object of investors’ concerns. According to a BofA Merrill Lynch survey undertaken between 6 and 12 August, covering 187 management firms with a total of USD513bn in assets under management, pessimism about the Chinese economy had decreased, with a net 19% negative on outlooks for the evolution of the Chinese economy in the next 12 months, compared with 39% the previous month. This led to an increase in interest in commodities, with 9% of the sample overweight in commodities, compared with 1% underweight in July. There is also positive opinion about the European economy, for this prospects have improved considerably due to a rebound in optimism about the European banking sector. 11% of respondents are not overweight on Euro zone equities, while one month ago, investors were 10% underweight. Investors’ appetite for the Untied States, however, has considerably decreased. 14% of allocartors now underweight US equities, while 7% overweighted them in July. The change is even moer pronounced for Japanese equities, where 27% were underweight in August, compared with 7% previously.
