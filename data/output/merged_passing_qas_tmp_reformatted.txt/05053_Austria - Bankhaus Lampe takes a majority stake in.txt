Austria - Bankhaus Lampe takes a majority stake in DALE Investment Advisors


The German private bank Lampe (Oetker group), which manages about EUR10bn, has announced that it has increased its stake in the Austrian firm DALE Investment Advisors, whose assets under management for 25 high net worth licents represent about EUR1bn. The amount of the transaction has not been disclosed. Lampe bought a minority stake in Lampe at the end of 2007 (see Newsmanagers of 14 December 2007). The objective with the new transaction is to strengthen the German bank’s presence in the management of large family fortunes, ethical investment, and alternative investment. In addition, Austria may serve as a base for an expansion into eastern Europe, says Stephan Schüller, chairman of the board of managing partners at Lampe.
