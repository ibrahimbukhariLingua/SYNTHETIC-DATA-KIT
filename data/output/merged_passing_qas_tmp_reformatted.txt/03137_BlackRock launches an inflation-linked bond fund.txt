BlackRock launches an inflation-linked bond fund


The Luxembourg Sicav BlackRock Global Funds (BGF) from BlackRock since 19 June now has an additional sub-fund. The BGF Global Inflation Linked Bond Fund is aimed at subscribers with a long-term horizon, and will invest primarily in inflation-linked bonds issued anywhere in the world. The new product will be co-managed by Brian Weinstein and Adam Bowman. The fund will be denominated in US dollars, but Euro-hedged shares will be available. The average duration of bonds in the portfolio will be over 7 years, and the benchmark is the Barclays Capital World Inflation-Linked Bond Index (US hedged). Currently, BlackRock manages USD15.2bn in assets (as of the end of March) in index-based bond portfolios on behalf of institutionals, of which USD9.7bn are in mandates.
