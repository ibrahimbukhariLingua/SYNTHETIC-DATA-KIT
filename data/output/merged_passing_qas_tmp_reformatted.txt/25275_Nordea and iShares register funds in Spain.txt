Nordea and iShares register funds in Spain


Funds People reports that Nordea has registered four additional sub-fund of its Nordea 1 Sicav, the Emerging Markets Small Cap Fund, managed by Copper Rock Capital Partners, the Chinese equity Fund, the Unconstrained Bond Fund, managed by MacKay Shields, and the Nordic Corporate Bond Fund (shares hedged in euros). The Spanish regulator has also issued a sales license for the iShares Euro Stoxx 50 ex-Financials UCITS ETF from BlackRock (see Newsmanagers of 17 December). It is the first ETF on the European market with an international (pan-European structure) for securities processing, resulting in a cooperation between BlackRock and Euroclear Bank. Previously, when an ETF had been listed on several European markets, the liquidation occurred at the national central depository corresponding to each market on which the trades were executed.
