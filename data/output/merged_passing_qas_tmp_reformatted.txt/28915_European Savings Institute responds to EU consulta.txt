European Savings Institute responds to EU consultation on long-term financing


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } At its general assembly, held on 13 June 2013, the European Savings Institute (OEE) responded to a consultation by the European Commission on long-term financing for the European economy.The OEE is placing the emphasis on the fact that the primary source of savings is households. To allow for financing in the right economic conditions, it is therefore necessary to put oneself in the place of savings investors, and avoid distortions in taxation or regulations getting in the way of the top priorities in Europe: “preparing for retirement, and protecting themselves against the risks of dependency in old age; diversify portfolios via investments in equities, in all their forms: corporate savings, direct purchases and via intermediated products,” a statement released on 2 July says.The test of the response is available here.
