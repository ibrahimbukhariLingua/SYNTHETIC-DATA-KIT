Performance fees do not guarantee higher returns


On average, 62.1% of absolute return funds on sale in the United Kingdom which charge performance fees delivered positive 12-month rolling returns, which is lower than the percentage of funds which charge no performance fees which have posted positive returns (63.5%), a recent Lipper survey finds.Taking into account the fact that some funds have been in existence longer than others, the result is 67% for funds with performance fees, and 67.5% for funds which do not charge performance commissions.This finding may go to explain why the use of performance commissions by British funds (unit trusts and OEIC) have been on a falling trend since 2004, when the practice was once again allowed.In Lipper’s 2007 survey, 34 funds had adopted a performance fee structure, a number that had risen to 81 funds in our 2010 analysis, a 138% rise that showed a clear acceleration of interest. But the number of funds with these fees today actually stands at 80 – just 3% of the entire UK funds universe. This reflects not only a slowing of funds being launched with performance fees, but also the closure (or merger) of funds and the removal of performance fees. The result is that, while 112 funds had performance commissions at one time or another in their history, the total is currently 28.6% lower than that level.
