Paris Europlace publishes proposals to restart the economy


Ahead of the presidential elections in France, Paris Europlace has issued a white paper describing the essential role of the financial industry in assisting to finance the economy and the indispensable measures to be taken in 2012-2015, including learning the lessons of the financial crisis.The white paper points to the need to orient French savings to long-term investment, conslolidate existing long-term assets, and make higher-risk invesmtents, particularly in equities, be rewarded by a “more tax-favoured savings clause,” developing collective corporate retirement policies (Perco) and instituting a guarantee of fiscal and social stability for long-term savings.The document also insists on the acceleration of developments in sustainable finance in France and Europe.
