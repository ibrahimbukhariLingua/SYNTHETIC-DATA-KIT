Investorsâ€™ appetite for risk back in force


Optimism seems to have returned in full to the investment world. A growing number of investors are anticipating a recovery of the global economy, and a vigorous one at that, according to the most recent survey, undertaken in April, of 197 participating managers, with USD546bn under management, undertaken by BofA Merrill Lynch. The number of investors who are taking higher-than-average risks with their portfolios has returned to its highest level since January 2006. Participants in the survey increasingly expect strong growth combined with low inflation: 32%, compared with 21% in March, have this opinion. Inflationary fears remain highly moderate, and 42% of respondents, compared with 385 the previous month, do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates before 2011. As a result of this rising optimism, a net total of 52% of respondents are overweight in equities, compared with 33% in February. This brings the proportion back to its January level, with investors underweight in financials and more exposed to cyclical shares. In terms of geographical attraction, investors are avoiding the Euro zone due to concerns about Greek debt, even though European investors still consider European shares inexpensive, with 28% of this opinion, compared with 29% in July 2007, when 18% of respondents were underweight in Euro zone equities.
