FrontPoint to liquidate some funds


Due to redemption demands following an accusation of insider trading by one of its portfolio managers, Joseph F. “Chip” Skowron III, and poor returns, FrontPoint Partners will be liquidating some of its hedge funds, the Wall Street Journal reports. However, the management firm did not disclose the scale of the redemption demands, or indicate which funds would be closed.According to sources familiar with the matter, FrontPoint may retain a recent USD1bn fund specialised in lending to mid-sized businesses, a quant-macro fund, and a strategic credit fund.
