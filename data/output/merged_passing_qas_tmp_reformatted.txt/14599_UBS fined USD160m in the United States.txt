UBS fined USD160m in the United States


The United States on 4 May announced that the Swiss bank UBS has agreed to pay USD160m in damages and interest to settle charges of anti-competitive practices on municipal bond markets. The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) say in a statement that UBS had admitted to manipulating the procedure for awarding public contracts to manage these bonds. UBS conspired with other financial institutions between 2001 and 2006 to divide US clients and inflate charges.
