France driving growth in green bonds in Europe


According to the first annual report by the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) at the request of Lyxor, France is expected to continue to drive growth in green bonds in Europe. Several new issuers are preparing to enter the market, strengthening the driving position of France in the promotion of these financial vehicles which support the fight against climate change.The third largest green bond market in the world, and the largest in Europe, with over EUR37bn in cumulative issues since 2012, the French green bond market has accelerated strongly in 2017, with volmes doubling compared with 2016 (excluding an issue of EUR9.7bn of French government bonds, the largest ever). About half of this increase is due to assets from non-financial private issuers, more particularly in the energy sector, midcap companies not upsetting the large players. According to CBI, municipalities, departments and regions are expected to further support the expansion of the market in 2018.The French green bond market is also flourishing thanks to a favourable ecosystem, which can be expected to drive growth, in a sign of the proactive role played by the French government and the French financial market authority, and the attitude of participants involved and French asset managers, who have had a favourable reception for green bonds via dedicated offerings. According to the report, France is also a pioneer in terms of best practices in the area of green bond issues. France has positive perception externally, with over EUR3bn in lending and bonds certified by the Climate Bonds Initiative, and publishes high quality annual declarations.
