Urquijo head steps down


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Cotizalia reports that Manuel San Salvador, deputy CEO of Banco Urquijo (private banking, business banking, asset management), has left the business after being gradually relieved of various responsibilities, as Urquijo also lost its independent status within the Sabadell group (which acquired Urquijo in 2006). Officially, it is a divorce by mutual consent. In practice, it is more a consequence of the rise to power of Ram√≥n de la Riva, who was appointed deputy CEO of Sabadell and executive vice president of Urquijo on 25 November.
