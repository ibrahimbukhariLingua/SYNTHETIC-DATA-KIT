Whitefield cancels performance commissions


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Singapore hedge fund Whitefield Capital Management has decided to cease charging performance commissions until it has doubled its assets under management. Whitefield last year faced redemptions that reduced its assets under management to USD100m. The Asian Opportunities Fund, with about USD30m in assets under management, will not charge fees until it has assets of USD50m to USD100m. The fund has also earned returns of 33% this year, after results of about 80% last year.
