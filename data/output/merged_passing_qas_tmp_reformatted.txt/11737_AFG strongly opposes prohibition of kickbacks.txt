AFG strongly opposes prohibition of kickbacks


Proposed revisions to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) include some clauses which the AFG (the French asset management association) says are a subject of “concern,” in relation to actors as well as products. In particular, the association strongly opposes proposals by the European Commission to forbid makers of financial products from paying mandated managers and independent financial advisers.“The proposal, whose logic is understandable, does not work in practice. It would also drastically stunt the development of open architecture. In other words, the Commission would run against what it has previously supported,” says Paul-Henri de La Porte du Theil, president of the AFG. The proposals would also not benefit investors, he says, whereas complete and transparent information before the transaction would be the best way to ensure protection.The AFG is also concerned about proposals to distinguish between UCITS-compliant funds which are considered complex, and funds which are not complex. The proposal would significantly weaken the UCITS label, which is internationally recognised as a label for funds available to retail clients. From this point of view, the criterion of comprehension is the “promise” that should be retained, for all savings products and policies.The AIFM directive, whose level II dispositions are in the process of being composed, is not a source of comfort either. “Serious” concerns about the European passport for non-European players remain.The only point on which the association says it is satisfied is the legal framework for UCITS IV funds, which had now been transposed into French law, bringing increased legibility for French fund product ranges.
