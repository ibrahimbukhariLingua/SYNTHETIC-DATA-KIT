European Commission agrees to ease terms of ING restructuring plan


The European Commission has agreed to ease the restructuring plan imposed on the Netherlands-based banking and insurance group ING in 2009, in exchange for public assistance of EUR10bn, which were paid to it during the financial crisis, the two parties announced in separate statements on 19 November. ING had initially been required to sell off its various insurance affiliates by the end of 2013, but the European Commission has finally agreed to ease this requirement: new deadlines, some as late as the end of 2018, have been set for the various affiliates, ING says in a statement. A redemption programme for the remaining portion of the public money received from the Netherlands government has been established. The banking/insurance group will be required to pay four instalments of EUR1.125bn each by May 2015 at the latest. Overall, it will have paid EUR13.5bn to the Netherlands government, including redemption premiums.
