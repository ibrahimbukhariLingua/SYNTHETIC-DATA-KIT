BaFin awards HansaInvest a universal license


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Hansainvest Hanseatische Investment GmbH, an affiliate of the insurance group Signal-Iduna, on 6 December announced that it has become the first German management firm to obtain a universal operating license from the Federal financial services supervision office (BaFin). According to JÃ¶rg W. Stotz, CEO, this means that, on the one hand, Hansainvest is authorised to launch all varieties of funds which are already covered by the InvG regulations in force, with immediate effect, and on the other hand, that the manager is now permitted to launch all varieties of funds which have recently been authorised in Germany, without needing to apply for a specific license. The general license does not apply only to the construction of funds, but also to investments (categories of assets) by funds. Management firms which do not have a universal operating license, meanwhile, are required to obtain licenses for each new funds and each new category of assets. Hansainvest reports that it was already the only German management firm allowed to launch and manage securities funds, real estate funds, funds of funds, money market funds, institutional funds and hedge funds. Its range includes more than 90 retail funds and over 30 institutional funds.
