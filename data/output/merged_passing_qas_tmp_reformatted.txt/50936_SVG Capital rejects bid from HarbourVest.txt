SVG Capital rejects bid from HarbourVest


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The British investment fund SVG Capital on 16 September, at a release of its interim results, announced that it was rejecting an unsolicited bed from its US rival HarbourVEst, on the grounds that the bid undervalues the firm. SVG estimates that the bid from HarbourVest, at USD1.35bn, is 11.5% below its net asset value in July. SVG adds in its statement that it is in talks with other potential candidates, whose offers may be more attractive than that of HarbourVest. SVG also states that its net asset value stands at 735 pence as of 31 July 2016 (GBP1.15bn)), up 12% for the half.
