Major hedge funds among buyers of Lehman debt


The Financial Times reports that among those who bought Lehman debt at a heavy discount were several of the largest hedge funds, including Elliott Associates, Paulson & Co, King Street and Centerbridge Partners. But the investment does not mean easy money. It will take years to regain any value, which means that investors will have to pay high legal costs and patiently wait for the courts to reach their verdicts. According to official documents, Elliott, King Street and Paulson hold USD12.5bn in Lehman debt.
