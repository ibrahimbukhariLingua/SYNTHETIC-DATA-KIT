Money market fees destined to increase


The financial ratings agency Moodyâ€™s has expressed criticisms of proposals by the European Commission concerning money market funds. According to the agency, maintaining an adequate rate of return for money market funds with set value per share would impose an increase in fees of at least 30 basis points. The Irish investment fund association, for its part, has called for European and US regulations to be brought into line.
