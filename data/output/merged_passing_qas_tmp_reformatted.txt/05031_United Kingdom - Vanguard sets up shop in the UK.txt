United Kingdom - Vanguard sets up shop in the UK


Vanguard Group, which made a name for itself in the United States for selling low-cost funds, is setting up shop in the United Kingdom, the Financial Times reports. The newspaper predicts that this may trigger a price war in the asset management sector. Vanguard will offer equities and fixed income products to institutionals and to independent financial advisers (IFAs) who agree not to receive commissions.
