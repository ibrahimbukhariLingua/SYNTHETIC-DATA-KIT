IMA critical of ESMA proposals for UCITS-compliant ETFs


The UK’s Investment Management Association (IMA) has published its response to ESMA’s paper on guidelines for UCITS Exchange-Traded Funds and Structured UCITS. It questioned ESMA’s rationale for singling out certain types of UCITS products while excluding others, such as non-UCITS Exchange-Traded products."UCITS are already subject to detailed regulation. Regulatory intervention should happen only where there is a clear market failure, but we see no evidence of this», comments Julie Patterson, director at the IMA. «Regulators are concerned about ‘complexity’ in retail products. But complexity does not necessarily equate to risk. Sophisticated investment strategies often mean less risk for investors in terms of the expected return», she adds.
