15 funds bring Spanish government before a London arbitral tribunal


Cotizalia relays reports in El Confidencial that 15 international funds, including AES Solar, Ampere, Elemento Power, Hazel Capital, HgCapital, Hudson Clean Energy, Impax, NIBC Infraestucture, Platina and 9/Ren, have filed suit in a London arbitral tribunal against the Spanish government. They are seeking about EUR400m, for failure to respect the European energy charter, as the Madrid government has decided to reduce its tax credits for solar energy by 30%, retroactively for the past three years. The funds concerned had invested more than EUR3bn in projects which will be affected by the move.
