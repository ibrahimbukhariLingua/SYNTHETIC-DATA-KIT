UCITS III funds provide complementary products


Fabrice Cuchet, head of alternative management at Dexia Asset Management, says UCITS III hedge funds, known as newcits, “do not aim to replace hedge funds, but to bring a complementary range of products, more liquid and more regulated.” But there are many pitfalls, and one should not assume that newcits create liquidity. “Newcits are not miracle products which will deliver the same performance as hedge funds while offering more liquidity and less risk,” he says. It is likely, in fact, that the average performance of UCITS hedge funds will be lower than those of the hedge fund industry, partly due to a more restrictive UCITS environment for managers, and partly since not all strategies and assets are eligible for UCITS, which reduces the potential sources of performance. Dexia AM offers 22 UCITS III funds, covering 15 different alternative strategies in all asset classes.
