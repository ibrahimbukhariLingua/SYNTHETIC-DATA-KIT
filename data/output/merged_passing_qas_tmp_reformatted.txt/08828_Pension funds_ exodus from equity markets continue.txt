Pension funds: exodus from equity markets continues


Following the recent recovery of the financial markets, a trend for institutional investors to move away from equities markets is continuing, according to a Mercer survey entitled “European Asset Allocation Survey 2010,” which covers over 1000 European pension funds and retirement institutions with more than EUR500bn under management. The trend is more marked for mature regimes, such as British defined contribution funds, for which allocation to equities has fallen from 54% in 2009 to 50% in 2010. In Ireland, equities allocations fell from 60% to 59%, while in the Netherlands this allocation is down from 28% to 23%. the trend is set to continue, with 29% of British and 35% of other European retirement plans planning a further reduction in their allocation to domestic equities. For international equities, more than 20% of British pension plans and 33% of other European plans are also planning a reduction. Although bonds continue to be the dominant asset class in most portfolios of European funds, a marked change has been observed since the 2009 survey. For example, following a significant recovery on equities markets, there are now more (a net total of 12%) British pension plans which are planning to increase their exposure to government bonds, while in 2009 there were more (a net total of 6%) plans planning to lower their exposure to this asset class. The trend has also been reversed for corporate bonds, where only 16% of British pensions are planning to increase their exposure, compared with 27% last year. Investment in non-traditional asset classes remains strong, with increases observed in the UK and Ireland (from 6% to 9% in these two countries in 2010), and in Switzerland (from 19% to 23%).
