IOSCO investigates liquidity management in CIS


The International Organisation of Securities Commissions on December 17 published a report on Liquidity Management Tools in Collective Investment Schemes (CIS) that maps existing liquidity management frameworks in 26 member jurisdictions with a particular focus on tools to help deal with exceptional situations like significant redemption pressure.The report highlights that many liquidity management tools are available to jurisdictions, some of which are specifically tailored to the features and nature of the funds considered (e.g., money market funds, real estate funds, hedge funds). In particular, most jurisdictions clearly distinguish open-ended schemes from closed-ended ones. The most common tools are: redemptions fees; redemptions gates; redemptions in kind; side pockets; and suspension of redemptions. Suspension of redemptions is available in all responding jurisdictions. Regulatory definitions of liquidity or liquid instruments are varied, ranging from no formal definition to quite granular specifications, including lists of asset classes considered to be “liquid” in nature. Where definitions exist they tend to be more principles-based rather than prescriptive in nature. Funds are generally required to have appropriate risk management and internal quality controls to ensure that all material risks are properly identified, assessed, monitored and controlled. Open-ended funds are generally subject to additional regulatory requirements dealing with fund leverage, asset concentration, investor concentration, restrictions on illiquid asset investment and short-term borrowings. IOSCO, through its policy Committee C5 on Investment Management, is conducting work on enhancing collection of data about asset management activity and is considering developing guidance on liquidity risk management beyond its 2013 principles, including on stress testing.
