Hedge fund directive: fund managers were too slow to react, says EFAMA


In an interview with Global Pensions, Jean-Bpatiste de Franssu, the new chairman of EFAMA and CEO of Invesco Europe, claims that problems with the controversial directive on hedge fund managers could have been avoided if EFAMA and other professional associations had declared their opinions earlier and taken a more proactive attitude to regulations, rather than waiting for regulators to establish the new framework. He says that both the range of funds to which the legislation applies (the European Commission bill applies to all non-UCITS funds) and the question of the responsibility of the custodian should be studied further.During his two-year term, de Franssu hopes to establish a level playing field for distribution of funds from asset management firms. He would also like to achieve the creation of a third-pillar retirement system which would allow employees to move freely throughout Europe.
