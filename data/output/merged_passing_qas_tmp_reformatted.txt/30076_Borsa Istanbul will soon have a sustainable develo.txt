Borsa Istanbul will soon have a sustainable development index


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Çetin Ali Dönmez, executive vice president of Borsa Istanbul, has announced that a planned BIST Sustainability sustainable development index created by the Istanbul stock exchange in cooperation with the Turkish Business Council for Sustainable Development (TCBSD) has been awaiting approval from the Capital Market Board (CMB) since February 2012. It would cover 30 equities in companies based in Turkey which meet high criteria in environmental, social and governance (ESG) areas. The index is expected to be launched by the end of the year.Meanwhile, Borsa Istanbul is entering a new phase in its life. Its demutualisation took place in April 2013, and its initial public offering is slated for 2015. Meanwhile, the stock market business is consolidating its positions, and is expected to officially take over the Izmir-based TurkDex derivative market on 5 August, after absorbing the Istanbul gold market earlier this year.Since demutualisation, 10% of capital has been distributed, and the Turkish state now controls a take of slightly under 49%, and 41.5% of capital is owned by the firm itself, as Bolsa Istanbul is reserving these shares for a strategic partner. The Turkish stock market operator is in talks with several major European and Asian operators on the subject. Locally, financial circles feel that after adopting European practices and regulations, the stock market may prefer an Asian actor as a major stakeholder.
