Asian investors seduced by NN Group


The Singapore sovereign fund, Temasek, and RRJ Capital, an Asian investment company founded in 2011 and led by Richard Ong (formerly of Goldman Sachs) and his brother Charles, who worked at Temasek for 10 years, will jointly invest EUR1.275bn in NN Group, an affiliate of ING dedicated to insurance, according to a statement released on the ING website yesterday. In detail, RRJ will invest EUR750m, while Temasek will pay ING EUR425m, in addition to which EUR100m will be paid by Seatown Holdings International, an affiliate of Temasek, according to a statement. In 2008, ING benefited from a bailout plan in exchange for which the Netherlands group agreed to sell its activities as an insurer. After the sale of assets realted to insurance in Asia and the United States, the IPO of NN Group will allow ING to sell its other insurance activities in Europe and Japan, in line with its engagement.
