Revisions to investment law considered to severe


“Global sales of investment funds should not be strangled by an EU corset,” Matthäus Den Otter, director of the Swiss Funds Association (SFA), wanred yesterday, Agefi Switzerland reports. The revisions to the law on investment funds (LPCC) proposed by the Swiss federal council includes too many measures which are discriminatory against the market, particularly sales of collective capital investment products in Switzerland, or from Switzerland. The SFA claims that the proposed regulations on fund sales go far beyond EU standards. It thus disadvantages Swiss wealth managers by applying global standards with a severity that exists nowhere else. Despite their positive points, he says, the proposals show too much zeal in many areas.
