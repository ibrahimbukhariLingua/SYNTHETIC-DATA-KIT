SRI funds: growth driven by conversions of non-SRI funds


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In 2010, socially responsible investment (SRI) funds on sale in France saw a 42% increase in their assets, to EUR48bn, according to the most recent statistics from Novethic. But 90% of this growth, or EUR12.6bn, was due to the adoption of SRI practices by traditional funds.The increase is thus driven by asset management firms and not by savings investors, who actually tended to divest from SRI funds in 2010. Funds saw net outflows of EUR0.5bn over the year. Investor redemptions from money market funds (-EUR480m) did not work to the benefit of equities funds, which also saw outflows (-EUR580m), Novethic reports. Only bond funds saw positive net subscriptions, of EUR620m.That didnâ€™t stop the SRI portion of French collective management from continuing its growth, by 2.38% in 2009, and 3.6% in 2010.The conversion of funds also changed the situation in the rankings of asset management firms active in SRI in the French market. With nearly EUR10bn in assets, Natixis AM tops the list, with the conversion of its Fonsicav fund, a money market funds with several billion euros in assets, to SRI. This puts the firm just ahead of Amundi. Further behind, with under EUR4bn, are BNP Paribas IP, Allianz GI France and Edmond de Rothschild, which lands in fifth place due to the conversion of the Tricolore Rendement fund (EUR2.5bn).
