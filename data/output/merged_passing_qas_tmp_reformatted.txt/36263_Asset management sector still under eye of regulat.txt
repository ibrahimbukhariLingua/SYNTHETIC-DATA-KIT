Asset management sector still under eye of regulators


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; }a:link { } Asset management firms mat face stricter regulations than expected of their activities by global regulators, at a time when intense lobbying has llowed them to avoid a first proposal which had targeted heavyweights in the sector as a priority, according to sources in the sector and G20 heads cited by the news agency Reuters. Regulators may introduce more radical measures, which would affect companies by limiting their activities on markets in periods of turbulence, according to these sources. “The sector may well have shot itself in the foot, since the Financial Stability Board (FSB) is returning fire with an even more radical proposal,” a source in the European asset management sector, cited by Reuters, says. Proposals have not yet been concretised, but the restrictions considered concern flows to a particular asset class, for example governmetn bonds, with a temporary introduction of gates, or prohibitive redemption commissions, to prevent excessively violent flows on markets in periods of turbulence.
