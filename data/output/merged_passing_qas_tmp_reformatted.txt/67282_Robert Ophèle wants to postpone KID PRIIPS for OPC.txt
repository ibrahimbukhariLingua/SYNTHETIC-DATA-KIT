Robert Ophèle wants to postpone KID PRIIPS for OPCVM funds


In a speech to close the fifth annual Asset Management summer university, organised by Convictions AM and the Université Paris Dauphine, the chairman of the AMF, Robert Ophèle, has lent his support to the idea of postponing the extension of KID PRIIPS regulations, which are slated to replace the current DICI/KIID regime on 1 January 2019, for OPCVM funds.The regulator says that the decision will need to be taken by the end of the year by the European Commission, and that there is a danger of creating “a great risk of disturbance to investors and the asset management industry.” He says the implementation of PRIIPS regulations in 2018 would require a stable situation to be created after only one year of application. “By all appearances, KID PRIIPS seems less relevant for OPCVM funds than the current DICI/KIID, and so substituting the second for the first would be a step back, and superimposing both would mean providing the investor with detailed information that is difficult to digest,” he said, citing the example of the risk scale, which is widely different between the two types of document.The candidate to succeed Danièle Nouy as supervisor of the major European banks (see Newsmanagers of 28/08/2018) would thus like to see this extension postponed until the results of the PRIIPS review can be examined, and he says that he intends to defend this position to the European authorities in the coming weeks.
