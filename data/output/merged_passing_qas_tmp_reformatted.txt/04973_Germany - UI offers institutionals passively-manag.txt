Germany - UI offers institutionals passively-managed corporate bond funds


Corporate bonds are now fashionable with investors, thanks to high spreads even for investment-grade rated issuers in Euros. Universal Investment (UI) has therefore decided to open this asset class to institutional investors, by offering them passively-managed Spezialfonds in three varieties, with fees lower than ETF funds, and the ability to individually adapt the product to the needs of each client. On average, fees for corporate bond ETFs are 20 basis points, and UI will be ?considerably less expensive,? says Bernd Obergfell, a spokesman for the management firm.UI Core Corporate Bonds products are available in three strategies. The replication process is the closest to ETF methodologies, and reproduces a liquid index in its entirety, in the form of physical bonds. For the ?spread-oriented? (Spread-Orientierung) strategy, UI uses credit spreads by combining CDS backed by corporate bond indices with physical bonds such as jumbo-Pfandbriefe, which allows for a reasonable diversification, even at limited volumes. As default risks remain limited and the product may be hedged easily, this strategy is suitable for guaranteed product concepts.Lastly, with the ?stratified sampling? strategy, UI reduces risk compared with very broad indices through a methodical progressive filtering process, which limits the investment universe to 100-150 bonds, so that the subscriber gets a portfolio of physical bonds with a high correlation to the benchmark, without the use of derivatives.
