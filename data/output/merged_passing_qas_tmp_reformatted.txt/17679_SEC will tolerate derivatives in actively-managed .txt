SEC will tolerate derivatives in actively-managed ETFs


Norm Champ, director of the investment management division of the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced at a press conference in New York that the US regulator is no longer planning to oppose the use of derivatives by actively-managed ETFs, Index Universe reports. However, the SEC has not yet lifted its moratorium on inverse or leveraged ETFs.The end of the ban on derivatives may have a rapid effect on some highly popular ETFs, such as the Pimco Total Return ETF by Bill Gross (USD3.83bn in assets).
