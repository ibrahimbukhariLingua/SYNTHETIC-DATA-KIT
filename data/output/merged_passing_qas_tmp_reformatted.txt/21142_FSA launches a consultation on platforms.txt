FSA launches a consultation on platforms


The British Financial Services Authority (FSA) on 27 June launched a consultation on regulation on the activities of platforms, which includes a proposed prohibition on kickbacks from product providers, as well as increased transparency about fees charged. According to the FSA, a ban on kickbacks paid by fund managers to platforms would represent a shortfall for the operators of these platforms of about GBP10m to compensate for. The costs related to the rules proposed by the FSA are in a range from GBP11.6m to GBP37.8m, according to estimates by Deloitte. The FSA hopes to release final rules on platforms by the end of the year, to come into effect on 31 December 2013.
