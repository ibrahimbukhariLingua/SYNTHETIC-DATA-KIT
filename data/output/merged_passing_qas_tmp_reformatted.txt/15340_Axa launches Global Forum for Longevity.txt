Axa launches Global Forum for Longevity


AXA on 28 March kicked off the Global Forum for Longevity, an initiative to encourage sharing of knowledge and organizing on the topic of longevity. The Global Forum for Longevity, conceived as a space for debate and exchange between researchers, experts and decision-makers, is hoping to promote a more positive vision of longevity, working on opportunities which longevity gives rise to that are not yet adequately exploited (see article in this issue of Newsmanagers).On the occasion, AXA announced that the AXA research fund (Fonds AXA pour le Recherche) has set the goal of dedicating EUR10m over two years to financing projects to bring about better understanding and control of the consequences of the lengthening human life span. The AXA research fund already permits over 50 researchers and research teams in France and throughout Europe to develop a common knowledge base on the subject of longevity.“I am convinced that lengthening life expectancy represents one of the most important challenges for the 21st century, both for developed economies and for emerging ones. Due to its business, AXA is a privileged observer of demographic and social evolution worldwide. It is our responsibility to stimulate sharing of knowledge in order to allow businesses to better understand the challenges this demographic revolution presents, and to fully benefit from the opportunities it presents,” said Henri de Castries, president and CEO of AXA.
