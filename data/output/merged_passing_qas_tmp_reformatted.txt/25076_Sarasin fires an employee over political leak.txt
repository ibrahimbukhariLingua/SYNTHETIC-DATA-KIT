Sarasin fires an employee over political leak


The Basel-based Banque Sarasin (Safra group) on the evening of 3 January announced that it has dismissed one employee from its IT department with immediate effect, after the employee confessed to leaking documents related to currency trades made by a member of the family of Philippe Hildebrand, president of the Swiss national bank (BNS) to a lawyer with ties to the Swiss People’s Party. The family member appears to have been the gallery owner Kashya Hildebrand, the central banker’s wife. An interview was held on 11 November with the Swiss federal minister Christoph Blocher, a leader of the Swiss People’s Party (at that time, Sarasin was still part of the Dutch Rabobank group).The employee, who has admitted to the deed, voluntarily reported to the Zurich cantonal police on 1 January 2012.Sarasin has apologised to the client for the disagreements provoked by this breech of the principle of confidentiality. The bank has also condemned the leakage of confidential banking information for political ends in the strongest possible terms. Sarasin also states that it has reported the case to the Swiss financial market surveillance authority (Finma) and reserves the right to take legal action.
