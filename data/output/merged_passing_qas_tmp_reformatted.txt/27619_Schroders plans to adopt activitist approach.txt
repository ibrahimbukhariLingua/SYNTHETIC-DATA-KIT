Schroders plans to adopt activitist approach


Peter Harrison, the new head of UK equities at Schroders, has told Financial News that activist shareholding will become an asset class in its own right in the next few years. “Strategic engagement with the business to think about the way you can earn value for shareholders is also a good thing for returns, as is corporate responsibility, and that is a change which the sector has not yet taken into account,” he says.
