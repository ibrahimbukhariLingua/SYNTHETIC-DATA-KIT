Donner concludes acquisition of Reuschel


The transaction by which Conrad Hinrich Donner Bank, an affiliate of Signal Iduna, has acquired the private bank Reuschel & Co Privatbankiers from Commerzbank was concluded on Monday, 2 November. The integration of the acquired entity must be completed in the space of twelve months. The new establishment will be known as “Donner & Reuschel Privatbank seit 1798,” and will have two headquarters, one in Hamburg, and one in Munich (see Newsmanagers of 25 September), but the legal headquarters will be located in Hamburg, as Donner is the buyer. The new merged entity will have about EUR7.5bn in assets.
