Deutsche Bank plans to release 30 ETF funds


Mitsuhisa Murata, managing director and head of global markets structuring at Deutsche Securities, has told Reuters that the German group is planning to list 30 or more ETF funds (db x-trackers) in Japan in the coming year, the Guardian reports. Deutsche Bank has initially been offering six of its 13 db x-trackers listed in Hong Kong since February. The next funds to be offered on the Japanese market will also be products listed in Hong Kong and Singapore, though in a later phase there are plans to list ETFs directly in Japan.
