Old Mutual negotiating sale of activities in Italy with Cinven


The Old Mutual group on Thursday, 4 August announced that it has entered exclusive negotiations with the European private equity firm Cinen over a sale of Old Mutual Wealth Italy, its Italian wealth management activities. “It is not certain that the negotiations will result in a transaction,” Old Mutual says in a statement, however. Cinven has recently made waves on the Italian market by finalising its acquisition of ERGO Italia, a provider of life and non-life insurance solutions.
