UniCredit to sell or hold IPO for Pioneer Investments


UniCredit aims to sell or hold an initial public offering for its asset management firm Pioneer Investments, at a price of EUR2-3bn, as part of an asset sell-off programme, the Financial Times reports, citing sources close to the bank. The move may come next year. UniCredit, which announced a record loss of EUR14bn last week, had already tried to sell Pioneer four years ago, but dropped the plans shortly after the arrival of Federico Ghizzoni as CEO. A source familiar with the matter explains that the bank pulled out of talks with the French firm Amundi four years ago under political pressure.
