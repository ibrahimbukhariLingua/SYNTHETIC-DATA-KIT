Man Group gives itself three years to attack Chinese market


Man Group wants to increase its presence in Asia, and is taking a closer look at the Chinese market, Hedge Week reports. The publicly-traded hedge fund is currently engaged in efforts to sign contracts with public institutions. Conquering the private investment market in the country would be the next step, says Man Group CEO Peter Clarke. He estimates that sales of hedge funds to Chinese investors could be possible in the next three years.
