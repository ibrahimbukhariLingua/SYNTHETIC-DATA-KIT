Telefónica tightens leash of Fonditel


Telefónica will name the new CEO of Fonditel, the management firm responsible for its pension fund (EUR3.04bn), probably this week, Expansión reports. The new CEO will be a member of the team led by Santiago Fernández Valbuena, Telefónica’s CFO. Fonditel’s strategy will not be modified in an initial stage, as the new team will aim to retore Fonditel to the position as an investor of reference in the Spanish market, which it occupied until the crisis brought losses of 26.9% for the pension fund in 2008 (the fund earned 6.58% in 2009). Fonditel will seek to reduce its “public visibility,” i.e. high levels of media attention to its managers, and to improve the functioning and co-ordination of the team of specialists it employs.
