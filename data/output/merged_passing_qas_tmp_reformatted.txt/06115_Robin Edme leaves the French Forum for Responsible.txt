Robin Edme leaves the French Forum for Responsible Investment


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Robin Edme has announced that he is leaving the French Forum for Responsible Investment, of which he was one of the founders in 2001, and has been president since 2003. He has decided to hand over power to a new management, stating that the job which was set out for him, to make the FRI a tool for socially responsible investment for its members, has been completed, a statement says. He will present his resignation to the board of directors on 15 December, and the FRI office will propose Bertrand Fournier, vice president of the FRI and chairman of the board at LFP-Sarasin AM, as its new president at that meeting.Edme will continue to work at the FRI; he will handle the international portion of the representation on the French forum, where he will continue to represent the board of directors of Eurosif, on which he is vice-chairman, and will continue the work begun with European bodies (he is coordinator of the ECRA initiative, which includes 10 European investor organisations and promotes the integration of extra-financial reporting into financial reporting). “The next few years will see an increase of my involvement with these European bodies, to strengthen our relations with our international counterparts, make the voice of our organisation heard, and promote the principles of a modern and pioneering French approach to SRI, in a market environment in which these approaches often remain dominated by a highly anglo-saxon philosophy,” says Edme.
