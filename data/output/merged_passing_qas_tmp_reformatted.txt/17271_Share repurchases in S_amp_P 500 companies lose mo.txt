Share repurchases in S&amp;P 500 companies lose momentum in third quarter


Companies belonging to the S&P 500 index spent less on equity repurchases in third quarter, according to the research agency FactSet Research, the CFO Journal reports. The slowdown may, however, be temporary, in light of an announced desire on the part of several companies, such as General Electric and United Technologies, to restart their equity repurchasing programmes. Over third quarter as a whole, companies in the S&P 500 index dedicated a total of USD93.4bn to equity repurchasing operations, a figure which is down 15.1% compared with second quarter, and 25.8% year on year.
