Regulators snub investors


Investors had virtually no opportunity to provide input on major European financial reforms, as regulators let them out of consultation panels, the European Federation of Financial Services Users (EuroFinuse) regrets. The federation accuses regulators in particular of adding institutional representatives to user panels as “users of financial services,” such as Peter De Proft, the head of EFAMA, and Xavier Rolet, CEO of the London Stock Exchange, Financial Times Fund Management relates. More retail users had been expected. Overall, only three to four of the 30 members of each committee were real defenders of consumers, according to Guillaume Prache, head of EuroFinuse.
