Aberdeen fined GBP7.2m


The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has fined Aberdeen Asset Managers Limited and Aberdeen Fund Management Limited (Aberdeen) GBP7,192,500 for failing to identify, and therefore properly protect, client money placed in Money Market Deposits (MMDs) with third party banks between September 2008 and August 2011. Aberdeen incorrectly determined that this money was not subject to FCA rules, which meant that they did not obtain the correct documentation from third party banks when setting up the affected accounts.Aberdeen fully cooperated with the FCA’s investigation and agreed to settle at an early stage, qualifying for a 30% discount to their fine. Without the discount the fine would have been GBP10,275,000.No clients suffered any loss as a result of the breaches and at no point were client funds mixed with the company’s own money,» Aberdeen said in a statement.
