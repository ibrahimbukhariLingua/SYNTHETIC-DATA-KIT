Citigroup sued by Abu Dhabi sovereign fund


The bank Citigroup announced on Tuesday, 15 December, that it has been named in a lawsuit filed in a New York court by the Abu Dhabi sovereign fund, which, under an agreement signed in 2007, is obliged to buy ordinary shares in the bank for a total of USD7.5bn on specific dates in 2010 and 2011. At the time, shares in the bank were considerably more valuable than they are now. In its lawsuit, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) cites “false and fraudulent declarations” on the part of Citigroup, and seeks an annulment of the agreement, and damages and interest of USD4bn. The bank vigorously denies the accusations.
