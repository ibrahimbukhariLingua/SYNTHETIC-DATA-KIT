German institutionals avoiding risk


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The most recent edition of an annual study undertaken since 2005 by Universal Investment of risk management by German institutional investors has found that the financial crisis reversed their priorities. Performance is now a priority for only 7% of the 83 institutionals surveyed (EUR360bn in total assets), compared with 27% in 2007. At the same time, the security of the investment has become a priority for 70% of respondents, up from 22%. This evolution has resulted in changes in asset allocation. Between 2008 and 2010, exposure to bonds and money market instruments increased sharply, while the proportion allocated to equities decreased. Union Investment has also found that fluctuations in financial markets during the crisis led institutional investors to focus on risk of loss in absolute terms, which has resulted in an increase in populatiry for absolute return mandates and guaranteed concepts. In the past, investors had long preferred benchmarked strategies, while risk was only considered in terms of the volatility of the benchmark index and the tracking error. The study also finds that 69% of respondents, up from 62% in 2009, consider the legal risks to be the most important. But reputational and environmental risks are also gaining importance, with 59% and 24%, compared with 38% and 4%, respectively, one year ago. Many institutional investors are now tending to use sustainable investments as a complementary instrument for risk management. This has the advantage of complementing largely quantitative models with qualitative criteria.
