Case by investors in Madoff feeder funds dismissed


Agefi reports that a US federal judge yesterday found that investors in feeder funds with ties to the investment company of Bernard Madoff were not entitled to claim the status of clients of the former fiancier. The verdict is a victory for Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee seeking to reclaim funds for former Madoff clients, the newspaper adds.
