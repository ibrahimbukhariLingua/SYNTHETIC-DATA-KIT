AG2R La Mondiale plans cross-border retirement product


Michel Denizot, director of international business, has told IPE that AG2R La Mondiale is planning to create a cross-border pension fund, but only if the European Commission provides certain guarantees about revisions to the IORP directive. The fund would be focused solely on France, and would not seek subscribers elsewhere in Europe. It may include all assets in the second and third pillars managed by AG2R La Mondiale.
