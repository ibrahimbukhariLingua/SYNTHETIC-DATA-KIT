Spain opens market to other ETF promoters


According to Expansi√≥n, the Spanish government has decided to modify its regulations to bring the tax regime applicable to ETFs registered in the form of Sicav funds into line with the regime for traditional funds. This has previously been the largest obstacle to the entry of iShares (BlackRock) and db x-trackers (Deutsche Bank), among others, into the Spanish market. Currently, only BBVA and Lyxor are active on this market.The Spanish government is also planning to cancel minimal subscriptions of EUR50,000 for professional investors to local hedge funds, and to authorize real estate funds to invest in other real estate funds and in SOCIMI (Spanish REITs), which would make it possible to launch real estate funds of funds.
