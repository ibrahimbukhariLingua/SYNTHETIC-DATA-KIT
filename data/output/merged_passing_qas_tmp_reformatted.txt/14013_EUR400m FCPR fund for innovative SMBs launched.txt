EUR400m FCPR fund for innovative SMBs launched


On 1 June, at a meeting of more than 300 digital pioneers, Eric Besson, minister for industry, energy and digital economy, René Ricol, general commissioner for investment, and Augustin de Romanet, CEO of the Caisse des Dépôts, announced the creation of a risk common investment vehicle (FCPR) entitled “FSN PME,” which will have EUR400m in assets managed by CDC Entreprises. The FCPR fund will invest up to 30% of its own equity, up to a limit of EUR10m, in the capital of digital sector SMBs. FSN PME is a response to a well-known problem in the digital domain, where many startups don’t manage to finance their growth and increase their owners’ equity in order to grow. It fills a void between seed capital and money to fund the creation of businesses, and investment from major institutional investors. The initiative is a part of the Fonds national pour la Société Numérique (FSN), managed by the Caisse des Dépôts, which has EUR4.25bn in capital, of which EUR1.4bn is aimed to finance investment projects in new and innovative digital uses, services and content. The sectors in which the FSN will act as a first priority are: cloud computing, content industries (cultural, scientific or educational), underlying digital technolgies (including nanotech and deployed technologies), health, education, network security and resilience, intelligent transportation systems, and urban digital technologies. The digital economy now represents over 1,150,000 jobs, directly or indirectly, most of them at SMBs. The government has made it a priority to invest in digital sector SMBs in order to accelerate their growth. “By the end of the year, I would like to see more than 30 innovative projects receive instructions from this FCPR for SMBs. This government intervention should make it possible for champions of the internet of the future to emerge in France,” Besson says.
