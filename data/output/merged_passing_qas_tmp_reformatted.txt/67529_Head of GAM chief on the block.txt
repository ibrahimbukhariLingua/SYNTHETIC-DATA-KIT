Since the suspension of its manager, Tim Haywood, the asset management firm has had a turbulent period, which it cannot free itself from. Despite attempts at explanation and liquidation of funds set up by the manager, GAM is still under the eye of investors. Investors have judged the communications from the asset management firm severely, as well as its lack of coherence in its management of personnel. The result is that criticisms have been rising to a peak, and increasingly frequently, questions have been raised about Alex Friedman, CEO of GAM, the specialist website finews reports. “Pressure from investors on “Alex” is increasing. I know that some [investors] are unahppy, and would welcome a change in management,” said Daniel Regli, an analyst at Mainfirst.It would seem that the management at GAM over-reacted by suspending Haywood so quickly, in a situation that was admittedly already complicated, due to the poor performance of the markets, a profit warning, and a write-down on the acquisition of Cantab. The handling of the Haywood affair has only driven GAM stocks lower, from an already low position. And the asset management firm doesn’t seem aware of the importance of good communication policies to its reputation either, though this reputation is already damaged. A spokesperson for GAM has recently told finews that questions raised by analysts over this affair are “BS,” an abbreviation for “bullshit.”
