Candriam launches an SRI high yield bond fund


Candriam Investors Group, an asset management firm with assets totalling EUR111bn, controlled by New York Life Investment Management, will this morning announce the launch of Candriam SRI Bond Global High Yield. This fund pairs a long-only approach to the global high yield bond market with the socially repsonsible investment approach of Candriam. The strategy offers access to the high yield asset class, while limiting exposure to issuers who have non-sustainable growth models, or which do not respect the environment and social values. “We think that an exhaustive analysis of ESG criteria and risks related to issuers is indispensable for taking clear investment decisions concerning bond investments, and especially corporate securities. Combining our ESG analyses without fundamental analyses, we seek to reduce and diversify the risks in our investment strategy,” says Wim Van Hyfte, Ph.D., head of investments and SRI research. The SRI Bond Global High Yield fund from Candriam is currently registered in Luxembourg, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. SRI currently represents over 25% of total assets under management at Candriam. The asset management firm also has over 20 years of experience in high yield, in which it now manages over EUR8bn.
