Institutionals expected to revise their risk management strategies


The risk management strategies of institutional investors urgently require revision, according to the most recent edition of the RiskMonitor survey from AllianzGI. The study, conducted by AllianzGI in frist quarter 2016, includes responses from 755 institutional investors surveyed about their behaviour in the face of risk, particularly in terms of portfolio construction and asset allocation. The firms surveyed represent over EUR24trn in assets under management, spread over 23 countries in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.RiskMonitor found that practices in terms of risk management have not developed greatly since the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008. Before the crisis, the three main strategies deployed by investors aere based on diversification by asset class (57%), geographical diversification (53%), and duration management (44%). Despite the fact that 62% of investors surveyed admit that these strategies have not brought the protection sought against the risk of loss, in practice, use of them has increased since the crisis. 58% of investors say they use diversification by asset class, 56% use geographical diversification, and 54% use duration management.As a result, two thirds of institutional investors would like to be able to use innovative strategies to better balance their risk/return ratio, and 54% say they have allocated additional resources to improve risk management.Institutional investors have identified a number of external risks which may compromise the performance of their investments. Worldwide, the weakness of global growth (for 38% of investors), the economic situation in China (for 37%) and geopolitical tension related to the refugee crisis (for 33%) are cited.
