Hedge funds pessimistic about US equities


Hedge fund managers are now pessimistic about US equities, according to the most recent survey by TrimTabs Investment Research and BarclayHedge. About 38% of 87 managers surveyed are predicting that the S&P 500 index will fall, compared with 29% in May. Only 27% are predicting that the index will rise, compared with 30% in May. This pessimism is not preventing hedge funds from announcing in the meanwhile that they will be increasing their leverage in the next few weeks. About 74% of hedge funds are ruling out the possibility that the Fed will announce another wave of quantitative easing.
