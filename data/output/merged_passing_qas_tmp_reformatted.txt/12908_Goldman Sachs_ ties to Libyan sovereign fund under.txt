Goldman Sachs’ ties to Libyan sovereign fund under scrutiny


Goldman Sachs Group has announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission is undertaking an investigation to determine whether it has violated anti-corruption laws. According to reports in the Wall Street Journal, the regulator is examining the bank’s relations with the Libyan sovereign fund, the Libyan Investment Authority. In 2008, Goldman made options trades for the fund, but they suffered losses of more than USD1 billion. The SEC is now looking into a commission of USD50m which the bank agreed to pay in order to help the fund make back its losses. Although the sum was never paid, Goldman may still be accused of an infraction of the corruption law.
