Deutsche Bank launches a dividend fund


db-X funds, Deutsche Bank’s structured funds division, has launched a fund that gives investors US dividend-focused exposure using its proprietary CROCI® stock selection methodology, according to a press released published on November 26. The DB Platinum CROCI® US Dividends Fund provides returns linked to the CROCI® US Dividends-Net Return Index, which aims to identify shares in the S&P 500 with above-average and sustainable dividend yields. The launch comes on the back of the launch of the DB Platinum CROCI® Global Dividends fund, which has amassed USD85m in assets in less than three months.
