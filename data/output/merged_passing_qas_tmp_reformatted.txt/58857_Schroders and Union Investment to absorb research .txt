Schroders and Union Investment to absorb research costs


Schroders is turning on its heels. After announcing a desire to transfer the costs of external research to its clients as MiFID II comes into force in January 2018, the asset management firm has decided to reverse itself. “We have concluded that we need to absorb the cost of research for clients affected by MiFID II,” said Peter Harrison, CEO of Schroders, cited in a statement. Initially, the asset management firm had announced that the costs of external research for actively-managed equity funds would be passed on to clients. In the past few weeks, several big names in asset management, including BlackRock, have announced decisions to fully bear the cost of this research. These positions will undoubtedly have influenced the decision of Schroders. Union Investment has also decided to reverse itself. According to Reuters, the German asset management firm on Friday announced plans to absorb the cost of research, after previously announced plans to transfer these to clients. “Union Investment has decided that it will no longer pass on the costs of external research which are now integrated into its own results,” the asset management firm announced in a statement carried by Reuters.
