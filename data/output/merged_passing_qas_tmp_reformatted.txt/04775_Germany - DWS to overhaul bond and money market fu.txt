Germany - DWS to overhaul bond and money market fund ranges


Asoka Wöhrmann, who will become head of FI management at DWS, replacing Heinz Fesser, has told the Financial Times Deutschland that the Deutsche Bank management firm is planning to reduce the number of bond funds on offer from 70 to 30, and to ?drastically? reduce the number of money market funds on offer. The bond range will be composed of funds with more clearly readable risk profiles. For money market funds, there will be two sub-groups with different risk levels, which will invest in assets with different maturities.
