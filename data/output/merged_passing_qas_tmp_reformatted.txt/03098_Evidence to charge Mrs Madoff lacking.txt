Evidence to charge Mrs Madoff lacking


Federal investigators have concluded for now there is no physical evidence that Ruth Madoff, the wife of Bernard Madoff, actively participated in or concealed her husband’s fraud, according to two people familiar with the matter cited by the Wall Street Journal. Without new disclosures or incriminating testimony from witnesses, the 68-year-old Mrs. Madoff won’t be criminally charged.
