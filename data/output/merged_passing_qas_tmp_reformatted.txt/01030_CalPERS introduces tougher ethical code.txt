CalPERS introduces tougher ethical code


The board of trustees of CalPERS in Mid-December resolved to toughen its code of governance. At its most recent meeting, members of the board granted the chairman authority to sanction members of the board for their conduct. They may be required to attend annual training sessions which will inform them of all their responsibilities, particularly in relation to investors in the fund. “By strengthening our governance policy, we are seeking to ensure that our board members respect the strictest standards. The new recommendations help us to maintain perspective on the most important thing: the quality of our investments,” says a statement released on 29 December by the chairman of the board of trustees of CalPERS, Rob Feckner. Among the measures approved by the board of directors are a requirement that members of the board provide the chief investment officer of CalPERS with all available information regarding existing or potential investments. The new ethical code also requires members of the board to abstain, in their relations with any CalPERS personnel, from recommending any actions relative to investments outside of a meeting of the board or of its committees. The ethical code and rules regarding conflicts of interest will be incorporated into the governance rules of CalPERS to create a single document of reference on the subject.
