Currency exchange fees are too high


According to a study by Russell Investments entitled “Are your FX fees too high?” foreign exchange commissions paid by managers are indeed excessive. Over a 40-year period, commissions for currency exchange transactions can represent as much as 2% of the total value of a portfolio, Russell finds. Russell analysed 40,000 currency transactions conducted by managers with custodians or other counterparties between January 2008 and December 2009, on institutional assets totalling USD19bn. The cost of a transaction came to about 9 basis points, compared with an average range of 1 to 3 basis points for the most commonly-traded currencies. These findings are highly similar to those of a study undertaken in 2004, covering 36,000 transactons. Costs have been neglected for a long time, the study estimates, and suggests that using the services of an agent like Russell can reduce fees or at least keep them low.
