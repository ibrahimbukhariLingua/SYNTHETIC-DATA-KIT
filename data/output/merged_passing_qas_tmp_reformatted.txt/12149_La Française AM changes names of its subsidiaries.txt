La Française AM changes names of its subsidiaries


As reported in Newsmanagers yesterday, the UFG-LFP group announced on Monday that it is changing its name, to become La Française AM. Wit this new identity, “which evokes the French touch, the group confirms the French basis on which it rests, and emphasizes its desire to take a new step in its development, in France and abroad,” a statement says. With this in view, the names of all structures of the group will be changing. Among the asset management firms, UFG REM becomes La Française Real Estate managmers, and LFP becomes once again La Française des Placements. Among distribution and private management firms, UFG-LFP France becomes La Française AM Finance Services, and UFG-LFP Gestion Privée becomes La Française AM Gestion Privée. The changes will take effect from 29 September.
