Pictet soon to release a UCITS fund


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Pictet is presently still awaiting AMF approval to release a UCITS-compliant fund of hedge funds, managed by Cristina Bagnoli Mandic at Pictet Alternative Investments (PAI), in France. The product invests in CTA (futures), global macro and long/short equity markets, with a preference for liquid strategies, a major preoccupation of PAI (see Newsmanagers of 15 December 2010). The fund has weekly liquidity, and does not use swaps on offshore funds.
