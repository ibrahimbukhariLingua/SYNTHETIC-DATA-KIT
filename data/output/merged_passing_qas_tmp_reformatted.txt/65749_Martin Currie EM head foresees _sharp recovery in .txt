Martin Currie EM head foresees «sharp recovery in Brazilian assets»


Kim Catechis, head of Global Emerging Markets at Legg Mason’s subsidiary Martin Currie, expects a sharp recovery in Brazilian equities, bonds and currency as a consequence of Jair Bolsonaro’s election as president of Brazil on 28 October 2018."Global marketsremain skittish, but it would appear investors believe Bolsonaro (who will outsource his economic policy to his proposed finance minister Paul Guedes) will deliver on market friendly social security reform and relaunched plans for privatisation. As a result, we should expect a sharp recovery in Brazilian assets, equities, bonds and currency,» Catechis commented.Martin Currie’s global emerging markets chief assessed Bolsonaro may face strong opposition to his reforms, especially from unions. «Importantly, there is support for some key ‘anchors’ to remain in post Ilan Goldfajn at the Central Bank and Guedes at the Ministry of Finance,» he said. Also Catechis suggested investors will be «happy with modest reforms».
