SEC approves JPMorgan copper ETF


The Securities and Exchange Commission has approved an ETF by JPMorgan backed by physical copper, despite vocal opposition from users of the metal and some politicians, the Financial Times reports. Senator Carl Levin argues that the ETF will lead to an increase in copper prices and volatility. A copper ETF from iShares (BlackRock) is also expected to be licensed soon.
