Russell launches a range of defensive fundamental indices


As a complement to the Russell Defensive indices, which are cap-weighted, Russell Indexes is launching the Russell High Efficiency Defensive Indexes™, which integrate a range of economic and market risk factors, to create a stability score which is intended to help investors to identify high quality and low volatility equities and to over- or underweight their exposures in line with their stability score, rather than their capitalisation size.Russell Indexes also announces that the new High Efficiency Defensive indices represent the first and only range of Russell low volatility indices to offer a low tracking error, which is important for retirement savings plans and foundations. This characteristic is the result of a cooperation with Westpeak Global Advisors, with the new Russell indices based on its ActiveBet® portfolio construction methodology.Initially, the High Efficiency Defensive Indexes range will include 22 indices, which will be derived from the Russell US and Global indices.
