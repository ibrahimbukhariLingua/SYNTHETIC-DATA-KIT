Real estate fund crisis endangering funds of funds


According to an analysis by the ratings agency Scope, open-ended real estate funds which have suspended their redemptions are endangering funds of funds, Handelsblatt reports. Once real estate funds reopen their redemption windows, there is a danger that funds of funds will call in their money immediately.Scope analysed funds of funds with assets of EUR3.1bn, and found that 60% of their portfolios are composed of shares in real estate funds. In three cases, the funds of funds themselves which were closed to redemptions had 70% to 90% of their assets frozen in closed real estate funds. Handelsblatt cites the recent case of the Premium Management Immobilien-Anlagen fund of funds, which Allianz Global Investors announced in mid-August would be liquidated (probably this month), with EUR500m, or EUR19 per share, to be paid out to subscribers. This represents a considerable loss for clients.Many funds of funds are invested in the Morgan Stanley P2 Value fund, which will be liquidated. The next funds to reopen, in mid-November, will be the Axa Immoselect and the DEGI International (Aberdeen). If the re-opening is a failure, these funds will also have to be liquidated.
