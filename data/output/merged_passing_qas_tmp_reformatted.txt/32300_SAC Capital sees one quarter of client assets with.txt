SAC Capital sees one quarter of client assets withdrawn


In March, SAC Capital will redeem USD600m to clients who asked to withdraw before the deadline of 14 February, and another USD1bn by the end of the year, to investors who have requested redemption of their shares; in total, that will represent USD1.7bn, or more than one quarter of the USD6bn SAC has under management for external clients, the Wall Street Journal reports.These withdrawals appear to have been triggered by a Federal investigation into six former SAC employees for insider trading. The alternative asset management firm also announced in November that it could be facing a civil lawsuit by regulators. SAC claims, however, that the firm and its founder, Steven A. Cohen, acted appropriately and are cooperating with investigators.
