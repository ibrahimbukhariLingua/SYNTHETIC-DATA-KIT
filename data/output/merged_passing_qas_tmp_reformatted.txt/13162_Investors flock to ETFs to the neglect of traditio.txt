Investors flock to ETFs to the neglect of traditional funds


According to the most recent statistics from Morningstar, long-term funds (excluding money markets) in June saw net redemptions of USD4.5bn, after net inflows of USD22.6bn in May. In other words, these funds have seen their first net outflows since October 2010. In the first six months of the year, long-term funds attracted USD134.33bn, while money market funds saw net outflows of USD113.44bn. Aversion to risk led investors to withdraw about USD18bn from US equities funds in June, which represents the largest outflow from this asset class since the peak of the credit crisis in October 2008. Subscribers have also lost their appetite for credit risk, as they withdrew a net USD6.3bn from high yield funds. However, ETFs attracted USD9.8bn in June, following net outflows of USD3.1bn in May. For first half as a whole, ETFs have seen inflows of USD57.3bn. US equities ETFs in first half saw net subscriptions of USD23.6bn, while taxable bonds took on USD15.1bn, international equities funds took in USD11.4bn, and ETFs specialised in alternative assets attracted USD10.4bn. Only commodities ETFs saw net outflows, totalling USD3.91bn in first half, of which USD892m were in June.
