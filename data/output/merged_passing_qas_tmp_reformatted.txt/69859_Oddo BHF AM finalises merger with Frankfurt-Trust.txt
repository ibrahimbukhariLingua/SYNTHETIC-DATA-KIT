Oddo BHF AM finalises merger with Frankfurt-Trust


Frankfurt-Trust Investment-Gesellschaft mbH finalised its merger with Oddo BHF Asset Managemetn GmbH on 30 April 2018. The operation was announced in November last year. Frankfurt Trust is a German asset management firm, which had been part of BHF before the acquisition by Oddo, but whose activities and assets had not yet been integrated. Oddo BHF Asset Management, now with EUR61bn in assets, takes a place as the “third-largest independent actor in asset management in Europe,” a statement says. Oddo BHF AM now has nearly 300 employees, and three investment centres in Paris, Düsseldorf and Frankfurt.“With the merger of Frankfurt-Trust and Oddo BHF AM GmbH, we want to strengthen our single French-German asset management model. We now share a single identity, a single brand, a single organisation and a single combined product range, which gives our clients a vast selection of expertise. Our ambition is to extend our partnership with distributor clients, while deepening our relationship with institutional investors,” says Nicolas Chaput, Global CEO and co-CIO of Oddo BHF Asset Management.
