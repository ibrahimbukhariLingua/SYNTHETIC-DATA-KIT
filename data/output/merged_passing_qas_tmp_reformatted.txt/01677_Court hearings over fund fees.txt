Court hearings over fund fees


Court proceedings begin on Monday in the United States which will have major ramifications for the mutual fund industry. In the case Jones v. Harris Associates, subscribers claim that Harris, an asset management firm based in Chicago with assets under management of about USD50bn, overcharged them on retail funds it runs under the brand name Oakmark, largely because it charged less to its institutional clients, the Financial Times reports. If the courts find in favour of subscribers, fees may be set to fall in the sector.
