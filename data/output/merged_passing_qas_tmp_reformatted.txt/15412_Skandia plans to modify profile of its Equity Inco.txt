Skandia plans to modify profile of its Equity Income fund of funds


If three quarters of shareholders vote to approve a proposal at their extraordinary general shareholders’ meeting on 30 March, François Zagame will cease to manage the Skandia Equity Income Fund (GBP66m), a fund of fund focused on British equities, and the fund will be handed to O’Shaughnessy Asset Management, which will aim to transform the product into a fund of funds which will aim to capture high dividends worldwide. The fund would then change its name on 31 March, to become known as the Skandia Global Equity Income.
