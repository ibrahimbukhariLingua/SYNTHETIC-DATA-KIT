MiFID directive: British managers want rules adapted to various instruments


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The British investment management association (IMA) on 7 February announced in a statement that it would like to see the establishment of consistent regulations for markets in Europe as well as improved market data. In response to a consultation by the European Community about the MiFID directive, the wholesale director at the professional association, Guy Sears, says it is fundamental to take into account the particularities of various instruments. “The rules applicable to markets other than equities markets should be adapted to each instrument, and should not be based on equities markets,” Sears says. “We are in favour of proposals by the Commission to improve the quality of post-trade information on equities markets. The Commission should ensure that it has the power to introduce a general system of market data collection, even if the sector is still able to set up a solution of its own,” Sears also remarks. In the chapter on distribution and sales, the IMA says it is not in favour of the distinction between complex and simple products applicable to UCITS funds. According to the professional association, UCITS products are aimed at retail clients, and are subject to prudent risk management, with a separation of the roles of parties responsible for supervision and management of activities and assets, and as a result are non-complex vehicles by definition.
