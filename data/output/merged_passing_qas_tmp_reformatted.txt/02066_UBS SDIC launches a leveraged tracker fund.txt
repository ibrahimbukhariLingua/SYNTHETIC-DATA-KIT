UBS SDIC launches a leveraged tracker fund


The Singaporian Marc Tan has been appointed as CIO of UBS SDIC, a joint venture in which UBS controls 49% and the Chinese State Development and Investment Corp (SDIC) controls the remaining 51%, Asian Investor reports. UBS SDIC is also launching a tracker fund which will be traded on the Shenzhen stock exchange. It will replicate the CSI300 index (the most actively-traded shares in Shenzhen and Shanghai) for 95%, while the remaining 5% will replicate the local inter-bank interest rate. The product, whose net asset value will be calculated once per year, will employ 1.6 times leverage.
