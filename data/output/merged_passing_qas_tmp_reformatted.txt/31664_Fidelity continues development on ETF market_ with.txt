Fidelity continues development on ETF market, with the help of BlackRock


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Fidelity Investments is increasingly counting on BlackRock to grow on the ETF market. The number of iShares ETFs which may be traded with no commissions by Fidelity clients is expected to more than double to 65, according to a statement released on 13 March by Fidelity and BlackRock. iShares ETF will be used in managed accounts from Fidelity in the next few months, and BlackRock will help Fidelity to develop ETFs tied to sectoral strategies. In exchange, BlackRock may directly contact a larger number of US retail investors. BlackRock and Fidelity in 2010 agreed to distribute 25 iShares funds to Fidelity clients with no fees. The number of funds increased to 30 one year later. The 65 funds now available with no fees include the ten Core ETF funds from iShares launched in October, and vehicles which invest in other Us and international equities, bonds, and commodities.
