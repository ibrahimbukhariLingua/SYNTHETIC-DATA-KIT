Deutsche Bank: Sale of AM operation to be completed soon


Handelsblatt reports that, according to several sources familiar with the matter cited by Reuters, Guggenheim Partners and Deutsche Bank are new very close to an agreement to sell all asset management activities (excluding DWS in Europe and Asia) from Deutsche Bank to Guggenheim for an estimated total nearer to EUR1.5bn than to EUR2bn.The legal terms of the separation need to be ironed out, and financing needs to be finalised for the acquisition of the unit, with EUR400bn in assets. It appears that Deutsche Bank will agree to make payments to the buyer if revenues are not as high as expected.Kevin Parker, head of the division, who will be leaving Deutsche Bank in June, has had a determining role in the negotiations, and is hoping to be kept on by Guggenheim after the acquisition.
