Turquoise launches a segment for very high quality ETFs with Koris International


The investment advising firm Koris International is expected to announce this Tuesday that it has signed a cooperational agreement with Turquoise Global Holdings Limited, which grants the multilateral trading platform from the London Stock Exchange an exclusive operating license for a list of the best ETFs in the market, the TrackInsight A-list, to create a special market segment dedicated to ETFs, entitled Turquoise TrackInsight.The new market segment will accept the best-rated European ETFs, meaning those with a rating of three stars or more from TrackInsight, amounting to about 150 products, not to be confused with the 200 largest ETFs, which represent 97% of trading volume, but which are not necessarily among the best-rated ETFs. Turquoise is also negotiating agreements with six market-makers to provide selection of the products with the best liquidity.Turquoise TrackInsight will allow investors access to a transparent order bood, as well as a dark pool from Turquoise, and to its Turquoise Uncross block market. The new market segment may be launched within the next two to three months.
