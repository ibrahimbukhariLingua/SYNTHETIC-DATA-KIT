Threadneedle fills vacancies left by departures to RWC


Threadneedle has appointed Quentin Fitzsimmons as lead manager for two bond funds, the Threadneedle Absolute Return Bond and Target Return funds, previously managed by Peter Annwright and Stuart Frost, who have recently left the firm to join RWC. Fitzsimmons, who has been head of government bonds since 2003, made significant contributions to the growth of absolute return strategies, and it would be an exaggeration to attribute the success of these strategies solely to the two managers who have moved to RWC, Threadneedle says in a statement. Assets in the two funds concerned totalled over EUR2.3bn as of the end of March, within fixed income (EUR22bn in assets under management in total). Threadneedle has also recruited Vladimir Gerasimia, who will join the team specialised in emerging market debts, a,dn who previously worked at Fortis Investments. Another new arrival, Richard Stevens, previously of Old Mutual Asset Managers, joins the government bond team.
