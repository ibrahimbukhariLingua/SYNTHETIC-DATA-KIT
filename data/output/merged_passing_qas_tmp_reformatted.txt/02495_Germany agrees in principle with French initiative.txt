Germany agrees in principle with French initiative to limit bonuses


L’Agefi reports that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has stated that she is “galled by the return of bonus practices at financial establishments,” and lent her broad support to the position of French president Nicholas Sarkozy, on a visit to Berlin on Monday. “We cannot allow the question of bonuses at banks to continue as before,” the Chancellor said, emphasizing her agreement with the French proposal to forbid guaranteed bonuses and to require them to be paid out in instalments over time, although she is more guarded about her support for a limitation on the amounts of bonuses.
