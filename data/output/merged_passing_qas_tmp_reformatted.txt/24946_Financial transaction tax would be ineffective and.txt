Financial transaction tax would be ineffective and counter-productive


In the wake of the Paris Europlace conference (see Newsmanagers of 9 January 2012), the French banking federation (FBF) has become the next entity to declare its opposition to a planned tax on financial transactions advocated by the French government. If a tax on financial transactions were introduced, it would have to be applied internationally, and theoretically globally, the professional association says in a statement, claiming that a “tax on financial transactions which was applied only in France would weigh on growth, would result in a loss of competitiveness, and would represent a significant handicap for financing to the entire French economy.” Such a tax, which would come in addition to numerous more specific taxes already in effect, would increase the cost of financial operations to a point that “on the one hand, it would drive actors to move a large part of their operations currently undertaken in Paris to other financial centres, and on the other hand, it would prevent the installation of new actors to finance the economy in our country.” In other words, at a time when the priority should be to allow the French financial sector to finance the economy by adapting to new, very strict regulations, in a highly degraded environment, “a purely national tax which rapidly produced negative effects would be very counter-productive,” the FBF claims.
