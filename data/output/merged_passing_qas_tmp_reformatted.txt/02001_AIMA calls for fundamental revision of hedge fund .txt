AIMA calls for fundamental revision of hedge fund directive


Andrew Baker, CEO of the alternative management association (AIMA), says the AIFM hedge fund directive should focus on three key issues: registration and licensing, systematic reporting of pertinent information, and a practical European passport for management firms. Baker made the declaration on Thursday, as the professional association published its position paper on the draft directive and a newsletter for European politicians.
