EDHEC: Five strategies out of 13 show losses in October


Last month, the CTA Global strategy was the one of the 13 strategies monitored by EDHEC-Risk which showed the heaviest losses, at 1.39%. Long/short equity funds lost 0.94%, while three other strategies showed marginal losses: 0.12% for equity market neutral, 0.05% for funds of hedge funds, and 0.04% for global macro. The strongest performance, meanwhile, was for dedicated short bias, at 3.40%, followed by fixed income arbitrage (1.94%). For the first ten months of the year, only two strategies are still in the red. They are dedicated short bias (-15.3%), and CTA Global (-2.5%). However, the strongest gains were for convertible arbitrage, at 42.7%, and emerging markets (+32.8%). Since January 2001, the best results were for emerging markets, with annual performance of 12.3%, followed by distressed securities (10.6%).
