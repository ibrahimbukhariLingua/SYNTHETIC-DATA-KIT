Money market funds will see a decline in their assets


Global money market funds will lost one third of their assets under management next year under the combined effects of low interest rates and new regulations, the Financial Times reports. Reforms to the industry in the United States and Europe may trigger outflows of at least 30%, according to Moodyâ€™s. Small and mid-sized funds will be the worst affected.
