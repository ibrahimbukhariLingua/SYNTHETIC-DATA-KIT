Deutsche Bank to acquire 100% of Sal. Oppenheim holding company


According to reports in Die Welt, it will be announced on Wednesday afternoon that Detusche Bank will acquire all shares in the Luxembourg holding company of Sal. Oppenheim for about EUR1bn. Sal. Oppenheim will retain only slightly over 75% of a shareholder-governed (KGaA) company which oversees operational activities, while slightly less than 25% would remain in the hands of the current owners. This arrangement is the most tax-effective for all parties. Die Welt states that the former owners will earn bonuses in proportion to the number of clients who choose to remain loyal to the firm.
