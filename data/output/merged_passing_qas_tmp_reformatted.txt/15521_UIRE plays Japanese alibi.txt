UIRE plays Japanese alibi


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Union Investment Real Estate (UIRE) has frozen subscriptions and redemptions for its open-ended real estate fund UniImmo: Global, on the grounds that 14% of the properties in the portfolio of the fund are in Japan, and cannot now be valued. The move surprised and irritated the industry, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports, pointing out that the closure should be viewed in context: the net asset value of the fund was lowered in February by 4.5%, which triggered net outflows, bringing assets in the fund down to EUR2bn from EUR2.3bn at the end of January.Some managers estimate that UIRE must have been anticipating a closure due to these high levels of redemptions, in order to avoid a further deterioration in the fundâ€™s liquidity levels.
