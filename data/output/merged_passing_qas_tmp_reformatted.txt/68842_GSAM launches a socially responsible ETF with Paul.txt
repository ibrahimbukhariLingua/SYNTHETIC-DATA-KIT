GSAM launches a socially responsible ETF with Paul Jones Tudor


Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) is launching JUST, an ETF which seeks to offer exposure to US large caps, focusing on companies which have “just” behaviour, measured by JUST capital, an association founded and led by Paul Jones Tudor. The ETF tracks the Just U.S. Large Cap Diversified index, constructed by JUST Capital.The index seeks to identify buinesses of the Russell 1000 index with higher than average ratings for environmental, social and govrnance criteria valued by Americans. Companies which have belonged to the index historically have on average paid employees better, created more jobs, given twice as much to charity, emitted less greenhouse gases, and had a higher return on equity (ROE) than the rest of the Russell 1000 index, a statement says.GSAM began launching ETFs in September 2015, and now has 12 products, with USD8bn in assets as of 11 June 2018.
