US investors avoiding equities markets


Fewer Americans are holding investments in equities: currently, 54% have investments in shares either directly or indirectly (via investment organisms, retirement savings plans, or pension funds), according to a survey undertaken by the Gallup institute, Les Echos reports. The decline has been constant since the beginning of the subprime crisis: the percentage has fallen from 65% in April 2007, to 57% in 2009, and 54% this month. Retail investorsâ€™ lack of love for stock markets is even more visible in France. According to the most recent quarterly barometer by TNS Sofres for Les Echos and La Banque Postale, only 4% of French respondents say they would be prepared to invest in equities in December, a level not seen since at least 2001.
