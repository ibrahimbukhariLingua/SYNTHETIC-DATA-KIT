Frankfurt Trust launches a second ETF fund


Due to strong demand in private banking, where clients were demanding a more conservative product than the FT MultiAsset VolaTarget 9 (see Newsmanagers of 16 March), Frankfurt Trust (BHF-Bank) on Thursday launched the FT MultiAsset VolaTarget 5, another multi-asset class ETF (equities, bonds, commodities, private equity, real estate, and money markets), with a more defensive volatility objective, of 5 instead of 9. The product is managed by Christoph Kind and Corinne Ament, like the Target 9. ETF and ETC products will be used largely to hedge positions.
