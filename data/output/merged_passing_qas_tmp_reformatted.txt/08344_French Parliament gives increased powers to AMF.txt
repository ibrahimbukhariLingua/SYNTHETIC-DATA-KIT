French Parliament gives increased powers to AMF


Les Echos reports that the Finance committee of the French National Assembly on Tuesday evening approved a series of amendments to the banking and financial regulation bill. In the chapter on short-selling, an amendment which was unanimously approved now extends powers to the regulatory body AMF not only over completed transactions, but also over positions held by market actors. The identification of these positions will allow regulators to identify short positions and to suspend potential violators of bans. In order to further limit short-selling, legislators shortened the deadline for settlement of completed transactions by two days, to a maximum of one day after the transaction. They also extended the coercive powers of the market watchdog. The amendment multiplies the maximum fines the AMF has the power to hand out by a factor of ten, to EUR100m.
