Wallenberg and Vekselberg want to buy Metco


The Metco division of the Sulzer group, which is up for sale, has attracted two interested candidates, OC Oerlikon, led by the Russian Viktor Vekselberg, and the EQT holding company of the Swedish Wallenberg investment group, HandelsZeitung reports. The newspaper reveals that the adviser to EQT is Ulf Berg, formerly head and chairman of the board of director at Sulzer. Berg left Sulzer after a shareholder battle which was won by Vekselberg, it says. Metco is a very profitable division of Sulzer, active in the treatment of surfaces. Its sale is expected to bring in about CHF900m for Sulzer. Bids may be submitted until 18 January.
