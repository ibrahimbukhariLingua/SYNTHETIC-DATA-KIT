Sarasin CEO defends banking confidentiality


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, the CEO of the Swiss private bank Sarasin, Joachim Strähle, defends banking confidentiality. “I remain a partisan in favour of banking confidentiality. There is no reason for the entire world to know something as personal as your financial situation. In the same way that a doctor should not disclose information concerning you, a banker should not do so either,” he says. Switzerland, confronted with an unprecedented assault on banking confidentiality, will have to retain its position as a destination for private wealth. “I do not agree with those who think that the Swiss financial centre is dead of banking confidentiality is more or less eliminated. I think that Switzerland has a stable political system, an economy that has proven itself in the crisis, an active and highly-trained population, which often speaks several languages, and a long history of banking. These are qualities that other countries don’t have,” Strähle continues. Strähle also says that net inflows at the bank in second half remained at the levels observed in first half. Net inflows totalled CHF6.41bn in firts half. Sarasin will present its annual results on 24 February.
