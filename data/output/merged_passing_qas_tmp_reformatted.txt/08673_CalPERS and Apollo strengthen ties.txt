CalPERS and Apollo strengthen ties


The California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) and the alternative management firm Apollo Global Management on 19 April announced that they have signed a new agreement on strategic relations which aligns the interests of the two establishments. According to the statement, the initiative may represent “a new model of referenced for pension funds and their investment advisors.” The agreement sets out substantial reductions in commissions, of USD125m in the next five years, on funds which Apollo manages or may manage in the future, an offer made available exclusively to CalPERS. The agreement also makes a long-standing relationship (of 15 years) between CalPERS and Apollo, which manages most of the pension fund’s alternative management portfolio, a permanent fixture.
