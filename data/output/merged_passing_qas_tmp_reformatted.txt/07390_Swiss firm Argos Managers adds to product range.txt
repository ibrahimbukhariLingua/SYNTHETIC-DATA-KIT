Swiss firm Argos Managers adds to product range


The Swiss specialist in European small caps, Argos Managers, is planning to add to its product range. With this in view, the firm, which has barely CHF200m in assets under management, has recruited Jean Keller, who spent six years as head of 3A, the alternative management firm from Syz & Co. Keller will join Argos Managers in February, as a partner. In the meanwhile, he will continue to act as chair of several committees at 3A. But from the month of February, he will move to Argos Managers, and will work to build the product range at the Geneva-based management firm, which is largely known for its Argonaut fund. “I think it is a propitious time for small specialised structures, when investors are looking for value,” says Keller, who was head of asset management at Lombard Odier before joining 3A in 2005.
