La Financière de L’Echiquier adds to systematic management range


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } La Financière de L’Echiquier has added to its range of funds with an “innovative” investment solution, by its own terms, managed systematically, whose objective is to earn returns which are decorrelated from those of traditional assets. “This new diversification strategy, which exists in a version for professional investors which has been in operation for three years (Echiquier QME Global; QME: Quantitative Multi Edge), and another one in UCITS format for retail investors (Echiquier QME), enriches the historic area of expertise at LFDE with a new quantitative approach,” the firm says in a statement. Echiquier QME will use a systematic quantitative management methodology whose objective will be to earn gains in both market directions (rising and falling) as well as in markets with no trends, with average annual volatility below 10%. The fund invests in future type contracts, distributed over four asset classes for the UCITS version (indices of equities, government bonds, interest rates, and currencies), in addition to which commodities are added for the Echiquier QME Global version. The investment process, oriented to risk control, is implemented systematically through proprietary quantitative models, which make it possible to “ally two complementary strategies,” meaning momentum strategies, which account for about 70% of the portfolio, and satellite strategies, whose algorithms represent about 30% of the allocation of the portfolio. The Echiquier QME fund is managed by a team of two people - Ludovic Berthe and Alexis Grutter – who joined LFDE in 2013.
