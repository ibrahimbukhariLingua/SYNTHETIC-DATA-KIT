Acropole AM takes aim at wealth management clients with a new fund of funds


Acropole Asset Management this summer launched Acropole Patrimoine, a fund of funds developed on the basis of eight funds of its product range, with three allocations, to convertibles, credit and absolute returns. The asset management firm specialised in convertible bonds is planning to use the product as a bridgehead to retail clients, via private banks and independent financial advisers. Virtually all of its assets have hitherto come from institutional clients, who are more familiar with this relatively technical asset class. Acropole AM now holds a 7% market share in convertible bonds. But with the arrival of new competitors in this asset class, which is largely a province of institutional investors, the asset management firm needs to turn to new sales outlets for its products. It is hoping to bring in up to EUR50m for Acropole Patrimoine in the next 18 to 24 months. After a first foray into the French retail market, Acropole AM will next attach the European retail market, with this fund as the advance guard. Acropole AM currently has slightly under EUR800m in assets under management. “Net inflows have totalled EUR50m since the beginning of the year, while market effects have also come to EUR50m,” says Jacques Joakimides, chairman of the asset management firm.
