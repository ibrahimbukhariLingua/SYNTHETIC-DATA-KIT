Threadneedle launches a contrarian US fund


Threadneedle Investments has launched the Threadneedle (Lux) US Contrarian Core Equities Fund in its Luxembourg SICAV range. The fund is managed by Guy W Pope, managing director and senior portfolio manager at Columbia Management, fellow asset management subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial. The Threadneedle (Lux) US Contrarian Core Equities Fund is managed with the same approach as the USD1.6bn Columbia Management Contrarian Core Fund which seeks out of favour income and growth stocks. Guy W Pope, along with his associate portfolio manager, Harvey Liu, use their proprietary screening method to find large cap US stocks which are in the bottom third of their 52-week price range. This leads to stocks being identified where it is felt that the price undervalues the company. The portfolio is constructed to seek above average returns whilst balancing risk and rewards. Guy W Pope commented: “This fund is all about pessimism – we are looking for those companies that have fallen out of favour due to undue pessimism about their future.” The investment approach is to be offered to clients in Europe, the UK and Asia. The fund has been registered with the CSSF in Luxembourg and the AFM in the Netherlands and registration is pending in other jurisdictions.
