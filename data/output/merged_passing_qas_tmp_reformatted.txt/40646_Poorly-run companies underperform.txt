Poorly-run companies underperform


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Companies which are well-managed have outperformed those which were not well-managed by an average of 30 basis points per month since the beginning of 2009, according to a study by Hermes Fund Managers cited by IPE.com. More precisely, businesses with the lowest governance ratings tended to underperform on average, rather than the inverse. Geir Lode, head of quantitative equities at Hermes, comments: “our results show that it is poor governance which has led to underperformance, rather than good governance which has led to outperformance.”
