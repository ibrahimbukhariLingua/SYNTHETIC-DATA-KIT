Swiss &amp; Global loses its chief investment officer


As a result of the recently-announced reorganisation of GAM Holding (see Newsmanagers of 16 January), Stefan Angele is leaving his job as head investment management at Swiss and Global, the asset management firm has confirmed to finews. The chief investment officers in four sectors (bonds, equities, multi-asset class and commodities) now report directly to CEO David Solo, meaning that the position held by Angele now becomes redundant.
