United States - Under Barack Obama, sustainability rating of US may improve


According to Oliver Rüdel, director of research at oekom research, if Barack Obama keeps his campaign promises, the United States may gain several places in the global sustainability rankings. The country currently ranks 40th out of 50. Among the areas which are likely to raise the overall rating of US government bonds are the closure of the Guantanamo detention centre, the abolition of torture, withdrawal from Iraq, ratification of the Kyoto protocol, the development and use of sources of renewable energy, and investment in infrastructure.However, Rüdel is sceptical that the United States will succeed in catching up with the countries of Europe in terms of sustainability during Obama’s first term. Currently, the country ranks just ahead of Turkey (41st) and after Mexico (39th). The top places on the list belong to, in order, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Austria, Germany, while France is 11th and the United Kingdom is 18th.
