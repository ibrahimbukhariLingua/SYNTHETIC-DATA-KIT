Central banks cool investor appetite for equity funds in early June


The US Federal Reserve does not appear to be in a hurry to enter a new phase of quantitative easing, at a time when the European Central Bank has implied that it may raise its rates in July, so that investors rolled their portfolios over into bonds in the first days of June. According to the most recent estimates by EPFR Grlobal, bond funds attracted a net total of USD5.98bn in the week to 8 June. Money market funds, for their part, have posted net inflows of over USD26bn, while equity funds saw outfllows of USD7.74bn. Funds dedicated to US equities, in particular, have posted their heaviest outflows since mid-August 2010. Inflows to European equities remained positive, with inflows of USD236m in the week to 8 June. However, institutional engagements have gone mostly to German equities in 2011. Now counting flows which have totalled over USD6bn since the beginning of the year, European equity funds have seen outflows of over USD1.5bn. Diversified funds posted net inflows of USD219m, which brings inflows since the beginning of the year to over USD15.3bn.
