SEC proposes creation of single database for market transactions


The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 26 May proposed the creation of a single database for all market transactions in the United States. The standardised and automated system would amass data from various participants, allowing regulators to very rapidly reconstruct the flow of orders on the market. The absence of such a system was highlighted by regulators as a reason that it was difficult to determine the exact cause of the brutal drop on the New York Stock Exchange on 6 May.
