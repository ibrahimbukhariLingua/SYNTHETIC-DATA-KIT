CalPERS building up stockpile of candidates for board positions


The pension fund CalPERS (USD200bn) is in the process of recruiting a number of directors, in order to have them on hand when it needs to nominate candidates for positions on the boards of directors at companies in which the fund is invested when they are reporting poor results, the Wall Street Journal reports. The 3D (Diverse Director Database) is being created ahead of changes soon to come to the rules governing the composition of boards of directors. The new rules will give CalPERS and other investors more influence over the composition of these boards. Anne Simpson, head of corporate governance, says that to be included in the new CalPERS database, in addition to a position as a major point of reference in management, finance and sectoral expertise, candidates should also belong to groups which have been historically underrepresented on boards, such as women and minorities.
