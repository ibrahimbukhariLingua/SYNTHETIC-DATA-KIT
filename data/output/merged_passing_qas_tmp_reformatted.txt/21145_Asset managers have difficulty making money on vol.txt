Asset managers have difficulty making money on volatility


Market volatility and the correlation of new asset classes which have followed the credit crunch of 2008 are not going away soon – at least because the sovereign debt crisis is taking out a loan against future growth.According to an international study of institutional investors undertaken by Create Research and Global Investors, nearly 80% of institutionals are expecting extended turbulence on the markets, and over 60% of them are expecting at least two systemic crises before the end of the decade. Fear, more than fundamentals, will guide the behaviour of the markets, and price anomalies will prosper.Such anomalies will, of course, represent a source of opportunity, a point of view shared by 71% of respondents. However, only 13% of investors surveyed think they will be able to profit from this volatile environment in the next few years.According to the survey, several obstacles are preventing asset managers from profiting from the situation. The sector cruelly lacks managers able to more deeply understand risk premiums, asset correlations and tactical bias in periods of dislocation. In 2009, the survey finds, only a minority of asset managers had drawn lessons from the financial crisis.Global comprehension of these phenomena is more difficult in light of the rising number of specialist mandates to the detriment of diversified mandates. Other obstacle identified by the survey include client mistrust due to moediocre performance in the wake of the crisis, and gregarious instincts of investors, who often fail to remember the basic precept “buy to the sound of the cannon, sell to the sound of the violin.”The consequence of this situation is that a considerable number of asset managers will need to revise their development model if they want to make volatility an investment opportunity.Among the areas for development identified by the study are development of multi-asset class expertise, improved distribution of interests, involving investment professionals, and associated not only with gains but also with losses, the promotion of rapid execution, and conviction investment, and finally, promotion of inceased client engagement, to reduce timing errors and regret risks. This is the price to pay, if the sector is to move away from looking into a lost decade.
