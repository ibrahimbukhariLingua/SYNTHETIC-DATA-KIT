Funds of hedge funds need to reinvent themselves, according to Fitch


Fitch claims multi-strategy funds of hedge funds need to reinvent themselves to make investors forget their poor performance in 2008, Le Temps reports. The ratings agency warns that these products need to first make their liquidity terms more generous, and adjust the terms of sale. Fitch also recommends that portfolio managers “be prepared to adjust tactical allocations, using tools such as hedge fund clones or derivatives,” Le Temps reports.
