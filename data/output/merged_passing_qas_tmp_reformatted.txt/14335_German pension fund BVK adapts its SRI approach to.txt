German pension fund BVK adapts its SRI approach to each asset class


The largest German pension fund, Bayerische Versorgungskammer (BVK), which manages about EUR54bn in assets, claims that there can be no such thing as a general approach to SRI investment, Citywire Global reports.Each asset class has distinctive traits, and responsible investment strategies need to be adapted to each of them. In April this year, the pension fund announced plans to roll out SRI strategies for its entire portfolio, and also signed the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI).The head of asset management for the pension fund, André Heimrich, has announced that the group has opted for an engagement strategy, and adds that it is not possible to have a one-size-fits-all approach in this area. “It is impossible to have a general SRI approach for all asset classes,” says Heimrich. “A differentiated approach is necessary, since asset classes are very different from one another. For example, in fixed income, it is not possible to have direct engagement. You are required to take a different approach. We have therefore defined our own vision of the best possible approach for each asset class,” Heimrich says.This goes for bond investments as well, which represent about 65% of the total portfolio, and for which the pension fund uses SRI ratings from the oekom research agency to analyse each of its bond investments on the basis of criteria such as transparency.
