IORP directive: industry raises its voice


The revised IORP directive for pension funds is a highly political subject, which merits that the voices of all participants be heard, a joint statement released on 23 October by the European fund and asset management association (EFAMA) and several other European professional organisations, including the European venture capital association (EVCA), the confederation of European labour unions (CES), the European association of joint associations (AEIP) and Business Europe states.The signatories of the statement are: the European association of joint associations (AEIP), the European centre for businesses for public participation and businesses in the general economic interest (CEEP), Business Europe, the European fund and asset management association (EFAMA), the European retirement federation (EFRP), the confederation of European labour unions (CES or ETUC), the European venture capital association (EVCA) and the European union of artisans and small and mid-sized businesses.At a time when the European Commission and the European insurance and professional pensions authority (EIOPA) are continuing their work to prepare a revision to the IORP directive, the professional associations raise the question of the legitimacy of the quantitative impact study, the first as part of the revision process for the directive, which is based on a tool which the associations contest, known as the Holistic Balance Sheet (HBS).“We are concerned that the result of this process will be to impose a Solvency 2 framework for surveillance of pension funds. Our concerns were reinforced in July 2012, following a public consultation launched by Eiopa into the planned technical specifications of the impact study,” the associations claim, noting with satisfaction that EIOPA has admitted that the use of the holistic tool required refinement in several points, and expressing regret at the same time that the Commission was unable to identify these problems.The professional associations call on the European Commission to integrate the results of the debates currently ongoing on the subject of long-term investments into the new incarnation of the directive, in order to allow pension organisations to continue to finance their long-term investments. Currently, the associations regret, it would appear that the planned revision privileges security in the short term, to the detriment of long-term investment and viability of retirement regimes. “It is certainly important to ensure a good balance between security and investment, but it is also important to avoid contradictory processes developing within the European Commission,” the associations write.
