Oddo &amp; Cie seeks to reassure teams at Banque d’Orsay


At a press conference to discuss the 20-year partnership between the independent financial advising firm Oddo & Cie and the management firm Banque d’Orsay, Philippe Oddo, managing partner at Oddo & Cie, confirmed that the recent acquisition of the Banque d’Orsay will give the partnership higher ambitions in terms of growth. Without exception, the logic of the operation is not to realise economies of scale, but rather, for teams at Banque d’Orsay, to enrich the product range and integration. “The teams at Banque d’Orsay are worried, and logically so,” Oddo noted. “We would also like to tell them that we would like to work with them.” After the departure last week of one of the more experienced heads of distribution from Oddo & Cie, Philippe Louisadat (see Newsmanagers of 10/09/10), Oddo confirmed that he would naturally consider staff at Banque d’Orsay before appointing a replacement.
