Major UK banking reforms in the works


The Independent Commission on Banking (ICB) on 11 April published its interim report on the British banking system, at the request of the government. The commission, led by the economist Sir John Vickers, recommends a separation of retail banking and investment banking activities in a document of over 200 pages, without making any definitive statements about the details of the separation. Rather than a structural radicalism, which would require the universal banking model to be dismantled, or a laisser-faire policy which would require much higher levels of owners’ equity at banks, the Commission estimates that “the most effective policy is probably a combination of more moderate measures in terms of absorption of risks or structures.” The report recommends increasing the owners’ equity ratio from 7% currently to 10% for banks which present systemic risks, and for major British retail banks. In structural terms, the report suggests that an entity protected by taxpayer money should be created, distinct from the larger entity, and with its own share of owners’ equity. The report will now be submitted to a period of consultation of several months, which will likely be very active. The Commission will submit its final report to the government in September.
