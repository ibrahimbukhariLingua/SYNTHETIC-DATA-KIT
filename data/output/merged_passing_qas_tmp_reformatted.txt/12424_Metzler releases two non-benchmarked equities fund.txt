Metzler releases two non-benchmarked equities funds


Metzler Asset Management has announced that at the end of August it received a sales license from BaFin (Germany) and the FMA (Austria) for two Irish-registered funds specialised in equities, with concentrated portfolios of 30 positions. The products have no benchmark index, and are unconstrained in matter of portfolio construction.The first of the two, Metzler European Concentrated Growth (IE00B5T6MG33), invests primarily in high-quality large caps whose growth potential has been underestimated by the market, and which have limited exposure to the economic cycle.The second, Metzler European Small and Micro Cap (IE00B5M17487), focuses in European small and midcaps, mostly companies with capitalisation sizes of under EUR500m, with a maximum of EUR1bn.In both cases, the front-end fee and management commission are set at 5% and 1.8%, respectively.
