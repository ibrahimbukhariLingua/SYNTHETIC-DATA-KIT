Mandarine PMB fund becomes Mandarine Europe Microcap


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The asset management firm Mandarine Gestion has renamed its Mandarine PME fund, which on 1 September became Mandarine Europe Microcap. The equity fund is specialised in the selection of European microcaps, meaning publicly-traded busiensses with a market capitalisation of less than about USD800m. Its benchmark indicator is now the MSCI Europe Microcap NR. The former benchmark had been the Stoxx Europe Small 200 DR (net dividends reinvested), until 31 August. Mandarine Europe Microcap, managed by Sébastien Lagarde, who has over 10 years of experience on the market and joined Mandarine in May last year, offers access to an attractive investment universe, which allows investors to diversify their exposure to the European equity universe. “Contrary to conventional wisdom, the very great economic diversity of microcaps means that they have limited correlation between them, which makes for a less volatile universe than large caps,” Lagarde, manager of the Mandarine Europe Microcap, explained on 14 September at a press conference. “With its European prism, the new funds is expected to interest many more investors,” Lagarde says, adding that he has a very good track record since he had managed a similar strategy at AXA Investment Managers before joining Mandarine. Assets under management in the fund now total slightly under EUR11m, with an essentially retail investor population. A European perimter will allow for the circle of investors to be enlarged, particularly in Germany, where funds of funds and family offices are very interested in the strategy And if inflows develop favourable, institutionals are expected to join the fund.
