Falcon Private Bank aims for CHF20bn in assets under management


The Falcon Private Bank is hoping to top CHF20bn in assets under management by the end of next year, due to a repositioning of the bank to focus on high net worth clients in China, Agefi Switzerland reports. Assets under management at the bank, which is indirectly owned by the sovereign fund IPIC, based in Abu Dhabi, currently total about CHF12bn. “We are now actively profiling ourselves to investors with CHF2m to CHF20m from China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Scandinavia and of course the Middle East,” Heiner Weber, head of commercial development at the private bank, tells the newspaper.
