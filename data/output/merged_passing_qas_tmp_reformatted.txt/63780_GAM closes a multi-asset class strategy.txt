GAM closes a multi-asset class strategy


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Swiss asset management firm GAM has decided to finally close its JB (CH) Defender Asset Allocation fund, a multi-asset class strategy, Citywire Switzerland reports. The fund was managed by Michael Zbinden, who left the firm in mid-January 2017. The decision was taken due to a similarity of the strategy with the two Star Target Return and Star Target Return Plus strategies, launched in April 2016, and supervised by Larry Hatheway, head of multi-asset class portfolios and economist in chief. According to a spokesperson for GAM, cited by Citywire, the two strategies offer more flexibility to implement long/short investment ideas than the JB (CH) Defender Asset Allocation fund. The fund had invested in assets, securities and short-term liquidity, with options to invest in commodities and real estate.
