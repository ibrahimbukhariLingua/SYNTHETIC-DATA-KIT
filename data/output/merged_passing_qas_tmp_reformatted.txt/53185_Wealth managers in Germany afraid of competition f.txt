Wealth managers in Germany afraid of competition from fintechs


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Fintechs are raising fears in Germany. 86% of wealth managers surveyed by the financial research company Verdict Financial expect a loss of market share in the high net worth segment to robo-advisors in the next two years. Verdict Financial estimates that in developed markets, Germany is where high net worth clients are showing the most interest in automated investment. The country ranks 5th worldwide in all markets, after the Philippines, Brazil, India and China. The main argument in favour of automated management appears to be having a way to reallocate portfolios without too many complicated actions, Verdict Financial finds. Internationally, robo-advisors have difficulty creating a presence for themselves among these highly demanding clients. In countries where robo-advising has been around longest, such as the United States or the United Kingdom, high net worth individuals represent a small portion of all clients.
