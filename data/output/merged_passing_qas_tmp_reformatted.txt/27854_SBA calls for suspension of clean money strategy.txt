SBA calls for suspension of clean money strategy


The Swiss Bankers Association called on September 3 for the clean money strategy to be dropped. The industry wants to help to shape international standards in future, and comply with them."We bear the sole responsibility in the coming years for acting in such a way that we live up to our responsibility to clients, staff, the economy, society and the next generation of bankers,» said Patrick Odier, Chairman of the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA), at the annual media conference before the Swiss Bankers Day in Zurich.He noted that banks had adapted their strategy to the new operating environment: «Our strategy can be summed up in the words tax compliance, international standards, growth through open markets and fair competition."The SBA also clearly rejects an excessive Swiss finish to regulation.Patrick Odier expressed optimism for the future, based on the good economic starting point the banks enjoy, and the fact that developing and expanding new business areas such as asset management, trade financing and renminbi services will allow the financial centre to grow over the long term.
