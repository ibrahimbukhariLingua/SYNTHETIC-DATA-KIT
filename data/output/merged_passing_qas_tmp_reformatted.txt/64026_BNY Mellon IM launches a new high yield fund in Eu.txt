BNY Mellon IM launches a new high yield fund in Europe


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } BNY Mellon Investment Management (BNY Mellon IM) on Thursday, 12 January announced that it has launched the BNY Mellon Global Short-Dated High Yield Bond fund, aimed at European investors. The new vehicle is based on a low-volatility strategy already on offer from Insight Investment, one of the boutiques from BNY Mellon IM, which aims to confront widening spreads and rising interest rates. The new fund, a sub-fund of the Irish Sicav BNY Global Funds UCITS, is based on an actively-managed bond strategy. Its objective is to outperform the Libor by investing primarily in a portfolio composed of high yield and short duration bonds, convertible bonds, loans, asset-backed securities (ABS), and also the selective sale of credit default swaps (CDS), with the objective of diversification, the asset management firm says in a statement. The fund is managed by Ulrich Gerhard, senior management on the bond management team at Insight Investment. “Since its launch, the strategy has generated annual returns of 6.15%, as well as positive performance each year,” BNY Mellon IM states. The fund is licensed for sale in France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. It will also be licensed for sale in Switzerland and Portugal.
