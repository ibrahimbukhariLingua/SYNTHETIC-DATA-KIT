Performance of emerging market debt funds lacks persistence


Emerging market debt funds’ performance has been heterogeneous and shows a lack of persistency, according to Fitch Ratings. Only 11% of funds stay in first or second quartile performance in both the periods 2005-2008 and 2008-2011. Worse, around 20% of funds moved from top quartile to bottom quartile (and vice versa) over the same periods. «The lack of consistency in performance reflects fund managers’ difficulties in adapting style and exposure to changing market regimes: EMD funds investments remain a beta play,» says Manuel Arrive, senior director in Fitch’s Fund and Asset Manager Rating team. Flows to emerging market debt funds have been solid in 2011 attracting USD28bn (and USD13bn for the first two months of 2012), pushing the sector’s assets under management to USD279bn as at the end of February 2012, according to Fitch. Local currency funds attracted about 64% of the flows in 2011. Emerging market debt benchmarked funds dominate the sector, with absolute return funds representing just 3% of total assets under management. Fitch expects to see more multi-strategy funds (absolute return or blended currency) or specialised corporate funds being launched in the next few months.
