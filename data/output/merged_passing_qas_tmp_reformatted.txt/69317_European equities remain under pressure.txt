European equities remain under pressure


The saga of the making of the new Italian government has greatly influenced the news in past days, and has helped keep investors away from all European equities. In the week to 23 May, funds dedicated to Italian equities have seen record redemptions, representing 6% of assets invested in this asset class, the weekly study from Bank of America Merrill Lynch reveals. Funds specialised in European equities overall have seen net outflows of USD2.6bn, for an 11th week of negative outflows. With the addition of European bond funds, divestments in the past week total about USD4.4bn, according to the study, based on data from the global flow monitoring specialist EPFR Global.Japanese equity funds have continued the trend of previous weeks and have posted significant net outflows of USD2.6bn. US equity funds have seen USD3.4bn in inflows, while emerging market equity funds have seen a miniscule USD0.1bn, as the enthusiasm of investors was rained on by rising US short-term interest rates, a rising US dollar and geopolitical tensions throughout the emerging markets universe. Overall, equity funds in all geographical regions combined completed the week with very modest USD0.5bn in inflows.In bonds, investors, who had been anticipating the minutes of the most recent meeting of the US Federal Reserve, adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the week ended with net outflows of USD1.5bn from funds in all categories combined. Aside from investment grade bonds, which saw redemptions totalling USD1.2bn, high yield bond and other emerging market bond funds also saw net redemptions of USD0.4bn and USD0.3bn, respectively.
