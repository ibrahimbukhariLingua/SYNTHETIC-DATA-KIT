Mirabaud rationalises Spanish fund range


Funds People reports that Antonio Palma, partner and CEO at Mirabaud, has announced that the group is in a redeployment phase in Spain, following its acquisition of Venture Finanzas. The changes will result in a single range of Spanish funds, which will be on sale throughout the group, and modernised to comply with the UCITS IV directive. This will involve discontinuations of products, a reshuffle, and changes to the management philosophy for some funds. The range will be made up of Spanish equity funds and one local money market product. European equity funds from Venture will be merged with the equivalent Mirabaud products. Meanwhile, Mirabaud will gradually register its funds with the CNMV.
