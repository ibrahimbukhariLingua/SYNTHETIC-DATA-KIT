Amundi may hold IPO by end 2015


Amundi is preparing to write a new page in its history. Crédit Agricole SA and Société Générale, shareholders in the asset management firm for 80% and 20% respectively, on 17 June announced a decision to set out plans to hold an initial public offering for their asset management joint venture, founded in 2010. The objective is to have the company listed on the stock exchange by the end of this year, subject to market conditions. “These plans will be presented to the employee representative bodies,” the two groups have said in a joint statement. With EUR954m in assets under management as of 31 March 2015, Amundi has in the space of five years become the leader for asset management in Europe, and is now among the top 10 players worldwide.According to the two banking groups, the public offering will ultimately “ensure the growth dynamic at Amundi and offer liquidity to Société Générale, which may sell as much as all of its stake, in line with the shareholders’ agreement put in place at the creation of Amundi.” However, “Amundi and Société Générale will continue their industrial partnership after the IPO,” Crédit Agricole and Société Générale say. Amundi will continue to be the provider of savings and investment products of reference for the networks of the retail bank and insurance activities of Société Générale, for a renewable five-year period. For its part, Crédit Agricole SA plans to retain majority control of Amundi, “which represents a key axis in its growth strategy.”
