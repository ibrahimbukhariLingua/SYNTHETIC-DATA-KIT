Deminor to sue UBS in Luxembourg


L’Echo reports that Deminor, an agency specialised in defending the interests of minority shareholders, may soon file a penal case in Luxembourg against UBS and Ernst & Young, in connection with the Madoff scandal. The case will hinge on the question of what contractual ties connected the depository bank (UBS Luxembourg) to the Luxalpha investment fund. “Our position is that UBS Luxembourg and Ernst & Young Luxembourg did not act as an ordinarily prudent and diligent bank and auditor would have done,” explains Edouard Fremault, senior analyst at Deminor. “We think UBS and Ernst & Young made misleading declarations to the financial sector supervisory commission (CSSF, the Luxembourg market regulator), when the Luxalpha fund was approved,” the analyst says.
