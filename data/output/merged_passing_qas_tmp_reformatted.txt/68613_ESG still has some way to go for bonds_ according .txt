ESG still has some way to go for bonds, according to PRI


Although an evaluation of governance criteria is nothing new in the analysis of credit risk, investors such as ratings agencies agree that taking into account environmental and social criteria and their impact on balance sheets and projections of cash flow requires more work, according to a report released by the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment, which presents the main conclusions from round tables organised by the PRI, in which credit and investment professionals and ratings agencies participate in dicussions of questions related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria («Shifting perceptions: ESG, credit risk and ratings - part 2: exploring the disconnects,” released to follow «Shifting perceptions: ESG, credit risk and ratings - part 1: the state of play,” published last year.)Participants agreed that it is not easy to identify the correct scope when taking ESG criteria into account in the analysis of credit risk. Due to the multi-dimensional nature of ESG criteria, difficulties when modelling data and taking the inter-dependency of data into account are cited among the major obstacles to the evaluation of ESG criteria. Expertise and resources are improving both for investors and for ratings agencies. Construction of a formal framework to ensure that credit analysts systematically take ESG criteria into account is now a project which requires further work.Communication and transparency in ESG issues has been limited until recently, partly due to a lack of awareness or engagement, but improvements are occurring presently. There are imbalances at various levels of the investment chain, not only between investors and ratings agencie, but also between owners of assets and asset managers, as well as bond issuers.“Although issuers and regulators are increasingly concentrating on the role of the bond mrket in supporting sustainable finance, the results of this report emphasise the importance of our initiative in developing knowledge and encouraging action,” says My-Linh Ngo, director of ESG risk management at BlueBay AM and chair of the PRI consulting committee on credit ratings.The third report, which will be released at the end of the year, will treat possible solutions which have begun to emerge over the course of talks. So far, more than 130 investment companies, with a total of over USD26trn in assets under management, have signed the ESG in Credit Ratings Statement, along with 15 ratings agencies, including the Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings, along with smaller specialist regional players.
