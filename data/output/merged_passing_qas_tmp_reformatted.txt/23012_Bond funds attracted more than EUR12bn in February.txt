Bond funds attracted more than EUR12bn in February


According to the most recent statistics from Morningstar, long-term funds domiciled in Europe in February posted net inflows of EUR15bn. Bond funds attracted the largest net subscriptions, with EUR12.54bn, the largest inflows for funds of this type since January 2010. Asset allocation and convertible bond funds also posted significant subscriptions, with EUR1.8bn and EUR68m, respectively. Equity funds have seen net redemptions of EUR189m, while money market funds had outflows of EUR13.36bn. Morningstar says investors are showing some pessimism about the markets, avoiding equity funds specialised on markets perceived as a risk (Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States), while the most popular equity funds are those focused on emerging markets and Asia. As of the end of February, BlackRock leads the rankings of the 10 largest asset management firms in terms of assets under long-term management, with EUR133bn, followed by UBS (EUR132bn) and Franklin Templeton (EUR109bn).
