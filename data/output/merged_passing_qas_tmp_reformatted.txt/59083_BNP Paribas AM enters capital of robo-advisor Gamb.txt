BNP Paribas AM enters capital of robo-advisor Gambit


BNP Paribas Asset Management (BNPP AM) yesterday announced the acquisition of a majority stake in the capital of Gambit Financial Solutions, a European provider of digital investment advising solutions. Through this operation, which is subject to the approval of the Luxembourg financial sector surveillance commission and insurance commissariat, the asset management firm acquires a “cutting-edge digital range” of investment advising for its distributor clients. “This operation, in line with its strategic objective for 2020, allows BNPP AM to enrich its range of innovative investment solutions,” the asset management firm explains in a statement. Gambit Financial Solutions, created in 2007 as a spinoff from the HEC-Université de Liège by scientists, is a Belgian fintech which has a range of interfaces to guide a client session assisted by an advisor or completely alone. The investment advising and customer experience digitalization solutions are largely aimed at financial institutions. The firm has recently added to its range with the launch of Birdee, its proprietary B2C robo-adviser. Solutions from Gambit are used by several private and retail banks, asset management firms and insurance companies in Belgium, Luxembourg, France and Switzerland, BNPP AM notes. To improve customer experience, BNP Paribas will deploy solutions from Gambit at its retail and private banking networks, which will associate “ergonomic user interfaces to guide a client session assisted by an advisor or completely alone,” the banking group notes. Under the partnership, Gambit will retain its autonomy from BNP Paribas, with its own governance and management team. This team is composed of Geoffroy de Schrevel, CEO; Laurent Bodson, COO; Gaël Minon, head of digital solutions; Séverine Plunus, administrative and financial director; and lastly, Ken Van Eesbeek, director of sales.
