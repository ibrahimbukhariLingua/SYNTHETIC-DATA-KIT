Insight to study government bond issues from ESG perspective


Insight Investment has developed a country rating model to explore how environment, social and governance - ‘ESG’ factors - affect sovereign debt portfolios. Insight’s rating model links sustainability and individual country risk, and responds to increased client interest in ESG portfolios. “Sovereign debt investors need more information to make informed decisions about the extent to which ESG factors are reflected in market prices,” said Joshua Kendall, senior ESG analyst at Insight. The model’s initial findings show most countries’ ESG performance has deteriorated and that governance in particular has been on a downward trend across more than half of developed market countries.
