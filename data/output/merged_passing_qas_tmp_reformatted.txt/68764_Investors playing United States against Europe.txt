Investors playing United States against Europe


With higher than average growth in the largest economy in the world, and with crucial meetings of the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan approaching, investors have clearly opted for US funds, particularly US equity funds, to the detriment of European and emerging market funds, in the second week of June. US equity funds in particular have attracted over USD10bn in the week to 13 June, according to a weekly study by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, based on data from the global flow evolution specialist EPFR Global.However, the outflows from European equity funds are continuing, at a pace of USD2.5bn in the past week. Over the past six weeks, US equity funds have attracted nearly USD30bn, while European equity funds have lost about USD13bn. In the past week, divestments are less significant from Japanese equity funds (-USD0.4bn) and from emerging market equity funds (-USD1.3bn). In all geographical regions combined, equity funds have posted net inflows of USD5.6bn, which break down as USD10.6bn in inflows to ETFs, and redemptions of nearly USD5bn from open funds.In bonds, the week ended with marginal net outflows of USD0.1bn. Investment grade bond funds attracted USD0.9bn, but high yield bond funds have seen a sixth week of net outflows, this time totalling USD0.6bn. In line with previous weeks, emerging market debt funds have seen net outflows of USD1.3bn. In the past seven weeks, outflows from emerging market equity and debt funds have totalled over USD12bn.
