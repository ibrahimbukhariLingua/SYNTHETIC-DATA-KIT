Belgium - Brussels may curtail banking confidentiality


Didier Reynders on Tuesday announced that Belgium favours increased transparency in the war on tax evasion, and that it is planning to increase its cooperation with EU partners, according to Reuters, relayed by Fondsprofessionell. The finance minister appears to be disposed to repeal banking confidentiality laws in Belgium, and says that it will not be a problem for his country to provide more information to other EU countries on foreign investors.
