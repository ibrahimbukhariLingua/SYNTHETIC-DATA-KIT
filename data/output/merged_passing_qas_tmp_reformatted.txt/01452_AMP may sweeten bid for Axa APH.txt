AMP may sweeten bid for Axa APH


Craig Dunn, CEO, has told the Wall Street Journal that the Australian wealth management firm AMP Holdings (AUD12bn in assets) may soon improve its bid for Axa Asia Pacific Holdings, over its previous offer of AUD5.34 in shares and cash. AMPâ€™s rise on the stock exchange has already driven up the value of the bid to about EUR5.72 per share.
