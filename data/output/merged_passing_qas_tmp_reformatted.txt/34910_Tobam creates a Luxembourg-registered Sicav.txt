Tobam creates a Luxembourg-registered Sicav


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Tobam, the asset management firm led by Yves Choueifaty, has transformed the 11 funds which make up its open-ended fund range (excluding dedicated funds) into sub-funds of a Luxembourg Sicav, Most Diversified Porfolio SICAV. The vehicle was created in mid-May 2014, in preparation for the migration of the funds which has now been performed. In an interview with Newsmanagers, Choueifaty explains that the changes are due to the distribution activity at the firm, “for which it still remains easier for a distributor in Asia to offer a Luxembourg-registered range, all the more so since Luxembourg is a more fiscally stable country than France, and offers better visibility.’ Choueifaty also indicates that Tobam may in the future manage funds which comply with other regulations. UCITS funds will be systematically regrouped into the Luxembourg format, but may alternately follow Aisan or Canadian regulations, as the asset management firm is currently at work on projects in the latter country.
