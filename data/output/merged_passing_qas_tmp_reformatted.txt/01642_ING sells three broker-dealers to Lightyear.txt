ING sells three broker-dealers to Lightyear


ING has sold three of its broker-dealer locations in the United States, and their holding company, ING Brokers Network, for an undisclosed amount to the private equity investor Lightyear Capital LLC, which manages about USD3bn. The broker-dealers are Financial Network Investment Corporation, located in El Segundo, California, Multi-Financial Securities Corporation of Denver, Colorado, and PrimeVest Financial Services, Inc of St Cloud, Minnesota. ING stated on Tuesday that it will retain ING Financial Advisors in Windsor, Connecticut, and ING Financial Partners, Inc, in Des Moines, Iowa, as these entities are highly integrated into its activity and play a key role in the groupâ€™s strategy in the United States, which is focused on retirement, life insurance, and rollover annuities.
