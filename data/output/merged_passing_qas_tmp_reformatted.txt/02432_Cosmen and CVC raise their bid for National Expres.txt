Cosmen and CVC raise their bid for National Express


On Thursday, the Cosmen family and the private equity investor CVC Capital Partners increased their bid for the 84.1% stake in National Express which the Austrian family does not already own from 450 pence per share to 500 pence. The would-be investors say that the bid will not be raised any further. It values the business at about GBP765m, or EUR876m, and the total amount of the transaction, if successful, would be about EUR2.1bn, including debt.
