Spanish government passes amendment to collective investment institution regulations


The Spanish government, in a cabinet meeting on Friday, has passed a draft royal decree which amends the regulations applicable to collective investment entities. The text will be published in the next few days in the official gazette (BOE). Among several modifications inspired by the impact of the financial crisis, the amendment will allow for the creation of side pockets, or “special objective funds.” The new law will also facilitate the liquidation of real estate funds and securities funds. The amendment also includes modifications intended to make restrictions on the activities of funds more flexible. It authorises the creation of ETFs in Sicav format, and creates a status for listed real estate investment companies (Socimi), the Spanish equivalent of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT). In addition, real estate funds will be allowed to invest in other real estate funds, but the legislation limits the amount invested in this way to 10% of assets. In practice, this is equivalent to maintaining the prohibition on real estate funds of funds.
