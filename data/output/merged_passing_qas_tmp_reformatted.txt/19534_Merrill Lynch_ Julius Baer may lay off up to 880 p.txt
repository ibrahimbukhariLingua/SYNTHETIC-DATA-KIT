Merrill Lynch: Julius Baer may lay off up to 880 people


The private bank Julius Baer may lay off 660 to 880 people, following the acquisition of some activities of Merrill Lynch from Bank of America, according to reports in the Sunday newspaper Der Sonntag. The CEO of the firm, Boris Collardi, had sought to take out 30% to 40% of Merrill Lynch employees, he recently stated in a meeting with investors, the newspaper reports. That would mean that 660 to 880 of the jobs, out of 2,200 at the US bank, could disappear. These staff reductions are necessary to prevent redundancies in the new structure, and to bring the cost/income ratio, which is currently over 100%, to about 70%.
