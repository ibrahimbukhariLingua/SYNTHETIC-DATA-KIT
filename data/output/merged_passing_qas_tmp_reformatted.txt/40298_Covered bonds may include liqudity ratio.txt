Covered bonds may include liqudity ratio


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In the context of ongoing debate about the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), the association of actors in the covered bond sector, the European Covered Bond Council (ECBC) on 4 February published a document which recommends that covered bonds be included in the highly liquid (level 1) class of assets under proposed LCR rules. “The inclusion of covered bonds in level 1 assets would make it possible to limit dependence on government debt in the European banking sector, and would facilitate the objective of delinking the government sector from the banking sector,” says Luca Bertalot, president of the association, in a statement.
