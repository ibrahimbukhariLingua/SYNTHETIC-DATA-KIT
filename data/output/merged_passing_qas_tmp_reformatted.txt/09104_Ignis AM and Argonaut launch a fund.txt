Ignis AM and Argonaut launch a fund


Ignis Asset Management and its European equities boutique, Argonaut Capital, have announced the launch of the Ignis Argonaut European Enhanced Income Fund. The fund, due to launch at the beginning of April (subject to regulatory approval), will utilise a covered call strategy whereby the manager will sell call options against stocks in the fund to generate a higher level of yield. In its first year the fund will target an annual yield of approximately 7%, with the target adjusted annually within a range of 5% to 9% thereafter. All returns from the Ignis Argonaut Enhanced Income Fund will be hedged to sterling. Oliver Russ, who co-founded Argonaut Capital Partners with Barry Norris, will manage the Ignis Argonaut European Enhanced Income Fund. The new fund will complement the GBP460 million Ignis Argonaut European Income Fund Similar to the European Income Fund, the new portfolio will invest in 30 to 55 stocks, concentrating on three key areas: value stocks offering high dividends and the potential for capital appreciation; growth stocks with high earnings growth and a record of returning cash to shareholders; and special situations, where dividends are currently low but have considerable potential to increase as a result of restructuring or other corporate action.
