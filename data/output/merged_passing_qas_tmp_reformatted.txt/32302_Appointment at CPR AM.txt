Appointment at CPR AM


On 15 February, CPR Asset Management announced the recruitment of Hubert Segura as head of sales for real estate via CPR Le Comptoir outlets. Since 2010, Segura had been director of development for Référence Pierre, an IFA brand from Izimmo. Le Comptoir par CPR will include a selection of SCPI funds managed by Amundi Immobilier as part of its “core” product offering, in order to better meet the needs of independent financial advisers and their wealth management clients. In addition to access to well-known SCPI funds (such as Rivoli Avenir Patrimoine or Edissimmo), Segura will participate in the commercial development of new-generation OPCI Funds such as Opcimmo.
