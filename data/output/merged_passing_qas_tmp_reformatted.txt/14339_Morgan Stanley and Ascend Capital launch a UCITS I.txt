Morgan Stanley and Ascend Capital launch a UCITS III fund


Morgan Stanley has announced the launch of a UCITS III fund, which will be domiciled in Ireland, and will be available on the firm’s local platform, FundLogic Alternatives. The San Francisco-based management firm Ascend Capital, which manages about USD3.2bn in assets, has been appointed as “investment manager” for the product, MS Ascend Ucits Fund, which will be promoted by Morgan Stanley. The fund is a long/short strategy focusing on US equities, which aims to “maximise gains and simultaneously to reduce volatility,” a statement from Morgan Stanley says.
