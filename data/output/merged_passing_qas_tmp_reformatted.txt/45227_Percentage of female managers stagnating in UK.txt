Percentage of female managers stagnating in UK


The proportion of British retail funds managed by women has stagnated in the past year, according to a study just published by Tilney Bestinvest. After reviewing the five largest categories established by the British assocaition of asset managers, Tilney Bestinvest found that only 7% of these funds were managed by women. By comparison, 23.5% of the seats on boards of directors at FTSE 100 companies are held by women.Out of the main categories, the “mixed investment 40-85%” sector has a percentage of 9% women, while “UK Equity Income” has only 5%. In other words, the study points out, this development is in flagrant contradiction with the growing number of young female graduates coming out of university, and a declared ambition to grant more positions to women in the interests of diversity. Compared with some other business sectors, asset management still has a long way to go.
