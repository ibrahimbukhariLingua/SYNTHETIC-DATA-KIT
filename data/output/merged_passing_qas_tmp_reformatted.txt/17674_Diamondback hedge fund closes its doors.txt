Diamondback hedge fund closes its doors


The alternative asset management firm Diamondback Capital Management, which is facing an insider trading investigation, has announced plans to close its doors following redemption demands from several major clients, the news agency Reuters reports. The two co-heads of the firm, Richard Schimel and Larry Sapanski, announced their plans to close in a letter sent to clients on 6 December following redemption demands totalling USD520m, five times the amount expected by directors. Assets under management by Diamondback have fallen to about USD1.45bn, after peaking at about USD5bn two years ago. Diamondback is planning to part with its 133 employees, while a small team will remain to liquidate funds.
