p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The New York-based activist hedge fund Aurelius Capital Management (USD2.4bn in assets) has found a new target: it has filed a lawsuit against Energy Future Holdings Corp., formerly known as TXU, which was acquired for USD45bn by the private equity investors KKR and TPG in 2007, the Wall Street Journal reports.Aurelius states that the largest affiliate of EFH, Texas Competitive Electric Holdings Company, is technically in default on USD23bn in credit, and that it granted a loan of USD1.9bn to its parent company EFH at a rate of only 500 basis points above the Libor, which is far below the market rate.
