AMF chairman issues warns of pitfalls in derivatives regulatory delay


In an interview with the Financial Times, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, chairman of the Autorité des marchés financiers, the French regulator, argues that the rivalry between Paris and London in the regulation of over-the-counter derivative markets may impede progress towards a pan-European solution, which would favour the United States. “In the US they have seen the threat. They are creating centralised clearing houses. But in Europe we are not there because there is disagreement between Paris, London and Frankfurt,” he says. “If Europe cannot agree, trading will be done with the clearing system of the US,” Jouyet warns.
