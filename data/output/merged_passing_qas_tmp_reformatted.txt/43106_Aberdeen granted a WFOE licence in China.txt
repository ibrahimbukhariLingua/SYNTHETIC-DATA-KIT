Aberdeen granted a WFOE licence in China


China has granted Aberdeen Asset Management a Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise (WFOE) business licence. The licence, issued to a newly-created Aberdeen subsidiary by the Shanghai Administration for Industry & Commerce, Pilot Free Trade Zone Branch, will enable the company to set up an office there under the pilot Free Trade Zone.The announcement comes as UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, leads a trade delegation to China. The UK-based asset manager has long wanted to expand its activities in China. The chief constraints have been access, control and manpower. The company has taken a gradual approach, having opened a representative office in 2007. That office has mainly performed liaison work. Under the new venture, the plan is to add analysts to research local equities and business development staff. At present, Aberdeen does such research mainly from Hong Kong, preferring to do this in-house, and this will continue. In the first stage asset-raising will focus on local institutions. The WFOE is based in the Free Trade Zone which brings further advantages.
