Pimco launches first actively-managed ETF


On Tuesday, Pimco (Allianz Global Investors group) announced the launch of its first actively-manged ETF fund, the Pimco Enhanced Short Maturity Strategy (listed under the acronym MINT on NYSE). The fund’s objective is to generate higher performance than money markets; it will be managed by Jerome Schneider, executive vice president of Pimco, following Pimco’s proven investment process, which combines macro-economic (top-down) and stock-picking (bottom-up) approaches. MINT may invest in money market instruments, bonds with long durations to maturity, and a wider range of investment grade bonds.
