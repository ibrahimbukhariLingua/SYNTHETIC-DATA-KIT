Diamant Bleu Gestion adds a fifth facet to its product range


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The former president of BNP Gestions and La Française des Placements, Arnaud Clément-Grandcourt, joined Diamant Bleu Gestion (EUR184m in assets currently) to manage the youngest fund in the product range, the contrarian international equities Sicav Diamant Bleu LFP Croissance et Résilience, according to his principles (the other four products in the range are FCP funds). The Sicav fund was created on 22 November 2010, and began its operations on 6 December. It will have about 30 positions, and its benchmark is a hybrid of 60% Eurostoxx 50 with dividends reinvested, and 40% capitalised Eonia.At a presentation in Paris on 9 December, Christian Jimenez, co-founder and president of Diamant Bleu Gestion, explained that the new fund received an initial investment of EUR11.33m from a small circle of institutional and private investors. It will have about EUR15m by the end of December, and EUR30m by the end of January, based on commitments from investors who are already sold on the fund.The new fund has “two parts, which reflect two processes, with the common philosophy being risk control,” the manager continues. “Among the shares in the growth portion, there are shares which will outperform when the markets are rising; in the resilience portion, there are shares which will lose less, and even generate positive returns, when the markets are falling.”The formula is based on increased flexibility in allocation between the growth and resilience portions. The fund shall or should invest 60% to 100% in equities, and may if need be allocate up to 100% to resilient equities, though the manager will avoid allocating more than 50% to the growth portfolio. “We look for risk assymetries, knowing that negatives will be lower than positives,” says Clément-Grandcourt. The fund is managed with a mid-term and long-only approach, without leverage and without derivatives.CharacteristicsName: Diamant Bleu LFP Croissance et RésilienceISIN codes: I shares: FR0010892588S shares: FR0010957936Management commission: I shares: 1.50% maximumS shares: 0.95% maximumPerformance commission: 20% of performance exceeding the benchmark, with high watermark
