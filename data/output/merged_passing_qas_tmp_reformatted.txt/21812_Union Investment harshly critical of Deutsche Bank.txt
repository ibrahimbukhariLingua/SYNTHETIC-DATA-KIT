Union Investment harshly critical of Deutsche Bank


At the Deutsche Bank AGM on Thursday, Ingo Speich, a portfolio manager at Union Investment, announced that he would be voting agains the discharge to Clemens Börsig, chairman of the supervisory board at Deutsche Bank, in which the asset management firm for the German co-operative banks is one of the largest shareholders, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. He accuses Börsig of having poorly managed the succession of Josef Ackermann as chairman at the bank, and of appointing a chief risk officer who was rejected by BaFin.Union has also been critical of a lack of transparency in acquisitions by Deutsche Bank (Noris and Berliner Bank), and of making unfortunate investments in the United States, as Scudder was absorbed by DWS and must now be resold along with RREEF and all asset management activities in North America.According to the Börsen-Zeitung, a motion to discharge the supervisory board received only 77.7% of votes in favour.
