Derivatives could still trigger a financial crisis


The head of the emerging markets unit at Templeton, Mark Mobius, estimates that the increasing use of derivative products could cause another financial crisis, Bloomberg reports. The lack of regulations governing these products and their multiplication were the cause of the last financial crisis, Mobius points out. “We shouldn’t be surprised if another financial crisis is waiting for us around the corner, since we haven’t resolved any of the issues that caused the last one,” Mobius says. Due to the high level of directional bets, he adds, there will be crises on equities markets in an environment of increased volatility.
