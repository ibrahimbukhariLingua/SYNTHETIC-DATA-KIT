Efama worried about impact of fund manager bonuses cap


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Efama announced yesterday at a press conference in London that it would be requesting an impact study of any decision by Europe to cap bonuses paid to fund managers, Agefi reports. The proposal by the legislator would limit variable remuneration to no more than the fixed salary poses a problem, as the principle of flexibility in order to reward performance is an important tool to balance good and bad years and remain competitive in other markets outside Europe. According to Efama heads, such a decision in Europe is all the more regrettable than it was taken as part of new legislation to limit UCITS funds, the newspaper reports.
