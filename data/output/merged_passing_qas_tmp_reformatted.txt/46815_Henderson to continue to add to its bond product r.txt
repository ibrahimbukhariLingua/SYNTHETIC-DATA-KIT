Henderson to continue to add to its bond product range


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } “The strategy which we do not have today and which we would like to offer is US investment grade,” Chris Bullock, co-manager of the Henderson Horizon Euro Corporate Bond, Henderson Horizon Euro High Yield Bond et Henderson Horizon Global High Yield Bond funds at Henderson Global Investors, announced at a coference in Paris on Tuesday. “But this is a highly mature and saturated market. It will take years to reach critical size,” the manager adds. “But we have to start somewhere.” The emerging market bond range will also be built up over the years. “We have launched an emerging market credit fund, the Emerging Market Corporate Bond Fund. In ten years, I am sure that we will also have a sovereign fund and an absolute return fund for emerging markets,” Bullock says. Since 2007, Henderson Global Investors has gradually built up its teams and its credit range, largely through acquisitions. The idea has been to build a global platform.
