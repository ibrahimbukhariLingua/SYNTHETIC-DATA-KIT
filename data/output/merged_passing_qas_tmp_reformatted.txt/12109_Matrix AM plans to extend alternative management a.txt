Matrix AM plans to extend alternative management activities


Matrix Asset Management has appointed Rebecca Ledlie as head of products and marketing, with the objective of deploying the firm’s growth strategy, HedgeWeek reports. Ledlie, who previously worked at Gartmore as head of products, has a profound knowledge of the hedge fund universe, which she acquired largely at her former employer. Matrix has also announced that the Candela Fund, which was previously managed by Olympus Capital LLP, has been taken back in-house at Matric, and has been renamed as the Matrix Pan-European Equity Fund, in “further evidence of the firm’s desire to develop a range of first-class hedge funds,” according to Angus Wollhose, CEO of Matrix AM.
