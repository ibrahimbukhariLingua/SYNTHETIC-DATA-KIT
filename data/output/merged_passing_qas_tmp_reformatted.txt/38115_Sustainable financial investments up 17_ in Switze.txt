Sustainable financial investments up 17% in Switzerland last year


The volume of sustainable investments in Switzerland rose 16% last year, to CHF56.7bn, the German, Austrian and Swiss sustainable investment forum (FNG) says in its annual report, published on 7 May. The Forum observes that institutional investors in particular contributed to this growth. Their share in total sustainable investments stands at 59%, 5 points more than in 2012. Retail investors have seen their share fall to 41%. Investment foundations and pension funds have been more inclined to invest in this sector, the report finds, but religious institutions and charities are also increasingly taking this type of financial investment into consideration.
