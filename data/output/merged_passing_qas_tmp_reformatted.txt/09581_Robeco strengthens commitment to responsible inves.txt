Robeco strengthens commitment to responsible investment


The Dutch group Robeco announced on 1 February that it has decided to launch “a global, structured campaign in the area of responsible investment.” Robeco will intensify its activism at businesses to incite them to improve their practices, and will also apply exclusionary investment criteria, which will require it no longer to invest in some businesses. With this move, the firm hopes to “set an example and to show the type of responsible behaviour which it would like to see businesses it invests in to adopt.” In the future, firms which are unwilling to take into account the points raised in discussions with the investment firm may find themselves excluded. “We will now be excluding firms which do not respect international treaties that regulate the sale and production of controversial weapons, particularly cluster bombs and land mines.” The names of the businesses excluded may be found on the website http://www.robeco.com. Responsible investment also involves attention to transparency of investment costs, risks and returns for Robeco clients. In the future, Robeco websites will include a ranking of responsible investments (calculated in partnership with Sustainalytics, an independent agency) for each Robeco fund. On the basis of these rankings, clients will be able to decide whether or not to take certain factors into account in the formation of a portfolio. The listings will include Robeco funds as well as funds from third parties. Robeco will no longer advise third-party funds which invest in businesses that produce controversial weapons.
