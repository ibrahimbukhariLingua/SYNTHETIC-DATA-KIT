CO2: large French businesses increase commitments


Major French businesses are making increasingly large commitments to reduce CO2 emissions, but they are proving slow to adapt to new markets related to sustainable development, according to a study released on 7 December. According to the study, undertaken by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and the agency Accenture, and covering the 250 largest French businesses by market capitalisation, 72% of respondents have set CO2 emissions reduction objectives, compared with 66% in 2010 and 69% in 2011. CAC businesses are highly sensitive to these challenges: 97% responded to the survey, while the overall response rate stagnated at 32%, compared with an average of 49% for neighbouring countries. Investment in emissions reduction increased by 20% in 2012, to a total of EUR23bn at the 70 businesses which participated in the study. Among the other findings, CDP and Accenture emphasise that major French businesses are proving late to adapt their economic models to potential growth related to climate change: 395 are betting on an increase in demand for sustainable products and services, but only 26% see it as an opportunity to develop such products and services.
