CNMV wants to charge users for ratings


Julio Segura, president of the Spanish securities commission (CNMV), says that rating agencies continue to be subject to conflicts of interest, so long as they are paid by issuers that they rate, Cinco Días reports. At an unveiling of a book entitled “A century of Spanish financial history,” at the Bank of Spain, Segura stated that the solution would be to make ratings be paid for by those who use them, since the creation of an official agency would run the risk of creatind problems when it came to ratings of government bonds.
