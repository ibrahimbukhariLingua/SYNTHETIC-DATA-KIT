Legg Mason star manager expecting strong results for 2009


Financial News reports that Bill Miller, the star manager of the Legg Mason Value Trust fund, will beat his benchmark index, the S&P 500, in 2009, for the first time since 2006. Though investors have expressed relief at these outlooks, Financial News points out that the fund in question is nonetheless far from returning to its previous record condition. Miller beat the S&P 500 for fifteen years running, while the fund has gone from USD750m in 1991 to over USD20bn in 2006.
