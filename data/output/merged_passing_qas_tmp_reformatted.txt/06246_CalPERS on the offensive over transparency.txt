CalPERS on the offensive over transparency


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Californian pension fund CalPERS on 17 November announced new transparency requirements: all service providers will be required to divulge any potential use of an agent to win new contracts, and any family or financial ties which they may have to members of the CalPERS board of trustees. This new measure comes as a complement to those already adopted in the past 18 months, and will ensure that the fund’s decisions are “open and transparent,” says Rob Feckner, chairman of the board at CalPERS. The new rule comes into effect from 1 December, and applies to all contracts valued at USD10,000 or more.
