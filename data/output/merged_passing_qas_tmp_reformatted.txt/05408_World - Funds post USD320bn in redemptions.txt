World - Funds post USD320bn in redemptions


Investment funds have seen net redemptions of EUR320bn in 2008, the Financial Times reports, citing statistics from Emerging Portfolio Funds Research, which tracks inflows and outflows for funds worldwide. This is a record both in dollar terms and in terms of percentage of AUM. However, redemptions appear to have stabilised, and the trend even seems to have reversed in the last week of the year.
