David Einhorn warns against a new tech bubble


Greenlight Capital, the hedge-fund firm run by David Einhorn, said in a letter to clients “there is a clear consensus that we are witnessing our second tech bubble in 15 years.The firm is betting against a group of technology stocks, which may fall by at least 90 percent “if and when the market reapplies traditional valuations,” according to the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News.“The current bubble is an echo of the previous tech bubble with fewer larger capitalization stocks and much less public enthusiasm,” Greenlight wrote.
