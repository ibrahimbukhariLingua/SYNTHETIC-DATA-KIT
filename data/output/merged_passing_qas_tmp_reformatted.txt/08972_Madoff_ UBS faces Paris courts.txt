Madoff: UBS faces Paris courts


Les Echos reports, citing AFP, that UBS has been summoned before the Paris courts on charges of defrauding 80 investors who lost money they had invested in the Luxembourg-registered fund Luxalpha, which was offered for sale by the bank, and which invested in companies operated by Bernard Madoff. The investors accuse UBS of having presented Luxalpha as a low-risk investment, and of having neglected its responsibilities as a manager and depositary for the product, which funnelled investments to the firm of the frauster Madoff without informing clients. The savings investors, who lost all of their investments in Luxalpha, have “strong grounds to seek reparation for the prejudice they suffered as a result of the deception of which they were victims and of the serious errors committed by UBS,” says the summons, of which a copy was obtained by AFP.
