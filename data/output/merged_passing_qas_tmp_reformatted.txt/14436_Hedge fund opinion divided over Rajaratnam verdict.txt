Hedge fund opinion divided over Rajaratnam verdict


The news of Raj Rajaratnam’s conviction came at a time when 1,700 professionals in the alternative management industry were meeting in Las Vegas for a conference known as SALT, the Wall Street Journal reports. “It’s bad for business,” admitted Donald Lucardi, a director in the Citigroup unit which sells hedge funds. Some think that the verdict will lead to stricter controls, particularly of long/short funds. Others see the verdict in a more positive light, noting that it could help clean up the industry.
