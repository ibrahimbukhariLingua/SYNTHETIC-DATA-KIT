SEC withdraws license from manager of Z Seven Fund


The SEC has withdrawn the license of Barry Ziskin, who now is no longer authorised to practice as a fund manager in the United States. The regulator accuses the manager at Top Fund Management and Ziskin Asset Management of failing to respect the prospectus of the Z Seven fund. Investors were not correctly informed of the use of options, a statement from the regulator says.
