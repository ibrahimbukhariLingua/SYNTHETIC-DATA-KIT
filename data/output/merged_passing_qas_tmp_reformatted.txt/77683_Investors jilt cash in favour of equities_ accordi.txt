Investors jilt cash in favour of equities, according to BofA Merrill Lynch


International investors have found some appetite for risk in April, according to the latest Fund Manager Survey from BofA Merrill Lynch. Cash positions globally fell, as they were redeployed into equities. The number of managers overweight in cash has fallen 14 points to 26%, while managers overweight in equities have increased by the same proportion to 17%. European equities benefited from the general rebound, with an 8% increase in allocations, and managers are now neutral on this asset class. Emerging market equities remain popular, with 34% of managers overweight. The main strategies for international managers, according to the survey, are European equity short positions (25%), purchases of FAANG+BAT top-shelf US and Chinese internet stocks (18%), buying US dollars (17%) and buying US Treasury bonds (16%). For the macroeconomy, the three main risks cited by respondents are the trade war (20%), a slowing Chinese economy (20%), and ineffective monetary policy (18%). Two thirds are bearish on growth outlooks and inflation over the next 12 months, the highest level of fears of secular stagnation since October 2016. Recessionary fears are not widely shared by the investor community, as only 6% of managers predict a recession this year. An inversion of the US interest rate curve does not worry investors, with 86% of respondents predicting that it is not a signal of an imminent recession. Only 13% predict that interest rates will be hiked by the US Fed by the end of the year, the lowest level for this measure since 2012.
