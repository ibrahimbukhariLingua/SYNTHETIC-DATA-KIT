AIMA fights hedge fund directive


The hedge fund sector is mobilizing in an effort to convince the European authorities to reconsider its planned Alternative Investment Fund Managers directive. But, according to Andrew Baker, CEO of the alternative management association AIMA, speaking to Hedge Week, “it is vital that other economic actors, from members of the real estate sector to pension funds’ trustees, rally behind this campaign to prevent a hastily-written law from impeding the economic competitiveness of Europe.”
