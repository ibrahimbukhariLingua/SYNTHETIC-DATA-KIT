ETF tracking error up sharply in 2009


According to a study of the performance of ETFs undertaken by Goldman Sachs, ETFs had an average tracking error last year of 1.25 percentage points against the indices they replicate, compared with 0.52% in 2008, the Wall Street Journal reports. Tracking errors of more than 3% were observed for 54 funds while only 4 funds had tracking errors at this level in 2008. Some funds missed their indices by more than 10%. Though the SPDR (SPY), the largest ETF on the market, finished the year only 0.19% behind the S&P 500, the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index ETF (EEM), which has USD40bn in assets, earned returns of 71.8% last year, while its benchmark gained 78.5%. The SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield ETF (JNK) was 1,300bps late on its index which gained 53.5%. But tracking errors are not always negative: the Vanguard Telecom Services ETF (VOX, USD200m) earned 29.6% returns, compared with 12.6% for the benchmark.
