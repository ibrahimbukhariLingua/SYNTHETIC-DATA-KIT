Assenagon releases a credit fund


The German BaFin and the Austrian FMA on 18 October approved the Assenagon Credit Debt Capital fund for sale in Germany and Austria. The fund, with EUR93m in assets, currently aims for returns 450 basis points higher than the Euribor 3-month (after fees), regardless of the evolution of equity and bond markets. Assenagon Asset Management, the German asset management firm which manages the Source line of ETFs (see Newsmanagers of 30 June), says that the portfolio will be managed primarily so as to exploit valuation spreads between bonds and equities from the same issuer. The management team (Jochen Felsenheimer and Wolfgang Klopfer) are able to use a full range of instruments in structuring its capital. Credit, interest rate and forex risks will largely be neutralised through the use of appropriate hedging instruments.
