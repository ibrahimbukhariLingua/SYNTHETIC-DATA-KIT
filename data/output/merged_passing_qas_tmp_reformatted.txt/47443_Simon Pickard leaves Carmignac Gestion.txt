Simon Pickard leaves Carmignac Gestion


Simon Pickard and Edward Cole are leaving Carmignac Gestion. The French asset management firm, which announced the departure of the two fund managers yesterday evening, says that the moves are for personal reasons. On the emerging markets equity team, Pickard, who is the head, manages the Carmignac Emergents fund, while Cole is responsible for managing the Carmignac Portfolio Emerging Patrimoine fund.The two professionals will be replaced internally by Xavier Hovasse and David Park.Beyond the departures of two fund managers from a strategic asset class for Carmignac Gestion, the fact that Pickard is leaving the firm represents an event. The professional, who joined the firm in 2000, and who was head of management for European equities, stayed 12 years, after an initial departure in 2005 for the Swiss asset management firm Argos IM, and a return to Carmignac in 2008 to take over emerging market management, following the departure of manager Wen Zhan Goldberg.
