Injunction against Deutsche IM


Deutsche Investment Management has been told by a court to stop using three in-house software tools to the extent that they replicate or duplicate the design or functionality of specific tools developed by Invesco Institutional, an arm of Amvescap, in the latest round of a near-three year legal battle with Amvescap, says Financial Times FM. The case stems from March 2007 when 16 Wall Street-based members of Amvescapâ€™s fixed income team defected to Deutsche.
