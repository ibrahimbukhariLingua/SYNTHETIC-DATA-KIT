Investorsâ€™ appetite for risk back in force


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Investors have regained their appetite for risk, concentrating largely on emerging markets equities, in the expectation of a second wave of quantitative easing, according to the most recent survey by BofA Merrill Lynch of a sample of 194 management firms with USD492bn in assets between 8 and 14 October. The level of risk taken on by investors has not increased by such a large proportion since April 2009. The proportion of allocators who are heavyweight in equities has more than tripled, to a total of 27% in net, compared with 10% in September. They have also maintained underweight exposures to bonds, while only 6%, compared with 18% previously, are overweight in cash. The evolution worked largely to the advantage of emerging markets equities, in which 49% of allocators were overweight, a month on month increase of 17 percentage points. Appetite for US, European and Japanese equities remained stable, while respondents were less pessimistic about UK equities. Managers were also slightly more optimistic about the growth of the Chinese economy in the next 12 months (19% compared with 11% in September). Investors were also much more optimistic about the growth outlooks for corporate profits, as the percentage of allocators who are overweight in industrial shares increased from 4% to 15% in the space of one month. Investors would like to see businesses adopt a more aggressive investment policy, though last month many of them wanted to see them consolidate their balance sheets.
