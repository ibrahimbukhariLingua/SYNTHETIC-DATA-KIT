European parliament wants European regulations to apply to small funds also


According to the proposals of MEP Jean-Paul Gauzès, the European Parliament is recommending that the AIFM directive should apply to all hedge funds and private equity funds, regardless of their size, and that funds should be required to adhere to certain regulatory ratios for all their activities, Handelsblatt reports. The European MP also calls for stricter rules for hedge funds than for private equity funds. However, he does not want to deprive hedge funds of the ability to short-sell, and refuses to require private equity funds to disclose sensitive information about the firms in their portfolios. And he does not demand that venture capitalists undergo regular ratings. Lastly, Gauzès supports proposals by the European Commission that the European passport be restricted to funds domiciled in the European Union, though he would leave member states free to accept funds from outside the Union within their own borders.
