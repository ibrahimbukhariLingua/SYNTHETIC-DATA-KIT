Chief risk officer leaves ING IM


David Seutens, chief risk officer at ING Investment Management, will be leaving his job at the end of April, IPE.com reports. Michel van Mazijk, who had been head of development for the Dutch institutional market, has also recently left the firm. But Karl Hanuska, spokesman for ING, tells IPE.com that the timing of the departures is a pure coincidence, and that they have nothing to do with plans to restructure the firm.
