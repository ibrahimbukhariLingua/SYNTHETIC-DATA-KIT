Mario Draghi calls on banks to pay less in dividends and bonuses


The chairman of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, yesterday defened the German banking associationsâ€™ measures, resolved at the end of 2011, including subsidized credits for euro zone banks, Les Echos reports. Draghi welcomed the new budget treaty now in the ratification process, and the efforts on the part of Italy and Spain, but warned that guard should not be let down. Banks, he says, should take advantage of the current favourable environment to increase their resistance to shocks, by holding on to their profits instead of handing them out as bonuses and dividends.
