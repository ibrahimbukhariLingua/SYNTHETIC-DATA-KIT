Risk management will be maintained at the strategy level, and will be transversally covered by an independent diagnostic risk team from the hedge fund world. Funds People reports for its part that managers who do not earn positive returns will not earn bonuses, while Global Pensions states that bonuses will be paid out in instalments over two to three years, and withdrawn if managers underperform.
