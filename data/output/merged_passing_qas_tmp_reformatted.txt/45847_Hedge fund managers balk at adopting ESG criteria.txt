Hedge fund managers balk at adopting ESG criteria


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The majority of hedge fund managers (60%) have a “certain reticence” about taking environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into account, a new study by Unigestion finds. However, the results are better than three years ago, when the percentage of “reticent” respondents was 75%. At the same time, the percentage of managers considered “leaders” by Unigestion in the area of ESG Has more than quadrupled, from 3% to 13%. Among managers surveyed, those specialised in equity strategies (long/short equities, equity market neutral) are more advanced in terms of taking ESG issues into account than managers who privilege tactical trading (global macro, CTA, commodities). “This finding is nothing suprising, to the extent that equity trading offers many opportunities to integrate ESG criteria into an investment process,” Unigestion comments. Managers of private assets, who were interviewed for the first time this year, are better in the adoption of ESG criteria than hedge fund managers: only 27% say they are reticent about the idea. Nearly one fifth of manaers in this category are considered “leaders.” Lastly, European hedge fund and private asset managers are generally more interested in ESG issues than their American counterparts.
