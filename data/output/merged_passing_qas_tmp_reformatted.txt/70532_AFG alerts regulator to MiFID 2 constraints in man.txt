AFG alerts regulator to MiFID 2 constraints in mandated management


Mandated management has been severely affected by the MiFID 2 directive, for various reasons. In its report on its activities in the year 2017, the French financial management association AFG repeated this fact oft and emotively. It does indicate more precisely, though, that by way of its mandated management working group, it has drawn the attention of the French financial market authority (AMF) to the difficulties observed by its members, particularly with respect to a requirement to alert investors in the event of a decline of 10% or more in the total value of their mandated portfolios compared with the last known reporting, under article 25.6 of the MiFID 2 directive, and article 62.1 of its Delegated rule. The alert must come within 24 hours from the time the manager makes the observation, and must be done via the usual means of communication between the asset management firm and the client, the AFG states. “As this obligation is difficult to implement due to the financial and management constraints it creates, the AFG has teamed up with other European associations to alert the AMF, the European Commission and EFAMA about the difficulties implementing this requirement,” the report says.
