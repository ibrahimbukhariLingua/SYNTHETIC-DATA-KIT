p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The German asset management firm Allianz Global Investors (AllianzGI) on 31 January announced that via the Allianz Renewable Energy Fund 2 (AREF 2) it is acquiring three solar energy plants in the United Kingdom. The plants are located in Cambridgeshire, Worcestershire, and Norfolk. The acquisition of Mount Farm in the West Midlands by AREF 2 was finalised in December 2016, while the closing of the two additional Vine Farm and Rose & Crown projects in the east of England was on 26 January 2017, the asset management firm says in a statement. The total capacity of the solar plants is 100 megawatts. The firm states that following the acquisition of wind farms in Germany and Sweden, the portfolio of British solar plants represents a third operation of the AREF 2 fund, a specialist in renewable energies. The subscription period for the vehicle ended on 15 November 2016. The total amount of the fund, which has about EUR350m, will largely be invested in wind and solar farms in Europe, on behalf of institutional investors. When the fund is fully invested, the infrastructure equity team at AllianzGI will have about EUR1.6bn in assets under management in renewable energies and infrastructure projects.
