Founder of Reserve Primary cleared of fraud charges


Bruce Bent, the founder of the Reserve Primary money market fund that «broke the buck» during the financial crisis, was cleared of charges of fraud, which claimed that he misled investors about the financial health of the fund in order to avoid a wave of redemptions, the Financial Times reports. The jury found that Bent’s son, also named Bruce, was liable of negligence for misleading investors about the family’s plans to cover losses from the fund triggered by the Lehman bankruptcy. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed the case, is seeking fines for Bent Jr. and the firm, Reserve Management, which was also found liable.
