Man Group CEO criticizes aspects of draft AIFM directive


In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Peter Clarke, CEO of Man Group, says there has been a rebound in demand on the part of investors, particularly for guaranteed products. He also says that Man Group is favourably disposed to several points in the draft alternative management directive proposed in Brussels: some security standards need to apply to all hedge funds, including the smallest ones which are not publicly traded, in order for competition to be equitable. However, Clarke considers the text too hard on non-European hedge funds. He argues that the idea of requiring banks to be responsible for hedge fundsâ€™ risks is too onerous. Lastly, the idea of limiting the amount of leverage which hedge funds are allowed to use to increase their performance goes a step too far.
