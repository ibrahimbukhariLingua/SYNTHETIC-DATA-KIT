European Wealth has acquired the P&C Global Wealth Managers company, based in Switzerland, and the affiliated company GTI Fund Investment. P&C has largely international clients, for whom it manages nearly GBP100m in discretionary funds, while GTI, registered in the Cayman Islands, distributes funds advised by P&C. The directors and founders of P&C teamed up for the transaction , including Ian Little, who will join the board of European Investment Management, an affiliate of European Wealth, and Bruce Albrecht, as a consultant. Albrecht is former group CIO at N.M. Rothschild London, and was CIO Europe for the Abu Dhabi sovereign fund DIA. European Wealth hopes that the two acquisitions will bring it a solid offshore base, and could be a point of entry to the Middle East market.
