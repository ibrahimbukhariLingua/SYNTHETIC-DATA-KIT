Bond funds set records for inflows


Sales of bond funds in Europe hit their highest one month total on record since Lipperâ€™s regular sales monitoring began in 2002 reaching EUR30bn. While high yield bonds and emerging market debt were again much in demand (EUR5bn and EUR4.8bn respectively, across different sub-sectors), the inflows to bond funds as a whole were the result of interest expanding across a wider range of sectors, according to Lipper.Bond fund assets now stand at EUR1.7trn, making up 28.5% of the European industry. Five years ago this proportion was 20.2% (October 2007). For equity funds, the proportion has shrunk from 41.1% to 34.0% over the same period, with assets now at EUR2.0trn.After the encouragement for asset managers last month of a revival in equity fund flows, this dropped back this month to EUR1.3bn, from EUR4.7bn.Inflows to long-term funds (i.e. excluding money market activity) nudged up again this month to EUR31.6bn, meaning sales have reached a 24-month high. Including money market funds, the figures look even better at EUR38.3bn, the largest monthly total since August 2010.Four groups attracted net sales of more than EUR1bn this month. Pimco led the way with EUR4.2bn, ahead of BlackRock (EUR3.3bn; EUR2.2bn of which relates to ETFs), AXA (EUR2.9bn) and JPMorgan (EUR1.3bn).
