For the first time since 2008, inflows to FCPI and FIP funds in 2017 tops EUR1bn


Total inflows to innovation investment funds (fonds communs de placement dans l’innovation, FCPI) and proximity investment funds (fonds d’investissement de proximité, FIP), totalled EUR1.084bn, compared with EUR967m in 2016 (+12%), bringing them back to 2008 levels (EUR1.180bn), after five consecutive years of increases, a joint study by the Association Française de la Gestion financière (AFG) and France Invest (Association des Investisseurs pour la Croissance) has found.“This exceptional level of inflows is related to authorisation for a tax reduction on the solidarity wealth tax for small and mid-sized businesses for the real estate wealth tax in 2018,” the professional associations explain. In 2017, inflows to the income tax-reduction funds totalled EUR502m (+11%/2016), while funds for wealth tax reduction totalled EUR581m (+13%/2016). These sums have been rising since 2013, and are now nearing 2008 levels (income tax reduction funds in 2008: EUR584m; wealth tax funds in 2008 EUR596m). The wealth tax reduction will end from 2018. Sums collected for income tax reduction may also increase noticeably from 2018 due to an increase in the tax break from 17% to 25%.Rebounding inflows since 2013 for FIP and FCPI funds has followed divergent trajectories in 2017. FCPI funds posted all-time record inflows in 2017 of EUR637m. FIP funds had a net decline in inflows to EUR446m, compared with EUR557m in 2016. In 2017, 137,000 retail investors subscribed to FCPI and/or FIP funds, near the all-time record of 145,000 subscriptions in 2008. The average subscription abount is down to EUR7,900 (-7%/2016). eight funds raised capital in 2017, compared with 73 in 2016: FIPs represent 60% of funds, and 41% of inflows (41 FIP funds, EUR446m), while FCPI funds represent 40% of funds, and 59% of inflows (27 FCPI funds, EUR637m).
