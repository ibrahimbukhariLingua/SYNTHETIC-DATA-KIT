p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } For the occasion of the visit of French president Emmanuel Macron to China, a new protocol agreement was signed on 9 January by Bpifrance, China Development Bank and Cathay Capital. Under the agreement, the three partners created the second French-Chinese fund, Sino French Midcap II, with the objective of raising EUR1.2bn. “This fund will make its first closing and its first investments by June 2018,” Bpifrance says in a statement. The vehicle follows the first Sino French (Midcap) fund, launched in 2014 by China Development Bank and Bpifrance, with EUR500m. Like its predecessor, Sino French Midcap Fund II will concentrate primarily on mid-sized businesses with strong potential for growth, creation of value and international development. The Sino French Midcap Fund II will invest primarily in China and France, with an option to invest a small part elsewhere in Europe and North America. The Sino French Midcap Fund II also plans to attract other French, Chinese and international institutional investors, making a joint contribution to international cooperation. “To help to internationalise the renminbi (RMB) and to promote the position of France as as global hub for sales and financial transactions in RMB, the fund will also welcome investors in RMB,” Bpifrance says.
