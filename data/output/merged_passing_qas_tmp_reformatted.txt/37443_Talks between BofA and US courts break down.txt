It adds that a representative of the Department of Justice had mentioned a figure of about USD17bn, which would be the largest ever paid by a bank. On Tuesday, as Bank of America was seeking to resume the talks, a representative of the Department of Justice was working over the final touches of a civil lawsuit against the bank, the article states. The case, which may take time to be filed through official channels, is expected to accuse the bank of selling investment products which ultimately suffered billions of dollars in losses.
