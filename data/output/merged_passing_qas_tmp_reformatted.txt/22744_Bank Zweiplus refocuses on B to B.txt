Bank Zweiplus refocuses on B to B


Bank Zweiplus is planning to refocus its activities on core activities in the future, including activities dedicated to financial services providers, wealth managers and insurers. In other words, the firm is planning to position itself as a preferred B to B banking partner, able to offer solutions adapted to its business clients. As a result, the retail clients unit will be managed by the Cash online platform, effective immediately, the firm controlled by Sarasin bank (57.5%) and Falcon PrivateBank (42.5%) announced on 16 April. Zweiplus claims that the market appears to be showing a need for an independent product and development platform for qualified financial service providers, wealth managers and insurers. The bank is planning to respond to this development by making a clear separation between accounts in its two major units of activity, namely business and retail clients. For retail clients, the Cash online platform, with Zweiplus, has created Cash Zweiplus AG, 50% controlled by Ringier and 50% by Zweiplus. Ringier is contributing the “Cash” brand and the platform of the same name, already used by 170,000 users. As of the end of 2011, assets under management at Zweiplus bank totalled CHF4.8bn.
