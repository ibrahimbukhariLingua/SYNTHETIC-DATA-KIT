Hess changes strategy under pressure from Elliott Management


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Wall Street Journal reports that as John Hess is saying that his activist alternative asset management firm has missed the train, Hess Corp is in the process of changing tracks though, after Elliott management sent the CEO a message asking him to restructure the firm. There will be a reshuffle on the board of directors, which will affect six of its 14 seats, and sales of assets to increase dividends, along with a USD4bn equity repurchase programme, equivalent to 18% of the market capitalisation of Hess.However, John Hess does not accept Elliottâ€™s primary demand, which is to break up the group into a Bakken company and an international oil firm whose survival may be at risk. This may spell the end for Hess, a difficult scenario to accept for a CEO whose company is named after him.
