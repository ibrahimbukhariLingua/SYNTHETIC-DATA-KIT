PGGM and Foncière Atland create a joint venture dedicated to office property


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Netherlands pension fund PGGM and the publicly-traded real estate investment company Foncière Atland have announced that they are creating a common investment vehicle to target office properties in Paris and the Paris region. The fund will have an investment capacity of EUR250m. The new structure will aim to invest in tertiary assets with potential to create value, the two partners say in a statement. The assets acquired will be subject to an active asset management policy: renovation, extension or restructuration, and improvement of cash flow. The properties acquired will then be repositioned as core assets to generate ongoing revenues, “with a confirmed ambition of reducing energy consumption and of improving environmental performance,” PGGM and Foncière Atland add. The joint venture will be structured via a SPPICAV (Société à Prépondérance Immobilière à Capital Variable) realty company, which is currently pending a license from the French financial authority, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF); its management will then be outsourced to the Voisin company. The fund has already acquired a first property located in Montreuil. The financing for the acquisition came from Bred. The transaction was processed by Savills.
