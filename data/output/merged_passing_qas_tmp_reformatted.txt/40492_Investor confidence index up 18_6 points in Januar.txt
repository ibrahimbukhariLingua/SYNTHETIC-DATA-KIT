Investor confidence index up 18.6 points in January


The Global State Street Investor Confidence Index (ICI) rose to 114.4 in January, up 18.6 points from December’s revised reading of 95.8. The reading was the largest in over four years and was driven by a sharp increase in North American sentiment from 92.1 to 113.6 along with increases in both European and Asian sentiment. European sentiment rose to 112.6 from December’s revised reading of 107.5. Sentiment in Asia rose to 103.5 from 97.7.“Policy uncertainty was reduced in the US and confidence was boosted by optimism over the Fed’s policy of forward guidance, which may help anchor low interest rates going forward,” commented Jessica Donohue, senior managing director and head of research and advisory services, State Street Global Exchange. “In Europe, stronger economic fundamentals and looser monetary policy led to improved sentiment,” added professor Ken Froot. “Easier financing conditions for peripheral European sovereigns and speculation for more unconventional measures by the ECB, given below target inflation, has led to broader optimism among institutional investors.”
