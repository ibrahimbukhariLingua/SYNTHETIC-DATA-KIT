CNMV questions relevance of actively-managed ETFs


Funds People reports that at a meeting on the fourth anniversary of the introduction of ETFs to the Spanish market, José María Bermejo, director for “entities” at the CNMV, says that innovations in the area of exchange-traded funds raise questions about the gradually increasing sophistication of the indices the funds replicate, as well as the appearance of actively-managed ETFs. He says that the transparency of the products needs to be increased, and the opportunities these products provide need to be better evaluated, both in terms of the indices the funds replicate and the procedures used to replicate them.
