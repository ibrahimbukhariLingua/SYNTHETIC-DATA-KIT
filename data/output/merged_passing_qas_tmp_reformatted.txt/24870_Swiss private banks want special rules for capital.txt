Swiss private banks want special rules for capital adequacy


The Swiss private bankers’ association (ABPS) is continuing to campaign for recognition of its members’ special characteristics, Agefi Switzerland reports. It is now aiming to bring about a revision of the law on capital adequacy and distribution of risks, which is under consultation until 16 January. Under its application of the Basel III accords, the law states that assets of partners are considered Core Equity Tier 1 (CET1) only if an agreement determines that all partners sustain equal losses in case of severe problems. The clause would not be relevant in cases where all partners are infinitely liable, the ABPS claims, adding that the Basel III rules do not consider the particular qualities of private banks.
