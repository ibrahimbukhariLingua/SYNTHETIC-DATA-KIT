2009 was a very good year for hedge funds


The Morningstar 1000 Hedge Fund Index gained only 0.1% in December, but for the year as a whole, it has earned 19.5%, close to the record set in 2003 (20.3%). The strategies with the most heavily negative results in 2008 went on to earn the highest returns last year, according to Morningstar. The Morningstar Emerging Market Equity Hedge Fund Index, which lost 45.7% in 2008, bounced back with gains of 50.4% in 2009. Meanwhile, the Morningstar U.S. Small Cap Equity Hedge Fund Index finished the year 2008 with one of its worst performances ever (-32.8%), but posted gains of 36.4% in 2009. However, hedge funds specialised in emerging markets and small caps did not manage to offset all of their losses in 2008. Another big winner in 2009 was convertibles arbitrage, whose benchmark index gained 2.1% in December, and shows gains of moer than 37% in 2009, after one of its worst performances ever in 2008. However, some strategies, such as the Short Equity and Global Trend, continued their negative trajectories through the end of the year. In the first eleven months of the year, hedge funds posted net outflows of USD53.4bn, but subscriptions began to flow in once again in June. In November of last year, hedge funds saw USD4.7bn in subscriptions. In other notable developments last year, Morningstar observes that small hedge funds outperformed larger structures and the single-manager hedge funds performed better on average than funds of funds.
