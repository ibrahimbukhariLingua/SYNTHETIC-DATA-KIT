Wells Fargo Seeks Investment Firm License in France


Wells Fargo & Company announced it has applied for its investment firm license from the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution; ACPR), which is responsible for supervising the French banking and insurance sectors. This announcement is part of the company’s Brexit strategy, which is predicated on supporting the capital markets and investment banking needs of Wells Fargo’s customers in a post Brexit environment.“With Brexit on the horizon, Wells Fargo is committed to providing a transition, which is as seamless as possible, for its markets and investment banking customers within the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA),” said Alicia Reyes, head of Wells Fargo Securities in Europe, Middle East and Africa. “Wells Fargo has been present in Europe for many decades, and during this time, we have strengthened our relationships with our local authorities and deepened our customer base. Through Wells Fargo Securities Europe, we expect to leverage our network in the region and beyond by establishing a Paris hub in continental Europe.”Subject to regulatory approval by the ACPR, the investment firm license will be held by Wells Fargo Securities Europe S.A. (WFSE) in Paris, France. It is intended that WFSE - which will be a new subsidiary of Wells Fargo - will offer a range of capital markets and investment banking services to its European and international customers that require access to the EU and the EEA.“I welcome the decision of Wells Fargo to choose Paris as the hub for its trading activities. The creation of a European hub in Paris for its trading activities will allow Wells Fargo to benefit from the deep liquidity of markets, as well as a positive ecosystem including the strong talent pool in Paris,” said Bruno Le Maire, Minister for Economy and Finances of France.Authorised and regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Wells Fargo Securities International Limited (WFSIL) is currently the Company’s broker dealer in the UK and provides equities; fixed income, currencies sales and trading; futures clearing and execution; debt capital markets origination; and investment banking advisory services to customers within the EU/EEA. Post Brexit, when Britain leaves EU in March 2019, customers from the UK and most non-EU markets will continue to be served in the UK by WFSIL.Further announcements on Wells Fargo’s Brexit strategy are expected to be made in the near future.
