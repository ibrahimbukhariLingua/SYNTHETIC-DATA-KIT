Banca March launches a solar energy fund


Rafael Siruelos, director of wealth management products at Banca March, has announced to Cinco DÃ­as that the management firm has launched a fund entitled March Solar, aimed at high net worth private clients, and which will aim to raise EUR130m-EUR140m by investing in solar power installations able to generate a total of 30 megawatts (MW), in five or six locations. Banca March has already convinced 220 clients to invest in the fund, offering them 12% returns per year if they agree to remain invested for six years. Minimal subscription is set at EUR50,000, and the product is aimed at investors who have at least EUR45,000 in financial savings. The March Solar fund will be advised by Vita Renovables, and Banca March is planning to retain a stake of about 15% in the fund.
