Renaissance offers selective frontier markets fund


The British asset management firm Renaissance Asset Managers on 1 March announced the launch of the Renaissance Frontier Markets Fund, a sub-fund of its UCITS-compliant, Luxembourg-registered Sicav. The new product is available to institutional and qualified retail investors.The manager, Sven Richter, says that the portfolio will be concentrated on shares from ten of the 25 countries in which annual growth is expected to be higher than 4%. These countries are Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, Ukraine and Vietnam. At all times, these countries will account for 85% to 100% of assets.These countries were chosen because they satisfy a number of criteria, including a population of over 35 million, projected GDP growth of over 4% per year over the next decade, a GDP per capita of less than USD6,000, relatively undeveloped markets, a significant young population, attractive resources, and the potential to develop due to these factors.
