ETF inflows follow investor fears


According to statistics from iShares on behalf of Agefi, inflows to government bond ETFs increased by USD603m last month, but investors were selective. Concerns about growth supported exposure to German, US and UK government bonds. Concerns about the Euro zone also drove investors to adopt positions on emerging markets, such that inflows to ETFs in this area ran to USD1.4bn in June. In the commodities segment, aversion to risk pushed USD564m in new flows to precious metals ETPs, whereas these funds saw outflows of USD255m in May.
