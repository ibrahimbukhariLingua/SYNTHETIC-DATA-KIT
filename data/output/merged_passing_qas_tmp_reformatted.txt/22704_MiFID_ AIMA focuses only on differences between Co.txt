MiFID: AIMA focuses only on differences between Commission and ESMA


The international alternative investment management association (AIMA) on 17 April released a 40-page statement laying out and analysing the differences between the regulations proposed by the European Commission and the recommendations of the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) for measures to be included in the level 2 MiFID directive.The association explains that it is seeking to illustrate and analyse the marked divergences of the Commission’s text from the recommendations, and points out a few unseen consequences of the proposed modifications.The divergences between the Commission document and the ESMA recommendations appear to be both “significant and extensive.” In their current form, the rules proposed by the Commission could disturb the functioning of the asset management sector in the European Union and worldwide, and may also work against some of its declared objectives in the areas of investor protection and financial stability, the AIMA claims.
