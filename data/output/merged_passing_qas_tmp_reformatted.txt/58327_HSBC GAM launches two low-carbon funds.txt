HSBC GAM launches two low-carbon funds


HSBC Global Asset Management is launching two low carbon emissions funds: HSBC GIF Global Lower Carbon Equity and HSBC GIF Global Lower Carbon Bond. The first of these funds will seek to have a lower carbon footprint than its benchmark index, by reducing total exposure to shares with higher carbon gas emissions. The fund will mainly invest in shares from developed markets. The second fund will have the same objective, and will seek to better understand the impact of individual emitters and sectors on total carbon gas emissions. The fund will mainly invest in investment grade corporate bonds.
