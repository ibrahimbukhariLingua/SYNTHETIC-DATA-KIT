EFAMA wants to combat financial illiteracy


Europe faces a crisis of financial literacy, with millions of its people struggling to cope with even basic concepts of savings and investment. These are the findings of a new report from the European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA), entitled Building Blocks for Industry Driven Investor Education Initiatives, launched in Brussels on Monday. The 160 pages-report confirms widespread ignorance of financial matters, with consumers baffled by concepts such as interest rates and inflation. “Financial illiteracy is both widespread and particularly severe among specific demographic groups. Low levels of financial literacy are not specific to a given country or stage of economic development. They are found everywhere,” said Professor Annamaria Lusardi, of The George Washington School of Business.Research found that asked the impact of a two per cent interest rate on a deposit of EUR100, those giving the correct answer of EUR102 ranged in Europe from more than 85 per cent in some countries to less than 40 per cent in others. The best-performing nations were the Netherlands, with 84.8 per cent giving the correct answer, Germany, with 82.4 per cent answering correctly, and Switzerland, where 79.3 per cent gave the correct answer.The report also highlights the importance of developing partnerships between governments, the financial industry, European institutions and the media in order to promote financial education in an effective manner. The report also confirms the key role that the industry can play in enhancing the quality of financial training of staff and financial intermediaries to help them enable potential investors to make better-informed investment decisions. Finally, the review encompasses concrete initiatives undertaken by professional associations and investment managers to promote financial education.
