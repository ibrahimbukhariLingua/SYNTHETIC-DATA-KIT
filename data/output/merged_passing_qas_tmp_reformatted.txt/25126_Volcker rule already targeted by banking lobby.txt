Volcker rule already targeted by banking lobby


The Volcker rule passed in mid-December, which is part of the Dodd-Frank rule, is subject to a lawsuit filed by the American Bankers Association against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), Agefi reports. The lobby of regional credit establishments wants to suspend the application of the aforementioned rule by the end of the year. A particular term concerns them, related to trust preferred securities (Trups). These hybrid instruments, issued by vehicles which issue banking debt, are widely used by regional banks. The ones which had issued Trups are themselves subscribed to CDOs which the Volcker rule now includes in the list of funds which are subject to investment restrictions, the newspaper warns.
