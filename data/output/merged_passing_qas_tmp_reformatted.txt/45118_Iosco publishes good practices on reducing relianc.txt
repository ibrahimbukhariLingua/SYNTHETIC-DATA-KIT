Iosco publishes good practices on reducing reliance on rating agencies in asset management


The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) on June 8th published its final report on Good practices on reducing reliance on CRAs in Asset Management, which provides a set of good practices for reducing over-reliance on external credit ratings in the asset management industry. The report stresses the importance of asset managers having the appropriate expertise and processes in place to assess and manage the credit risk associated with their investment decisions. To help managers avoid over-reliance on external ratings, the report lists eight good practices that they may consider when resorting to external ratings. The manager’s internal assessment process should be regularly updated and applied consistently. When assessing the credit quality of their counterparties or collateral, asset managers should not rely solely on external credit ratings and consider alternative quality parameters (e.g., liquidity, valuation, correlation, etc.). Where external credit ratings are used, a downgrade should not automatically trigger the immediate sale of the asset. Should the manager/board decide to divest, the transaction is conducted within a timeframe that is in the best interests of the investors.In the report, IOSCO notes that the use of external ratings by asset managers is mainly demand-driven, as various forms of reliance on external credit ratings remain on the investor side. References to external credit ratings may derive from regulatory requirements or an investor’s own internal rules. To address these concerns, IOSCO recommends that the Financial Stability Board consider potential ways to reduce possible investor overreliance on external ratings.
