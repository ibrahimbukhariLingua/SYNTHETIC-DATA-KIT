AXA research fund grants fist financing in Asia


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The AXA fund for research announced on 2 December that it has granted EUR517,000 in support (slightly over SGD900,000) for three years to the National University of Singapore (NUS) for a research project on the “biology of decision-making in risk conditions.” The grant is the first support by the AXA fund for research at an Asian university. AXA explains in a statement that the research project aims to better understand the biological mechanisms which cause differences in behaviour between individuals when they are confronted with risk, using methods drawm from behavioural and experimental economics as well as the biological sciences. The study will establish quantitative phenotypes which may represent a significant advance in the understanding of the molecular architecture of human decision-making in an uncertain environment. The project will be led by professors Richard P. Ebstein and Soo Hong Chew, of the departments of Psychology and Economy at NUS. The AXA research fund, founded in 2008, supports research to foster comprehension and prevention of risks to the environment, human life and human societies. It is a major and innovative initiative for scientific research in Europe, with a five-year budget of EUR100m. As of 29 October 2010, it had pledged EUR42m, and awarded financing to 192 research projects, undertaken in 17 countries by researchers of 39 different nationalities.
