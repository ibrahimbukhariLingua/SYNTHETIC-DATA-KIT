UBP and Syz reportedly plan to merge


Union bancaire privée (UBP) is reportedly about to acquire the Geneva-based private bank Syz & Co, according to the Swiss magazine Bilan. The agreement in principle has already been signed. UBP already acquired the Swiss activities of ABN Amro in 2011, and of Lloyds in March this year. Assets under management at Syz totalled about CHF25bn as of the end of December 2012. At UBP, Jérôme Koechlin, a spokesperson contacted by Bilan, had no comment. The bank simply says that it is in talks with Syz to share common services. At Syz bank, the reports are refuted: “We have to date signed no agreement with this bank, nor with any other establishment elsewhere,” says Ricardo Payro, a spokesman for Syz.
