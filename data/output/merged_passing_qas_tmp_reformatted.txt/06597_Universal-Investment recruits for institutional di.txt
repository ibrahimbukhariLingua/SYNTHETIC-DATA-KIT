p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } With the recruitment of Giovanni Gentilcore (ex Allianz Global Investors) and Matthias Eizenhöfer (ex Vontobel Europe) as senior sales managers, Universal-Investment has added to its distribution team dedicated to institutionals, led by Ralf Bräuer. The recruitments follow a strong increase in demand, with assets of EUR124bn as of the end of September, an increase of EUR20bn in twelve months, mostly from institutional investors. The two new recruits will be in charge of distributing master funds, institutional funds and complementary services such as securities lending and risk reporting. Bernd Vorbeck, chairman of the executive board, says Universal-Investment is planning to further develop its services to institutional clients, to offer custom solutions in the three divisions of administration, risk management and insourcing.
