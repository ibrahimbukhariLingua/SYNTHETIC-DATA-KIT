Libor scandal: Crédit Agricole denies involvement


Crédit Agricole has published a statement on its website denying reports which appeared yesterday in an article in the Financial Times claiming that traders at French banks, including Crédit Agricole CIB, may have been implicated in a scandal surrounding manipulations of the interest rate reported by Barclays between 2005 and 2009. Crédit Agricole S.A. states that it was not a member of the Libor panel between 2005 and 2009, and that it only became a member of the body in 2010. It also only contributed to the USD Libor from February 2011, and responded to requests for information from various authorities, “as is customary,” the firm state, adding that it has not been named in any complaints.
