Asian HNWI headcount increased by nearly 10% in 2010


The population of high net worth individuals (HNWI) in the Asia-Pacific region increased by 9.7% in 2010, to 3.3 million, for the first time giving the region more HNWI than Europe, and putting the region in second place after North America, according to the 2011 Asia-Pacific Wealth reports, published on 13 October by Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management and Capgemini. The wealth of HNWI in the region increased by 12.1% last year, to USD10.8trn, compared with USD10.2trn for Europe.The top three countries in the region, Japan, China and Australia, represent 74.4% of the high net worth population, and 68.2% of wealth. Japan remains by far the largest HNWI market in the region, with 52.5% of the HNWI population, and 38.2% of the wealth. China is in second place in the region, and fourth worldwide, with 535,000 high net worth individuals, up 12% year on year.The two preferred asset classes for high net worth clients in the region, excluding Japan, are real estate and equities. The proportion of assets represented by real estate was 27% in 2010, compared with 26% the previous year. Most real estate investments were in residential properties. In China, the proportion of real estate assets going to residential properties was as high as 70%.Equities represented 26% of investments by high net worth clients in 2010, compared with 27% the previous year. Chinese high net worth clients are particularly exposed to equities, with a proportion of 42%, compared with 19% in Japan.In 2012, high net worth clients are expected to increase their exposure to equities and bonds, while also reducing assets in money markets. Exposure to real estate is expected to fall to about 20%, due to the rapid increase in values observed in the past few years on many markets, which suggest that a significant correction may be coming.
