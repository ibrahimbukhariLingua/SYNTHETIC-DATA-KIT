Dorval AM renames Dorval Flexible Monde fund


Dorval Asset Management (Dorval AM), a 50.1% affiliate of Natixis Asset Management, has announced a decision to change the name of its fund Dorval Flexible Monde, to become Dorval Global Convictions. The name change aims to “reposition the international flexible fund within the ‘Convictions’ range,” the asset management firm explains in a statement. Dorval AM is seeking to structure its fund range in two strong brands: the “Convictions” range of flexible funds, and the “Manageurs” range for its European equity expertise. Dorval Global Convictions is a wealth fund which aims for “performance in line with global economic growth through an original management process,” the asset management firm states. It is a multi-asset flexible fund which invests directly in equities, without a geographical allocation constraint, with positioning that evolves according to the economic and financial convictions of the managers. The vehicle is co-managed by Sophie Chauvellier and Gustavo Horenstein, with François-Xavier Chauchat in charge of the strategy of the fund. Since the beginning of the year, the “Convictions” range of flexible funds has attracted EUR218m in subscriptions. Meanwhile, the “Manageurs” range has taken in EUR600m in inflows since the beginning of the year, taking it over EUR1bn in assets under management.
