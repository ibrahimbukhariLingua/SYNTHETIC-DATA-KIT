IFP Fund Management becomes Mirante Fund Management


The asset management firm IFP Fund Management SA, specialised in convertible bonds, and founded in 2003 by Giuseppe Mirante, is changing names, following a management buyout, according to a statement from the firm. It will now be known as Mirante Fund Management SA (MFM). As of 15 August, the two IFP funds, which are actively managed and licensed for retail sale in Switzerland in several share classes, will also be renamed, and will be relaunched under the name MFM. However, the ISIN numbers, depository bank and administrator of the funds will not change. Assets under management by the firm currently total CHF470m, of which CHF320m are for its flagship product, the IFP Global Convertible Bonds fund. Giuseppe Mirante, 42, and Alexis Martin, 32, will lead the firm based in Buchillon, while Markus Bossard, 43, Gianfranco Iuliano, 37, and Matthias Neubrand, 29, at the Zurich offices, will pursue the firmâ€™s proven strategy of conservative and traditional orientation in portfolios and convertible bonds, with an emphasis on controlled and constant growth, both for house funds and for special mandates from institutional clients.
