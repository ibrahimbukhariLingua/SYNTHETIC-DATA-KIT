Nearly one out of three new German funds survive for less than five years


Of 9,928 funds launched n Germany from 1 January 2000 until the end of 2012, 14.7% did not make it to their third birthday, 21.8% were closed in four years, and 28.7% had to be liquidated without being able to complete their fith year. The main reason for these high attrition rates calculated by the Berlin-based ratings agency Scope is inadequate performance.The newly-created funds only very rarely offer results higher than those of already existing products, which is often due to a lack of genuine innovation in the concepts, and also to a high level of cost compared with the limited volume of assets in the new funds.The categories of funds most severely affected by liquidations are money markets and equities, with attrition rates of 38.1% and 29.8% after five years, respectively.
