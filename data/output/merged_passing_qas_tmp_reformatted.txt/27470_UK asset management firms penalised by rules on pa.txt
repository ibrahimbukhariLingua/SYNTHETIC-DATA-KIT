UK asset management firms penalised by rules on payments to brokers


Earlier this year, the Financial Conduct Authority notified asset management firms that it would not tolerate any use of commissions paid by client to pay brokers to have them hold meetings with their client businesses, Financial Times fund management reports. The result is that UK firms are afraid that this will penalise them compared with foreign asset management firms, which can still pay for meetings with directors of companies, particularly in emerging countries, where access to businesses is difficult.
