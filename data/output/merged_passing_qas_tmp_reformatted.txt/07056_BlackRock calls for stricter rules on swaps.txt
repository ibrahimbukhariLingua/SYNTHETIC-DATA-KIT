BlackRock calls for stricter rules on swaps


BlackRock has recommended that regulators set stricter rules for clearing privately traded swaps than those that apply to the clearing of exchange traded futures, writes the Financial Times.The fund manager is concerned that rules being drafted might not be tough enough and could leave it too heavily exposed to the default of other investors. The point of contention is whether customer assets and margin payments towards cleared derivatives positions are held in pooled accounts or in segregated, accounts. BlackRock favours segregation.
