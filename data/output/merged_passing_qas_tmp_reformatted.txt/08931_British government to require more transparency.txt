British government to require more transparency


The British government is planning to require institutional investors to disclose their voting policies for general shareholdersâ€™ meetings. In the draft budget submitted last week, the government says that it would like to study the possibility of requiring institutional investors to publish all information about their votes, Responsible Investor reports. The government has also launched a consultation on the role of pension funds and insurers in the determination of pay scales in the finance sector.
