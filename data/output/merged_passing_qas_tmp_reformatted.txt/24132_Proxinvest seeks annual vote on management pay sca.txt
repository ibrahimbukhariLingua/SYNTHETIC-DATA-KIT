Proxinvest seeks annual vote on management pay scales


The chairman of Proxinvest, Pierre-Henri Leroy, is calling for more transparency about management pay scales. France may once have been a leader in areas of governance, but it “still has a long way to go to catch up,” says Leroy, announcing the publication of the 13th Proxinvest annual report on management pay scales in the SPF 250, and the first ECGS report on European management pay scales.In order to restore trust between shareholders and management, Proxinvest proposes three priorities, and suggests that voting should be annual on management pay scales (so-call “say on pay”), or else a remuneration report at general shareholders’ meetings. This annual vote, whether it be informational or binding, has gradually become a legal requirements, in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway. Proxinvest suggests that France should be inspired by the Dutch model, which has led to good elvels of dialogue between issuers and investors.Another priority would be to provide information on the pay tables about the individual cost of additional supplementary retirement schemes in addition to the complementary plan, in line with the transparency of major European firms. The quality of performance conditions also need to be improved, with the introduction of more long-term criteria, for example, looking over at least three years for option or equity plans, and quantifying the objectives in order to allow shareholders to verify performance.
