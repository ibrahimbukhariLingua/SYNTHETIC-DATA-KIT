AIMA responds to criticism of performance of hedge funds


The international alternative asset management association (AIMA) has published a new guide to better understanding the performance of hedge funds. The document, entitled “ Apples and apples: How to better understand hedge fund performance,” points out that comparing the performance of a hedge fund with that of the S&P 500 index may be likened to a comparison between apples and oranges. The guide suggests that it is more relevant to focus on risk-adjusted returns, which show that hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 (US equity), MSCI World (international equity) and Barclays Global Aggregate ex-USD (international bonds) benchmarks on a risk-adjusted basis. Even during the market rally of the past few years, hedge funds did better than the S&P 500 and the MSCI World.
