Aberdeen to add to bond product range


Aberdeen Asset Management is planning to launch two new bond funds next month, one of which will invest in Asia (Asian Bond Fund), and the other in pan-european high yield bonds (Aberdeen High Yield Bond Fund), according to Funds Strategy. A few days ago, Aberdeen announced the launch of an onshore bond fund covering emerging markets. The two funds will be structured as British OEIC products.
