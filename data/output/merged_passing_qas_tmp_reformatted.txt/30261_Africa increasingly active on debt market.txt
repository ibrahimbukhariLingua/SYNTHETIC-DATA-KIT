Africa increasingly active on debt market


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The financial ratings agency Standard & Poor’s on 13 May announced the publication of a special edition of its CreditWeek weekly newsletter dedicated to Africa, and particularly to the use of international capital markets by sub-Saharan African countries. Although a few years ago, South Africa was the only country in the region to be active on capital markets, seven other African countries have turned to international markets since 2007 for issues totalling nearly USD5bn. This trend has accelerated in the past two years. Standard & Poor’s has also published a study on regulations, now being created, for covered bonds in Morocco (“Morocco Looks To Covered Bonds To Support Housing Finance,”) which may serve as a basis for the first bond issues of this type in Africa.
