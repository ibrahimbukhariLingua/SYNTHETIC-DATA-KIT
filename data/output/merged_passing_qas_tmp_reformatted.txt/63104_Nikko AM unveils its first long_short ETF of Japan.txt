p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Japanese asset management firm Nikko Asset Management (Nikko AM) on 20 February announced that it has launched the Listed Index Fund MSCI Japan Equity High Dividend Low Volatility (Beta Hedged), an ETF which adopts a long/short strategy targeting Japanese equities. It is the “first ETF of its kind in Japan,” Nikko AM states. The new vehicle will be launched on 9 March and will be available on the Tokyo Stock Exchange from 13 March. The new ETF will invest in a portfolio of equities consisting of Japanese stocks with high dividend yields, which serves to reduce volatility. Meanwhile, the fund will adopt short positions on futures, to reduce sensitivity to volatility in market prices, Nikko AM says in a statement. The fund will be tied to the Long Short Strategy index on the MSCI Japan IM Custom (Price) 85% + Cash (JPY) 15% index, Nikko AM states. In this index, the long/short strategy for Japanese equities and the liquidity component are weighted with 85% and 15% respectively. “This long/short strategy concentrates on Japanese high yield and low volatility equities,” the asset management firm adds. The index also excludes all financial stocks, such as banks, insurers, brokerages, in addition to Japan’s real estate investment trusts.
