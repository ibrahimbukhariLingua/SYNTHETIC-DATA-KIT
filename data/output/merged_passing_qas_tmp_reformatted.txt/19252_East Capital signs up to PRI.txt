East Capital signs up to PRI


East Capital became a signatory of the United Nations-backed Principles of Responsible Investment (PRI). Louise Hedberg, who is head of corporate governance at East Capital, explains why signing PRI is an important step. “We believe that developing our investment process to consider relevant and material ESG factors will help us reach more well informed investment decisions, which hopefully will translate into even more attractive long term returns for our clients. East Capital already has certain exclusion criteria in place which means that we do not invest in any companies known to generate a significant part of their revenues from producing or selling weapons, tobacco or pornographic products. Rather than exclude companies that are lagging in ESG issues, East Capital prefers to initiate a dialogue to try to induce improvements and build readiness.”
