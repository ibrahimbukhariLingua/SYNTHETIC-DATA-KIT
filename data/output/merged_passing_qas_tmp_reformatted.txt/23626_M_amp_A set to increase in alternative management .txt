M&amp;A set to increase in alternative management industry


Asset management firms are increasingly seeking opportunities in niche activities, which means that in 2012, merger and acquisition operations may increase in the alternative management sector, the research agency Cerulli Associates predicts.Despite an encouraging year, activities in the asset management sector have remained moderate in 2011, due to a volatile and uncertain environment. The total value of all transactions last year represented USD17.3bn, down about 5% compared with the previous year.M&A deals in the alternative management sector may rise again this year for several reasons. First of all, major banks are divesting, in order to trim back their balance sheets to comply with new prudential regulations. Secondly, there has been an increase in interest in acquisitions in alternative management due to an increase in allocations to this asset class, largely from institutional investors.Another reason to bet on alternative management is that possibilities for distribution have been multiplying in Europe an Asia via UCITS vehicles. Lastly, ETF providers, whose popularity is set to increase, may also become attractive targets. So far, few transactions have been completed despite the interest expressed by some parties for independent firms which donâ€™t have the means to develop their activities themselves.
