Institutionals interested in custom indices


According to a survey undertaken in August and September 2011 by Northern Trust, with the assistance of Greenwich Associates (Customized Beta: Changing Perspectives on Passive Investing”), institutional investors worldwide who are increasingly preferring passive strategies are also increasingly interested in custom indices to help them achieve their performance objectives.Of 121 institutional investors surveyed (with a total of over USD500bn in assets), 40% estimate that “custom beta” plays a major role in their portfolio construction models, while 51% say they are disposed to study the possibility of using custom indices to achieve their objectives, but only 22% have already evaluated this method.For respondents, the custom beta approach presents two major advantages: an improvement in the risk/reward ratio, on the one hand, and increased diversification on the other.Additionally, the advantages of customised beta are perceived differently in different regions. European institutional investors see it as a way to increase transparency and to more easily reach objectives for socially responsible investment.For Asian investors, they provide a way to increase the efficiency of portfolios by eliminating methodological biases and weighting of traditional indices.In North America, respondents estimate that custom beta is primarily a good way to achieve exposure to new markets.
