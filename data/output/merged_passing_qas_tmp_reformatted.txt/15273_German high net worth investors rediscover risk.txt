German high net worth investors rediscover risk


Hakan Strängh, head of private banking operations at JP Morgan for Germany and Austria, says propensity to risk-taking by investors has increased in the past few months: they are choosing to convert their liquid assets into equities or high yield bonds. In addition, he says, clients’ confidence in their wealth manager is on the rise, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports.JP Morgan accepts only clients with wealth of at least EUR25-30m, of which EUR10m must be in liquid assets.The two major trends among clients at present are a rediscovery of domestic markets, Dax and Mdax equities, and investments in emerging markets. The latter are not limited to China, and also include Latin America.
