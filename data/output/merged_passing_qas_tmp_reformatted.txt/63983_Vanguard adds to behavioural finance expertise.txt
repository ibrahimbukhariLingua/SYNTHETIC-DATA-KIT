Vanguard adds to behavioural finance expertise


Vanguard, already active in the field, has given new impetus to its research activities in behavioural finance, with the creation of a new dedicated centre. The Center for Investor Research (CIR) will initially be dedicated to the study of the behaviour of individual investors and the way in which they take their decisions, with studies which exploit Vanguard databases and the digital universe.The structure represents a new step for the Vanguard Center for Retirement Research, whose proprietary research analyses the behaviour of participants in defined contribution pension regimes. By engaging in this new ares, the CIR continues its research in the area of pensions, a statement says.
