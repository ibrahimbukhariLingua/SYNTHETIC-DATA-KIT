DoubleLine launches bond fund with «Shiller» equity component


With the DoubleLine Shiller Enhanced CAPE, the US asset management firm DoubleLine on 31 October launched a fund managed by its CEO and CIO, Jeff Gundlach, as well as by Jeffrey Sherman, an asset allocation specialist. The product will actively invest 100% of its assets in debt instruments, but a part of these securities will be used as collateral against derivatives exposing the fund to the four most undervalued sectors of the US equity markets according to the cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio (CAPE). The management of the fund will also incorporate the long-term value investment principles developed by Robert Shiller, winner of the 2013 Nobel prize in Economics.With this leverage, the managers will obtain exposures similar to the index and debt instruments. Each component may represent up to 100% of the net asset value of the fund. The objective is to outperform the Shiller Barclays CAPE® US Sector TR USD Index.Insofar as the derivative strategy will leave s substantial portion of assets in the fund available for other investments, DoubleLine will make an effort to manage debt securities in order to produce additional returns over the long term. Since these debt instruments may be similar to those in the DoubleLine Core Fixed Income Fund, DoubleLine is permitted to invest a part of assets in the new fnud in the existing DoubleLine Core Fixed Income Fund instead of investing them directly in a portfolio of debt instruments.The DoubleLine Shiller Enhanced CAPE is available in I-class shares (ticker DSEEX) for institutionals, and N shares (DSENX) for retail invetors. The total expense ratio is limited to 0.66% and 0.91%, respectively, while the minimal subscription is USD100,000 in the former and USD2,000 in the latter case.
