DeAWM launches a low-cost ETF range


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management (DeAWM) is launching the “Core ETF” range, which will have a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.09% per year, or 9 basis points. The low-cost range includes ETFs which are already part of the offerings from the asset management firm, but which will have their fees reduced. This includes the X-trackers FTSE 100 UCITS ETF (DR), whose TER will be cut from 0.30% to 0.09% per year, and the db X-trackers DAX® UCITS ETF (DR), whose TER will be lowered from 0.15% to 0.09% per year. The 9 bp range will be complemented by the db X-trackers Eurostoxx 50 (DR), which will soon (during 1st quarter 2014) be converted to physical replication and will be complemented by another ETF of the MSCI USA index. “With this range of low-cost ETFs, we are seeking both to improve our range of current investors, and to extend our base of investors. With low TER, liquidity, transparency and visibility, this new range will interest a wide range of investors,” says Reinhard Bellet, head of DeAW Passive Asset Management, in a statement. With this initiative, DeAWM is entering the price war on the ETF market, which already involves Vangaurd, BlackRock and Lyxor.
