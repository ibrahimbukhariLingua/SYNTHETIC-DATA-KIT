Skandia IG to serve the Netherlands from Paris


Bogdan Popescu, head of distribution in France for Skandia Investment Group, will now serve the Netherlands, in addition to Monaco and France. The firm was not previously represented in the Netherlands. It will offer sub-funds of the Skandia Global Funds Sicav, which are already available in France. These will be aimed primarily at the major financial institutions based or present in the Netherlands, as well as family offices and institutional investors. Popescu will continue to be based in Paris.
