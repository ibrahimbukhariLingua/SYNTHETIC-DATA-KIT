Europe - Hedge funds: France decries ?offshore fund Trojan horse?


In an interview with Le Figaro, Christine Lagarde explains why the European directive on hedge funds does not satisfy France. ?The point on which the bill is not acceptable is that the European Commission wants to set up a ‘mutual recognition’ system. This kind of system, which is based on a network of mutual agreements, would open the door to the arrival in Europe of funds from the Cayman Islands, which could never be controlled directly by the European Union. Then offshore funds could become a Trojan horse!? declares the economy and finance minister.
