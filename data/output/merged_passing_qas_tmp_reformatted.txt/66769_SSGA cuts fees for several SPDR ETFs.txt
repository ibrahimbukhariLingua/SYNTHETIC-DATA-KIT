SSGA cuts fees for several SPDR ETFs


State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) has announced several modifications to country SPDR ETFs which offer exposures to Canada, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom, including a reduction in fees from 0.30% to 0.14%. Additionally, the four ETFs will no longer replicate StrategicFactors smart beta indicates, but will instead replicate market capitalisation indices designed by the index provider Solactive. SSGA has also announced the launch of the SPDR Solactive Hong Kong ETF on 19 September, which replicates the Solactive GBS Hong Kong Large & Mid Cap index, a capital index which measures the performance of large and small companies in Hong Kong. p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; }
