Xenix offers fixed-fee ETF-based management


The Berlin-based financial services firm Xenix Investor Services on Friday launched its new range of Xenix Investor Services, aimed at retail and institutional investors. The particularity of the new service is that it provides the client with custom strategic advising, constructing the portfolio exclusively from the bricks of ETF funds which replicate “high quality” indexes. The other unique characteristic of Xenix Investor Services is that it operates solely on the basis of a fixed pay scale, from a minimum of EUR200m. The formula includes six template portfolios which correspond to different risk profiles and priorities, but the portfolio may also be “customised.” In each of the type portfolios, Xenix will include ETFs from at least two different asset classes. The Xenix universe consists of 120 European ETFs. The Xenix company was recently founded by Mark Thomas, who was previously head of sales for Dow Jones Indexes and Stoxx Ltd. for the German-speaking countries, after working at Activest and Siemens KAG.
