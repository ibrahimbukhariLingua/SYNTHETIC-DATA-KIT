German fund population declined in 2011


Last year, 419 open-ended funds were launched in Germany, while 436 funds were closed, not counting closed-ended funds, according to statistics from the German BVI association of asset management firms. The number of new funds created has been at its lowest since 2005, with a peak in 2007 at 1,113 launches. In 2010, 482 funds were launched, while 389 were closed.Due to the development of the equities market, it is not overly surprising that the most negative population growth in 2011 was in the equity fund category, with 110 launches and 170 closures. However, creations of diversified funds totalled 128, while there were 93 closures.
