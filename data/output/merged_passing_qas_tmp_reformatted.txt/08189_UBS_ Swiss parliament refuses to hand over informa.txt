UBS: Swiss parliament refuses to hand over information to the United States


The Swiss parliament on 8 June rejected an agreement which would have delivered the names of thousands of UBS customers suspected of tax evasion to the United States authorities, and instead referred the bill to the Council of States, the upper chamber of the Swiss legislature. 104 members of the National Council, the lower chamber, voted against the proposal to accede to the United States demand for information about 4,450 clients suspected of evading US taxes, while 76 members voted in favour, after debates which were carried live on Swiss television. They also resolved that approval of the agreement, signed between the Swiss and US governments in August 2009, and challenged in January of this year by the Swiss courts, should be subject to an optional referendum. Under Swiss law, any citizen can raise a referendum on any law by collecting 50,000 signatures in 100 days.
