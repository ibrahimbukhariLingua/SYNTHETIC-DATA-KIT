Be wary of nervous managers


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Portfolio managers who are too afraid of losses tend to underperform overall, which can cost investors and their own careers, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing a soon-to-be-published study. As a result, when they recruit a manager, asset management firms should pay more attention to the criterion of aversion to losses, the authors of the study, Andriy Bodnaruk of the University of Notre Dame and Andrei Simonov of Michigan State University and the Gaidar Institute in Moscow, claim. The study is based on a survey of managers in Sweden, where researchers were able to gain access to the personal data of managers. “Managers are recruited on the basis of their past performance, their experience in their industry, their pedigree and other factors, but to our knowledge, their ability to face volatility in the value of their portfolios is never taken into account,” Dr. Bodnaruk regrets. Nervous managers can be costly: the study shows that managers who hesitate in the face of losses underperformed their apparently more courageous colleagues by 1.2 to 2.1 percentage points per year, and they are at greater risk of being fired.
