“We want to be representative, to be listened, and heard”


Newsmanagers: What are the issues the concern Af2i in Europe now?Jean Eyraud: We regret that the MiFID directive has had the consequence that there is still no real centralised and transparent source of information about product supply and demand for securities, transaction offers and volumes traded. Nobody wins, neither investors who lose out, nor issuers, who have no real visibility for their papers or their spreads. With so many regulated markets, and independent platforms under the control of 28 regulators, who receive an exhaustive mass of data which is still an unexploitable avalanche of strategic information, which is costly to exploit, how can we get where we want to be? We clearly need a single database, where all and sundry can access and use the information.Newsmanagers: What are your relationships with ratings agencies like?Jean Eyraud: Excellent, since we see the true value of the considerable work they do. We nonetheless feel that their opinions, whatever they may be, now have too much important resonance, and that current regulations in portfolio management make these ratings changes too pro-cyclical.Newsmanagers: Is Solvency II still a concern for Af2i?Jean Eyraud: About Basel III and Solvency II, I am struck by the fact that committees composed of highly respected people have clearly chosen to recommend a drastic reduction in global risk for banks and insurance companies, which is an honourable objective in itself, but without really taking the trouble to define or research who would by law or by deed be required to take the political initiative on that and become the third pillar of support for replacement and investment in high-risk assets.Newsmanagers: And what do you think of the financial transaction tax?Jean Eyraud: We feel that the planned tax on financial transactions is not well-adapted to the remedies it hopes to achieve, and to the problems we are seeking to avoid. Being the only country to impose such a tax would necessarily lead to a move of taxable transactions elsewhere, like what happened with the stamp duty.
