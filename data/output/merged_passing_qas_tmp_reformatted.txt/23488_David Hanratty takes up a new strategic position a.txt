David Hanratty takes up a new strategic position at Pioneer


David Hanratty, who joined the firm in January 2003, was appointed on 13 March as the sole director of institutional and wholesale distribution for the United Kingdom and Ireland and the Global Strategic Partners Group at Pioneer Investments. The two segments have been identified as important elements in the new five-year growth strategy announced by CEO Roger Yates. They have increasingly similar characteristics, and the creation of a single position for a director of both is a recognition of the importance of London in strategic selection by global platforms and institutional consultants.In practice, Hanratty will leave the Dublin hub to move to London, where he will lead a team of nine people focused on the UK and Ireland, located both in London and Dublin. He will also be in charge of five members of the Global Strategic Group in Singapore and London, and will coordinate with a specialist in New York for the offshore US market.
