Proposals to reform Norwegian fund


A committee appointed by the Norwegian government recommends that decisions by the Norwegisn sovereign fund (USD800bn in assets) to exclude companies or sectors for ethical reasons will be taken by the central bank of the country, the Financial Times reports. It is currently the Norwegian finance minister who takes these decisions, on the advice of an ethical board composed primarily of Norwegian professors. This system has sustained cirticism, since it leads to slow decision-making processes.
