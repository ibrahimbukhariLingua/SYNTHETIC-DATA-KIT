Energy manager leaves BlackRock


Daniel J. Rice, co-manager of USD4.4bn in assets invested in the energy sector at BlackRock, will be leaving the firm at the end of this year, the Wall Street Journal reports. The departure comes at a time when the newspaper had recently reported on potential conflicts of interest between private investments in the energy sector by Rice’s family and the natural resources portfolios which he managed for clients of the asset management firm. Rice Drilling, an affiliate of the Rice family company, founded a joint venture in 2010 with Alpha Natural Resources, a coal and natural gas company which later became one of the largest positions in the main fund by the manager. The fund’s losses on Alpha Natural Resources recently exceeded USD100m, or more than 20% of its decline in performance over the past year.
