Asset management expected to continue to support activities of Italian banks

According to Scope, 2014 will be the best year ever in the sector in terms of assets under management (EUR1.5trn) as well as net inflows (EUR31.7bn). The current year appears to be even more promising. In the first six months of the year alone, net inflows have totalled EUR95bn, taking into account open-ended funds and discretionary mandates. According to the author of the study, Marco Troiano, banking analyst, these strong inflows are expected to continue due to the expansionary policy of the European Central Bank, which is maintaining its interest rates on government bonds at very low levels, and its TLTRO borrowing allowances, which support the financing needs of Italian banks. Savings in Italian households, which are often invested in government bonds or banks, is expected to be increasingly channelled to higher-yielding products.
