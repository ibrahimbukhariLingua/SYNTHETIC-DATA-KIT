Asset managers should promote active management


European asset managers will need to restore investor interest in actively-managed investment products and strengthen the resilience of their business models if they are to improve performance post-crisis, says Fitch Ratings in a special report published on Tuesday. More than 50% of fund inflows in 2009 focused on corporate credit, emerging markets and commodities. In Fitch’s view, this reflects opportunistic allocation decisions to generate exposure to performing asset classes, rather than an active allocation to managed products. In other words, investors have looked to capture the “beta” rally of certain asset classes, rather than the “alpha” out‐performance generated by the manager. Because it has been opportunistically allocated, this new money is expected to be far less sticky and more easily substituted by exchange traded funds (ETFs). To address investors» lack of interest, Fitch recommends greater transparency on funds. «Transparency increasingly implies better access to decision makers — not just product specialists or marketing staff — to discuss positions, investment strategy and prices», says the agency. Also, regardless of whether it is retail or institutional, the right product will have to address investors’ changing perceptions of risk and return. Finally, Fitch suggests a tightening of the relationship between manager and investor. In order to improve the resilience of their business models, specialist managers will also require more flexible cost structures, which could be achieved via outsourcing, and lower break-even points. Generalist managers will need to increase critical mass on core or growing markets, diversifying the investors’ base and developing product mixes around all-weather products. Alternatively, they may deploy strong advisory capacities in order to keep assets in-house through market cycles, says Fitch. * European Asset Management: an industry under pressure
