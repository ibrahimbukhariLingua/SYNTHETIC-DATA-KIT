Feri creates a peer group for local currency emerging market bond funds


German rating agency Feri EuroRating Services has announced a modification to its classification of emerging market bond funds, with the creation of a special peer group for bonds in local currencies. The category includes a total of 22 funds as of 31 March. The peer group includes funds with at least 90% of their assets invested in government or corporate bonds from emerging markets. In addition, the proportion of bonds denominated in local currencies must be over 50%. Feri EuroRating Services also has an emerging market bonds category which includes mainly funds which invest primarily in international currencies, as well as a peer group for Euro-hedged emerging market bond funds.
