Mirova publishes first carbon footprint report for its investments in publicly-traded equities


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Mirova is for the first time publishing a report on the carbon footprint of its publicly-traded equity investments, representing total assets of EUR2.8bn, or 47% of assets under management, under commitments made as part of the Montreal Carbon Pledge and the Portfolio Decarbonisation Coalition. The measurement was made with the Carbon Impact Analytics methodology, co-developed with Carbon 4. The carbon footprint calculated in this way finds that, for the consolidated perimeter of equities held by Mirova, carbon emissions induced are 97 tonnes of CO2/million euros, or 56% lower than the European large cap benchmark; emissions prevented of 12 tonnes of CO2/million euros are identical to a European large cap benchmark. For a European environmental strategy which assigns a meaningful place to climate challenges, Mirova has announced emissions prevented three times higher than the benchmark (-43 tonnes of CO2/million euros, compared with -12 tonnes of CO2/million euros). This investment strategy realizes an ambition to align with a climate scenario which makes it possible to maintain temperature increases at 2Â° C.
