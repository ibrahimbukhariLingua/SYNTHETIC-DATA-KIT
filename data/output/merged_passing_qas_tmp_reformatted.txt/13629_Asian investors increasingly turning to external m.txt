Asian investors increasingly turning to external management


Institutional portfolios in Asia excluding Japan grew by 20% last year, to USD7.4trn, from USD5.4trn previously, as the percentage of assets given to external managers came to 15% of the total, or USD1.1trn, compared with 11% of the total in 2010, according to estimates from the research agency Greenwich Associates, released at an investor forum organised by Asian Investor and FinanceAsia. Not counting central banks and commercial banks, which manage most of their assets internally, the percentage of Asian institutional assets which are allocated to external managers accounts for more than 30% of the total. For the first time since 2008, investors have increased their allocation to equities for an average portfolio to 22%, compared with 13% last year. They have virtually doubled allocation to alternative management to 11%, compared with 6% previously. All of this works to the detriment of bond allocations. This trend is likely to continue in the next three years.
