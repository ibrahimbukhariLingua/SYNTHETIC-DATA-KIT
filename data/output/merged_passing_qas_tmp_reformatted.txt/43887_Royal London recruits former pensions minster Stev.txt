Royal London recruits former pensions minster Steve Webb


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Royal London group, a specialist in insurance and pensions, has recruited former pensions minister Steve Webb to the newly-created position of head of policy and external communications at Royal London. The appointment of Webb was announced at the end of July, but the group has now confirmed the reports and stated Webbâ€™s responsibilities. In his new role, Webb will be in charge of developing the policy of the group and overseeing its communications activities. The only minor inconvenience for Web is that his former responsibilities prohibit him from any lobbying activities for a period of two years starting from his appointment. Webb will begin in his new role on 9 November.
