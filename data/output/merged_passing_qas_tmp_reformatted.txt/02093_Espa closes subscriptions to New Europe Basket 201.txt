Espa closes subscriptions to New Europe Basket 2014 a week early


Erste Sparinvest (Espa) announced on Thursday that on 2 October, rather than 9 October, it will be closing subscriptions to its new fund of government bonds from countries of central and eastern Europe, entitled Espa New Europe Basket 2014 (see Newsmanagers of 15 September). According to the product manager, Edwin Triebling, the move comes as a result of high demand and a strong rise in the price of government bonds from central and eastern European countries recently. On the basis of current data, the fund is expected to return a minimum of 5% (it had initially aimed for returns of 5.25%). In light of the scale of demand, Espa is proposing to launch a new fund which will use the same investment strategy, with subscriptions to open for the new product on 9 November 2009.
