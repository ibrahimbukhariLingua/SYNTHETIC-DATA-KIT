Columbia Threadneedle Investments plans to increase visibility on European continent


Columbia Threadneedle Investments “is constantly looking for opportunities (acquisitions) which may arise,” Michelle Scrimgeour, CEO of Columbia Threadneedle Investments EMEA, says in the issue of Agefi Hebdo to appear on 12 October. “On the European continent, we are already one of the top 25 asset management firms,” the director adds. She says, however, that “in all circumstances,” the group will be selective. In the United States, it has already made two acquisitions in the past two years: Emerging Global Advisors, LLC, an asset management firm specialised in smart beta portfolios, and more recently, the real estate firm Lionstone Investments, based in Houston, Texas. Considering that the fundamentals of the business “are already strongly in place” with the integration of Columbia Management in March 2015, the CEO appointed five months ago off a career at M&G Investments and BlackRock, says the plan in future “will be for us to get to know each other better. We have a place as one of the large players.” Concerning Brexit, Scrimgeour says that she regrets the decision, but points out that her group has been “among the first in the sector” to announce that they will be reinforcing their base in Luxembourg and duplicating their British-registered fund range. As of the end of June, the firm had EUR414bn in assets under management, and over 2,000 employees.
