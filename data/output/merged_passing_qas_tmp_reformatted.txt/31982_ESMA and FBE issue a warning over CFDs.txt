P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA) on 28 February published a warning for retail investors about the risks related to investment in contracts for difference (CFD). In the current period of low interest rates, the two authorities say they are concerned by the temptation for inexperienced retail investors to invest in complix financial products, which they may not really understand, and which could cause them considerable losses. The warning is followed by a practical guide for retail investors, which provides information on the forex and trading via an online platform.
