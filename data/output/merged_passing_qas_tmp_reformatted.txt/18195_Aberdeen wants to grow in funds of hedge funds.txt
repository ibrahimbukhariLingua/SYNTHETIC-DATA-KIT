Aberdeen wants to grow in funds of hedge funds


Aberdeen Asset Management is planning to more than double the size of its funds of hedge funds business to USD10bn in the next few years, from USD4bn currently, Financial Times Fund Management reports. The news comes at a time when the alternative multi-management industry is under pressure. Andrew McCaffery, global head of hedge funds at Aberdeen, tells FTfm that the growth may come via acquisitions, or through the winning of new mandates.
