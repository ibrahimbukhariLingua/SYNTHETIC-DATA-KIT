Track records may be deceptive


Past performance is not a predictor of future performance – and, according to TCF Investment, past performance is not an indicator of past performance, either.In the past 12 years, FCF Investment explains, the investment fund sector has undergone a 100% turnover of the overall range of funds on offer to retail clients and their advisers. The most recent annual statistics from the British investment management association (IMA), which cover data up to the end of 2010, reveal that in that period, there was more or less one new fund created every day, while another fund was closed or merged. Over 12 years, 2,660 funds were launched, and 2,486 funds were closed or merged. As of the end of 1999, the total number of funds available was 2,437. As of the end of December 2010, the number of funds available was 2,574.According to TCF Investment, it is highly unlikely that the turnover rate observed took place for the benefit of clients. The costs which closure, merger or launch of funds entails must have totalled millions of pounds in tax, legal and other costs, which would ultimately have been borne by investors.It is also reasonable to conclude, TCF Investment continues, that closed or merged funds are products which failed to meet expectations. In the 12 years under review, about half of all funds were closed or merged in any given five-year period, which means that their track records would also have been deleted and are no longer featured in the performance rankings.In other words, “anyone who considers the average performance of the sector over a five-year period takes into account only 50% of all track records, and the best 50% at that,” says David Norman, CEO of TCF Investment Funds. This means that “past performance does not represent a reliable guide to past performance, to say nothing of future performance.”
