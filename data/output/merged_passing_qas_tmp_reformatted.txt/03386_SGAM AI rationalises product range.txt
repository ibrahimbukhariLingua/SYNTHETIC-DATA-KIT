SGAM AI rationalises product range


As the ongoing process of merging with Lyxor Asset Management continues, SGAM Alternative Investments (SGAM AI) is concentrating its product range, to focus on niche products with high trading volumes, explains Fran√ßois Millet, head of distribution. With this goal in mind, SGAM AI has decided to withdraw its ETF SGAM ETF T-Rex from trading on 12 June. The product, which replicates alternative beta (HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index), has limited liquidity, probably partly due to the fact that it was launched at an unfortunate time (23 September 2008), just after the bankruptcy of Lehan Brothers. Redemptions will be paid out on 3 August. However, the management firm will retain its FCP SGAM AI T-Rex Fund, as well as the SGAM AI Reverse T-Rex Fund and SGAM AI Leveraged T-Rex Fund.
