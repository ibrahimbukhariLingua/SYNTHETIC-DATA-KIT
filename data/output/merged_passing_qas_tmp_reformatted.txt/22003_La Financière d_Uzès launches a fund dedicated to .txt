La Financière d’Uzès launches a fund dedicated to fine wines


La Financière d’Uzès has launched the Uzès Grands Crus fund, a French-registered contractual FCP fund dedicated to fine wines.The fund, founded by the asset management firm Uzès Gestion, is open for subscriptions until 30 November 2012, and aims to earn a rate of return over 5 years higher than French bonds with the same maturity, due to active management of a portfolio of fine vintage wines (at last 75% of assets), a statement says. The portfolio will be at least 50% invested in major wines from Bordeaux and Bourgogne, while the remainder will be invested in high quality wines from the Rhône river valley or foreign countries (primarily Italy, Australia, Spain, and the United States).Although it is not strictly the objective of the fund, the Liv-Ex Fine 100, the benchmark index for the fine wine market, has gained 11.99% per year between July 2001 and July 2011. Even with the recent correction taken into account, the trend remains positive (+11.50% from April 2002 to April 2012), La Financière d’Uzès states.CharacteristicsLegal format: French-registered FCP fundType: Closed contractural OPCVM fund reserved for qualified investorsMaturity: 5 years, with a 12-month lock-in periodBenchmark: average monthly returns on 5-year OATsInitial net asset value per share: EUR5,000Minimal initial subscription: 6 shares, for qualified investorsSubcription period: 1 June to 30 November 2012Subscription commission: maximum 4% of net asset value not paid back into the fundManagement fee: maximum 3.5% of net assetsPerformance commission: 25% of returns exceeding benchmarkRedemption commission, not paid back into fund: 5% of net asset asset value in the first year, 4% in the second year, 3% in the 3rd year, 2% in the 4th year, 1% in the 5th year, 0% in subsequent yearsMaximal redemption: 20% of assets per yearDeposit: in a secured vault, certified ISO 9001 for wines and spirits, at ports Francs in Geneva
