Insurers commit EUR690m to financing SMBs


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The “France Investissement Assurance” partnership, launched on 22 February 2012 by CDC Entreprises (an entity which is a part of Bpifrance) in collaboration with five insurers - Allianz France, Axa France, BNP Paribas Cardif, CNP Assurances and Crédit Agricole Assurances -, can claim a first triumph. Iin the space of three years, fewer than the four initially planned, insurers have engaged EUR690m to several investment funds dedicated to the financing and growth of small and mid-sized enterprises (SME). As part of the “France Investissement Assurance” partnership, insurers engage to finance independent SMEs by subscribing to investment funds whose strategy aims to meet three objectives: assist the most enterprising businesses, favour their growth and their internationalization. The partners at that time agreed to contribute between EUR620m anf EUR740m to French SMEs over a period of four years (2012 to 2015), via eligible investment funds carrying the “France Investissement Assurance” label. This was a winning bet. After three years of partnership, the insurer partners have selected 36 investment funds, for a total engagement of EUR690m. Venture capital funds (including seed capital) represent 24% of the total sums engaged, while development capital represents 63%. 150 businesses received investments, with a continuing objective of 500 to 600 eventually. These businesses are active in the manufacturing industries (36%), life sciences (24%), services (17%), information and communication technologies (15%), and ecological technologies (5%).
