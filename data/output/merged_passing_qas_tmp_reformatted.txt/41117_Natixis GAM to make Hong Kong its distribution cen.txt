Natixis GAM to make Hong Kong its distribution centre for Asia


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Natixis Global Asset Management (NGAM) is planning next year to transform its Hong Kong-based entity into an operational centre for all of Asia, concentrating in particular on distribution in China and liquid alternative products, the specialist website Asian Investor reports. The asset management firm has about 63 employees in Asia, including emerging market portfolio managers and operational teams, and is now seeking to add to its support and sales teams significantly in the region during the next two years. “We are just beginning to have fund distribution in Asia,” says Matt Shafer, head of international distribution at NGAM, in an interview with Asian Investor. “We would like to position ourselves for distribution in China, but we have not yet decided on our roadmap.” NGAM is also planning to launch at least two new funds aimed at Asian investors in 2016, including a long-short market neutral strategy, from its affiliate DNCA, and a managed futures fund from Alpha Simplex.
