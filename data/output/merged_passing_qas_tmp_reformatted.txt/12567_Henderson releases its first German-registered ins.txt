Henderson releases its first German-registered institutional real estate fund


One year after its release for sale, the British management firm Herderson Global Investors on 1 September announced the official launch of its German-registered institutional real estate fund, the Henderson German Retail Income Fund (HGRIF). The manager has already collected about EUR85m in investments from German insurers and pension funds, and from one Austrian institutional investor. That gives the fund an investment capacity of EUR170m, with leverage. The objective is to raise EUR150m in subscriptions, to invest EUR300m, largely in shopping centres. The objective is to generate a return on investment of at least 6% per year, with a portfolio which would include 10 to 15 properties. Meanwhile, Henderson has announced that it has acquired the Tuna Park Shopping Centre (126,400 square metres) in Eskiltuna, Sweden, for SEK558m, or EUR61m, from Alecta Pensionsförsäkring Ömsesidigt. The property will be added to the portfolio of the European Core Property Fund No. 1 from its German affiliate Warburg-Henderson.
