French equity funds see heavy outflows in mid-December


Funds dedicated to French equities in the week to 19 December posted their heaviest outflows since second quarter 2008, according to estimates by the research agency EPFR Global, which, however, has not disclosed the total sums in question. In general, European equity funds with a regional mandate generally performed well, although funds dedicated to one country had some difficulty in attracting new capital, EPFR Global comments. European equity funds overall, however, finished the week with inflows. US equity funds also saw inflows in the week to 19 December, such that equity funds overall posted net inflows of USD5.56bn. Meanwhile, bond funds overall finished the week with outflows of USD4.1bn, the strongest outflows observed since the beginning of August 2011. Redemptions from real estate, European and US bonds, were particularly high in the week to 19 December. In the United States, talks over the “fiscal cliff” have penalised municipal bonds, which have posted their heaviest outflows in early two years. Lastly, it should be noted that money market funds have posted outflows of USD18.8bn, while European money market funds represent 60% of this total.
