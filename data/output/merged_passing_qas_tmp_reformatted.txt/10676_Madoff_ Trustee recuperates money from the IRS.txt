Madoff: Trustee recuperates money from the IRS


Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee for Bernard L. Madoff Invstment Securities (BLMIS), has obtained a refund of USD326m in taxes from the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which were paid by Bernard Madoff to lend an illusion of legitimacy to his activities, the Wall Street Journal reports.Since the beginning of 2003, Madoff paid about USD330m to the IRS in the name of 145 foreign account holders who made dividends on their investments with Madoff. However, as the manager was fraudulent, he was not really paying such dividends, which would have been subject to withholding tax.The USD326m will be repaid to investors who lost money in the scheme.
