CheBanca! Launches a robo-advisor


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } CheBanca!, the retail bank of the Italian Mediobanca group, is launching YellowAdvice, a robo-advisor. The robotic adviser is not only at the service of banking advisers, but also open to all retail clients who can invest at least EUR20,000. “With Yellow Advice, we wanted to make a consulting service available to everyone which had previously been limited to private banks,” says Roberto Ferrari, CEO for CheBanca! Via Yellow Advice, the clients also have a way to manage their portfolio themselves, without the assistance of an operator, or with the support of a specialist either by telephone, by internet or on site, at a branch. The clients can also access financial education materials, and can perform simulations and play games. “The objective is to offer an advanced, 360-degree advising service, which can always be available remotely. This is a difficult challenge, and we think we have met it: today, more than 35% of our clients are accessing the world of asset management exclusively online,” Ferrari continues.
