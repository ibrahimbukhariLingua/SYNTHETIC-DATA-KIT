Money market funds well-prepared to retain their assets


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } European money market funds denominated in euros are now facing the prospect of negative interest rates, after an unexpected decision by the European Central Bank (ECB) to reduce its prime interest rate from 10 basis points to 0.05%. The financial ratings agency Standard & Poor’s claims, however, that asset managers are relatively well-placed to confront the situation. In a study released on 16 October (“Euro Money Market Funds are Well-Positioned to Retain Assets Despite Negative Yields,”) the agency finds that asset managers have a variety of tools to manage negative returns, due to a period of preparation which began in late 2012. However, investors remain invested in money market funds, whose net assets have continued to increase since late 2013. According to the study, money market funds remain attractive vehicles largely due to the quality of the credit assets, short-term liquidity and diversification which they represent.
