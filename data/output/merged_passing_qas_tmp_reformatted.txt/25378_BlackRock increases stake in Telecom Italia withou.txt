BlackRock increases stake in Telecom Italia without notifying Italian regulator


In an interview with Il Sole – 24 Ore, Giuseppe Vegas, chairman of the Italian financial market authority Consob, expresses surprise at BlackRock’s investment in more than 10% of capital in Telecom Italia, without the Italian regulator being informed. Consob immediately sought to contact the asset management giant, unsuccessfully. At the same time, it launched a formal demand for information and, in line with the rules in force, blocked the voting rights for the undeclared stake. Vegas is speaking of “informative manipulation.”
