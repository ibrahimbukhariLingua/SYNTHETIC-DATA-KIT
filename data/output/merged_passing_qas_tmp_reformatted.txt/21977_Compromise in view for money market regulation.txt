Compromise in view for money market regulation


At a meeting on 8 May in Washington, with -among others- representatives from BlackRock, JPMorgan, Vangaurd and Invesco, asset management firms have approached the SEC, which had sought to impose a 3% to 5% freeze for 30 days on redemptions from money market funds, the Wall Street Journal reports. The professionals claim that such a rule would be the death knell for the activity. As a compromise, they propose imposing a withdrawal penalty on redemptions made during “liquidity events” such as the financial crisis of 2008.
