F&amp;C goes from hunted to hunter


F&C Asset Management has become a completely independent publicly traded management firm, for the first time in its 140-year history, following Friends Providentâ€™s distribution of its 52% stake to shareholders, the Financial Times reports. While F&C had been considered an acquisition target when Friends was seeking to sell off its stake, the British management firm now finds itself in a position to acquire others. Alain Grisay, CEO, says F&C could act fast if it finds rare gems. The executive estimates that 15 European banks are no longer considering asset management a strategic activity.
