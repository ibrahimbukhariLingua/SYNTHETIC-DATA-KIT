p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } La Financière de l’Echiquier is launching the systematic management fund Echiquier QME, which aims for returns decorrelated from traditional assets, for sale to Italian retail clients. The strategy has existed for three years in a version reserved for professional investors (Echiquier QME Global). Echiquier QME, which complies with the UCITS directive, is based on a systematic quantitative management methodology which aims to earn returns both in rising and in falling markets, as well as in flat markets. With averange annual volatility of less than 10%, a statement released in Italy says. The fund invests in future contracts, subdivided into four asset classes for the UCITS version (equity indices, government bonds, interest rates, currencies) and, additionally, commodities in the case of Echiquier QME Global. The investment process, based on risk controlling, is implemented systematically with proprietary systematic models which combine two complementary startegies: a momentum strategy (for about 70% of the portfolio) and a satellite straetgy “whose algorithms represent about 30% of the allocation in the portfolio.” The fund is mmanaged by a team of two professionals who joined LFDE in 2013: Ludovic Berthe and Alexis Grutter, two veterans of HDF Finance.
