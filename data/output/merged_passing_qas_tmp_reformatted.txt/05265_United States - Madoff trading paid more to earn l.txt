United States - Madoff trading paid more to earn less


According to documents furnished by Lazard to potential buyers, pre-tax profits and earnings at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC declined in recent year by 923% and 54%, respectively, the Wall Street Journal reports. Never the less, salaries at the trading affiliate of the group increased by 11.5% in 2008 and 11% in 2007, although bonuses declined slightly in 2007. According to Tamar Frankel, a professor of law at the University of Boston, Bernard Madoff probably boosted the pay of his traders to give the impression that activities were robust and do avoid raising the suspicions as to the health of the group as a whole.
