PRI to integrate ESG principles for bonds


The United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI) network is in the process of setting up a working group for fixed income, which will aim to integrate ESG (environmental, social and governance) criteria into the government, corporate and municipal bond space, the organisation has announced in a presentation of its strategy and its working program for 2011-2013. The steering committee for the new project will be assembled by mid-2011. The PRI is also planning to create working groups for hedge funds, commodities and infrastructure, to set up responsible investment principles for these activities.
