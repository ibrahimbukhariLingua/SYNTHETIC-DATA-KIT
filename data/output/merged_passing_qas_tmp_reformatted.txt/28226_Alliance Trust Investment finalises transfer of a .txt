Alliance Trust Investment finalises transfer of a fund to the Caceis UCITS platform


The final phase in the process of transfering the invstment team and the Sustainable Future range of funds from Aviva Investors to Alliance Trust Investments has been completed. Since 26 July 2013, the Sustianable Future Pan-European Equity fund, which had previously been a part of the Aviva Investors Sicav, has joined Luxexcellence, according to a statement from Caceis. The fund, now known as the Luxcellence - Alliance Trust Sustainable Future Pan-European Equity Fund, is a sub-fund of the Luxcellence Sicav, the UCITS platform from the Caceis group. Alliance Trust Investments thus becomes one of the foremost asset management firms on the sustainable and socially responsible investment (SRI) market, with a portfolio consisting of one Sicav and seven British-registered open-ended investment companies (OEIC) with total assets of GBP1.37bn, or EUR1.58bn. The fund has outperformed its benchmark index by 5.85% as of the end of June 2013, and its cumulative performance comes to 43.82% as of the end of May 2013.
