Asset management firms lack originality in their communication


In terms of communication, asset management companies show little originality. Regardless of their size, they tend to communicate the same anodyne messages and interchangeable attributes, according to a white paper from the New York-based branding and marketing firm DeSantis Breindel («Do all investment managers tell the same story?: How brand differentiation drives growth”).According to a survey of the top 30 institutional asset managers carried out by the company, 57% of respondents describe themselves as “client-focused.” “There is certainly nothing wrong with being focused on the client, but this doesn’t buy a firm much in the way of differentiation,” the study remarks. “After all, if a plan sponsor believed that a firm wasn’t focused on their needs (including the need for higher returns), would they even consider hiring that firm in the first place? Doubtful,” it concludes.In the same vein, 47% of asset management firms call themselves “global,” 43% say they have “strong risk management,” 27% highlight their “disciplined approach,” 27% point to their “experience,” and 23% speak of “trust” and “transparency.”Without going into the long and complex process of building a brand, DeSants Breindel indicates that in order to create a brand which is able to stand out, it is necessary to start with in-depth research to uncover the attributes which genuinely differentiate a company, which matter the most to its main audiences, including clients, prospective clients, investors, and employees.
