SAC Capital pleads guilty in US court


US judge Laura Swain has accepted a plea of guilt from SAC Capital, and ordered it to pay a fine of USD1.8bn for insider trading, ending a long investigation which required the hedge fund firm to close its door to outside investors, the Financial Times reports. “The crimes committed by the defence were striking for their size and striking for their failure to respect the law,” the judge commented.
