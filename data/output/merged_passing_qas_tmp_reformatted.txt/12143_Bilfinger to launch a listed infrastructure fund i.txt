Bilfinger to launch a listed infrastructure fund in London


The German construction group Bilfinger Berger on 19 September announced plans to place up to EUR280m in a fund on the London Stock Excchange which would house infrastructure projects, in order to reduce the burden on its regulatory capital. It would retain at least 19.9% of the fund. The fund would “package” 19 public-private projects (PPPs) which currently involve EUR161m in equity from Bilfinger Berger, Handelsblatt reports.The prospectus for the fund may be ready in October, so that sales of the fund could begin in first quarter 2012. The group is expecting net inflows of EUR270m for the next fiscal period, of which EUR55m would be reinvested in the fund, while the book profit at Bilfinger Berger would be a maximum of EUR50m.
