No shadow banking by credit hedge funds, AIMA says


In a 25-page report entitled “The Role of Credit Hedge Funds in the Financial System: Asset Managers, Not Shadow Banks,” the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA) challenges the association by the G20 of credit hedge funds with entities related to “shadow banking,” on three main grounds.Firstly, they don’t operate in the shadows, but will soon be subject to strict regulations everywhere in the world. Secondly, these funds are not banks, and do not make any maturity transformation. Lastly, they are aimed at “sophisticated” institutional investors.In addition to these points, the hedge funds represent only a relatively modest volume compared with banks, use only limited amounts of leverage, and do not have implicit or explicit guarantees from taxpayers.According to the Association, credit or credit-related hedge funds represent one third of the global hedge fund sector, and they use a vast range of investment strategies, ranging from fundamental credit analysis and arbitrage to trading of complex derivatives.
