50 largest French CIF operators account for 47% of total turnover


As part of its oversight of CIF-format financial advisers, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) has for four years been collecting quantitative and qualitative information concerning their activities, and has been processing the data collected in this way. The 2017 summary of findings shows that there continues to be a high level of concentration in the sector, as the 50 largest CIFs out of the 4,641 declared account for 47% of total earnings, while the next 500 CIFs account for barely 27% of the market. Source: AMF The report also shows stable total earnings reported by CIF operators compared with 2016 levels, with a total of EUR2.6bn in 2017, with 27%, or EUR718m, for activities relating specifically to financial investment advising (CA CIF). This stability is largely due to an increase in the level of activity for actors in the market (+EUR283m), and the arrival of new players (+EUR46m), which offset the exit from CIF status of high-end advisers (-EUR332m). In 2017, the mean earnings for a CIF totalled EUR571,000, while the median was EUR145,000.

This association is responsible for collective representation and the defence of the rights and interests of its members, and for oversight and regulation operations respecting these actors. In 2017, Anacofi again accounted for the lion’s share of earnings, as the members of this association amount to 61% of overall earnings and 62% of CA CIF activities. This association is followed by CNCGP, with 20% of global earnings, and 17% of CA CIF advising activities, and CNCIF, with 13% of global earnings, and 13% of CA CIF activities.

The average number of employees per firm is itself stable, at 3.3 people per firm (3.4 in 2016). Among this personnel, the number of directors and “CIF employees” is 6,768 people (6,840 in 2016). Those holding these positions are subject to professional access conditions and a requirement for ongoing training on CIF regulations. From 2020, these persons will also be required to demonstrate minimal knowledge by examination (“AMF certification”) to be permitted to continue to provide investment advising services. Kickbacks represent the largest slice for CGPs As a function of the global activity, agencies have told the AMF what family of professions they considered themselves to belong to, given that their primary activity is the provision of wealth management or advising services to institutional investors and asset management firms. Unsurprisingly, in 2017, as in previous fiscal periods, the vast majority of firms, with a total of 4,295 firms, said they considered themselves to be providers of wealth management advising (“CF CGP”). The income for “CF CGP” operators is composed of kickbacks from front-end fees and from annual management fees, which represent 61% and 27% of the total CA CIF declared, with the remainder composed of fees paid directly by clients. These operators declared total income of EUR7.9bn, and assets following closure of the 2017 operating year of EUR43bn. On the basis of this data, the average reconstructed level of kickbacks is 4.00%, and 0.34% of management fees (3.08% and 0.51%, respectively, in the previous period). Concerning their activities, 1.078 CGP agencies, 25% of the total, report that they belong to a network or group. 93% also state that they have other legal status, either as in insurance intermediator (IAS), an intermediary for banking and payment service operations (IOBSP), status registered with Orias, or the realty transaction card (T card). In terms of product and service ranges, CGPs reported: - Having an average of seven partnerships with providers of financial instruments, and having advised an average of 11.9 different financial instruments in the period (with financial investment advising representing 60% of activities for CGPs in 2017), - Having an average of 2.3 partnerships with providers of investment services, and having advised an average of 2.4 different investment services in the period (with investment advising services representing 19% of the activities of CGPs in 2017), - Having an average of 1.6 partnerships with providers “of other financial investments” (meaning investments other than financial instruments), and having advised an average in the period of 2.5 different “other financial investments” (with advising “other investment products” representing 21% of the activities of CGPs in 2017.) Source : AMF CIF operators dedicated to institutional investors and asset managers gaining ground A final interesting point in the AMF report is that CIF operators specialised in advising institutional investors and asset management firms are growing fast. 267 such operators were reported to the regulator, compared with 179 in the previous period. Their earnings in 2017 totalled over EUR634m, up +51% in one year (+EUR214m). This growth is due to an increase in activity by existing players (+EUR186m), and the arrival of new players in this family (+EUR41m). Unlike CGP operators, CIF operators have a pay structure in which most income is in the form of fees for services (62%), compared with commission kickbacks (38%). nearly half of actors (123) say they receive only fees.
