Hedge fund manager accused of insider trading


Doug Whitman, a hedge fund manager at the Californian asset management firm Whitman Capital, was accused by the FBI on Friday, as part of the Galleon investigation, of making USD900,000 in illegal gains on shares in Google and Polycom between 2006 and 2007 through the use of insider information obtained from Roomy Khan and Karl Motey, who both pled guilty of insider trading in the Galleon case. The Wall Street Journal reports that Whitman was released on bail of USD1.5m, and that the SEC is also filing a civil suit against him.
