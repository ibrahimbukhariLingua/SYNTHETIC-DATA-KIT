UBP launches a new emerging market product range in France


It is now official: as announced in early September (see NewsManagers of 8 September 2017), Union Bancaire Privée (UBP) has confirmed the launch of a new strategy focused on government bonds, entitled UBAM – Emerging Market Sovereign Bond. The new product offering is available on the French market. The new fund, managed by Thomas Christiansen, is based on an approach that has been called innovative, which combines internal research and thematic analysis. “The objective is to evaluate interactions between global macroeconomic factors and the fundamentals in countries, so as to identify and capture additional sources of alpha,” UBP says in a statement. The strategy is based on both top-down and bottom-up stock picking, to offer exposure to government and quasi-government issues in strong currencies. The investment universe is composed primarily of issuers based in emerging countries. With this launch, UPB adds to its product range for emerging markets, which already includes three emerging market corporate bond strategies (UBAM - EM Investment Grade Corporate Bond, UBAM - Emerging Market Corporate Bond, and UBAM - EM High Yield Short Duration Corporate Bond), as well as an unconstrained strategy with no benchmark, which is highly flexible in terms of management of exposures (UBAM - Emerging Market Debt Opportunities). In addition to France, the strategy is available to investors based in Germany, Austria, Denmark, Spain, Finland, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Switzerland.
