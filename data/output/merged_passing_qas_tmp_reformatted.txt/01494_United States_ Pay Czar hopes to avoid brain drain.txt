United States: Pay Czar hopes to avoid brain drain


Les Echos reports that the controller of remuneration in the United States, Kenneth Feinberg, has expressed a desire to “take into account” the growing risk of a brain drain as talent leaves the United States. After calling for an average reduction of 50% to the pay scales of the 25 top directors of 7 major firms which received federal aid money, the “Pay Czar,” who will announce his decision about pay scales for 75 top directors at 8 firms within his jurisdiction by the end of the year, may not impose overly severe restrictions on the businesses in light of the brain drain risk he describes.
