AP1 awarded damages from BNY Mellon


The Commercial Court in London has handed down a verdict in favour of The Swedish pension fund FÃ¶rsta AP-fonden (AP1), which filed a suit in 2008 against BNY Mellon for reimbursement of losses occasioned by securities lending undertaken by BNY Mellon on behalf of the fund. The total damages were set at USD33.7m, or SEK219m, while the exact amount of the settlement remains to be determined. In addition, BNY Mellon will be required to reimburse AP1 for most of its legal costs related to the lawsuit.However, the US bank may still appeal.As the damages were entirely provisioned for in the annual accounts for AP1 in 2008, the damages and compensation for legal and interest expenses will have a positive impact on net investment income when the ruling goes into force.
