Nicola Horlick goes into private equity


An emblematic figure in the asset management industry in the UK, Nicola Horlick, has started up a new activity which aims to facilitate access to private equity for high net worth clients. Rockpool Investments, which Horlick is launching with two former heads from 3i, Gary Robins and Matt Taylor, will aim to take advantage of recent regulatory changes which aim to encourage investment in SMBs. Horlick, who is co-head of the new firm, will also continue to serve as chair of Bramdean Asset Management, a firm which she also founded. Horlick was in the news in 1997, when she successfully went head to head with her former employer, Deutsche Bank, which had suspended her from her position as managing director at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management on the grounds that she wanted to join a rival company with her entire team.
