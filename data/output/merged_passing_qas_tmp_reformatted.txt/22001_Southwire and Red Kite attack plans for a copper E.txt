Southwire and Red Kite attack plans for a copper ETF


The Financial Times reports that US based manufacturer Southwire and hedge fund Red Kite have complained in a letter to the SEC against a plan by JPMorgan du launch a copper ETF which could «wreak havoc» in the US and global economy by artificially inflating prices of the metal. In its filiang to the SEC, JPMorgan suggests its ETF could hold 61,800 tons of copper, which would be 27% of the metal held in the global network of warehouses of the London Metal Exchange. And BlackRock also plans an iShares ETF which could hold 121,200 tons. The paper however underlines that ETFs holding physical copper and launched in Europe over the last 18 months by ETF Securities (ETFS) and Deutsche Bank have had limited success. The ETFS product, for instance, only holds 3,427 tons.
