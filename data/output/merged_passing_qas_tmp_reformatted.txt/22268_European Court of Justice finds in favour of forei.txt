European Court of Justice finds in favour of foreign funds and against France


The European Court of Justice has announced a verdict. On 10 May, the Court announced that “the law of the Union opposes French regulations which impose national withholding taxes on dividends when they are earned by mutual funds domiciled in another EU country, when these dividends are exempt from tax for mutual funds domiciled in France.” Ten Belgian, German, Spanish and United States-domiciled OPCVM funds, which invest largely in shares in French businesses, and which earn dividends on these shares which are subject to withholding tax, had challenged the French regulation, which stipulated that dividends paid to non-French domiciled funds would be subject to a withholding tax of 25%, while the same dividends would not be taxed when paid to a French-domiciled fund. The estimated cost to the French budget is estimated at about EUR4.2bn as of the end of 2011.
