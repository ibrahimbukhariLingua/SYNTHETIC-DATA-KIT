ESG ratings should be handled with care


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } There is a “clear positive relationship” between an improving ESG rating (environmental, social, governance) at a business and performance, a study by NN Investment Partners, carried out in partnership with the European Centre for Corporate Engagement at the University of Maastrict, has found. However, final ESG ratings should be treated with skepticism, and should not be considered a good indication of what is to be expected in terms of perfomance, the study warns. “During the evaluation period the shares of those companies with the highest ESG scores tended in most cases to underperform lower-scoring counterparts»."The results have a number of critical implications for investors. Until now ESG scoring and its application has mostly been focused on absolute scores. This research reinforces NN IP’s longstanding belief that an absolute ESG score is insufficient to provide a complete understanding of a company’s ESG behaviours and the consequences for risks and returns,” Jeroen Bos, head of equity specialties at NN IP, says in a statement. “So far ESG scoring and its application in the investment industry has been one-dimensional, focusing on absolute ESG scores. This study opens up the debate as to whether a two-dimensional approach, combining absolute scores with ESG momentum is more appropriate,” Bos adds. Among other outcomes, the research also demonstrated that the exclusion of firms with controversial behaviour from the investment universe helped improve performance in the research period. “The exclusion of ESG controversies has been shown to be a relatively simple way to improve portfolio performance. Contrary to popular belief in the industry, it appears that exclusion can clearly enhance rather than harm investment performance, depending on the issues considered,” Bos says.
