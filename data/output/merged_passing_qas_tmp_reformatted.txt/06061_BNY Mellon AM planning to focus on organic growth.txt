BNY Mellon AM planning to focus on organic growth


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } “We actively participated in the concentration of the market in asset management, but that was not a path to a large-sized business for us: our objective was always to acquire the expertise that we did not have. Our most recent acquisition, of the British firm Insight (USD171bn in assets), was not motivated by the fact that Lloyds Bank needed cash, but rather that we did not have a specialist in liability-driven investment (LDI), and we wanted to strengthen our absolute return proposition.” So said Paul Feeney, global head of distribution, on Thursday evening in Paris, explaining the external growth strategy of BNY Mellon Asset Management (USD1.1trn), which now has 18 boutiques, all of them operating independently in their management style and/or asset class(es).“We are dedicated to filling the gaps that there may be in our product line, solely from a manufacturer point of view,” the manager says. The only centralisation which has been taking place group-wide is for distribution outside the United States, which employs a sales force of about 300 people. “But there is no global CIO at BNY Mellon AM: we have 18 CEOs.”“Currently, we don’t have any more significant gaps, and we are not really looking for more acquisitions. I admit that maybe we are missing an asset management firm specialised in Indian equities, but currently this type of management firm is beyond our price range, too expensive. We don’t have an ETF affiliate either, but that is not a part of our management doctrine, even though in Mellon Capital we do have a specialist in passive management,” Feeney told Newsmanagers.
