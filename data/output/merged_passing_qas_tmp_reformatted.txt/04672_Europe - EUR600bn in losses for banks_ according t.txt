Europe - EUR600bn in losses for banks, according to Nomura


European banks may be facing losses on domestic credit of more than EUR600bn, or 6.5% of Euro zone GDP, Nomura estimates in its most recent study of outlooks for the region.â€¯?This may paralyse lending for a period of time, but it is not necessarily insurmountable,? the study says.Nomura does not predict a single quarter of positive growth in GDP in 2009, although by the end of the year, monetary and budgetary support may begin to unclog the economy.
