Tikehau IM launches Tikehau Taux Variables


Tikehau Investment Management (TIM), an independent asset manager founded in December 2006 which specialises in dynamic bond management, has launched the Tikehau Taux Variables fund. The product’s objective is to “outperform the Euribor 3-month through exposure to bonds covering the full range of European private debt, on a mid-term horizon, with weekly liquidity reporting,” the manager says. The TTV fund is primarily invested in bonds issued by private and public firms and by financial establishments in the Euro zone, most of which are rated investment grade. The fund’s management team will “focus on securities whose value does not reflect the firm’s fundamentals.” It may also invest up to 35% in bonds rated below investment grade, and in bonds which are not rated.
