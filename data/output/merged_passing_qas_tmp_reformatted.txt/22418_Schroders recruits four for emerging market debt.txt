Schroders recruits four for emerging market debt


Schroders is expanding its fixed income team by appointing four senior professionals to develop its capabilities in the emerging market debt (EMD) relative return sector. James Barrineau has joined the New York office this week as head of Latin American fixed income and co-head of EMD relative (with Rajeev de Mello, head of Asian fixed income), Fernando Grisales as a senior portfolio manager and Alec Moseley as a senior portfolio manager and sovereign research analyst. James Barrineau will report to Karl Dasher, global head of fixed income and Fernando Grisales and Alec Moseley will report to James. These new appointments join from Ice Canyon, a California-based global investment management firm specialising in emerging markets and global credit investment strategies. Previously, they worked together at Alliance Bernstein where they shared responsibility for managing more than USD15 Billion in EMD relative return strategies. In addition, Chris Tackney will join next month as senior portfolio manager, emerging market corporate bond, reporting to Wes Sparks, head of US fixed income. Prior to joining Schroders he was an Asia credit trader at Credit Suisse, portfolio manager in the emerging market credit fund at Black River Asset Management and emerging markets portfolio manager at BlackRock Advisors.
