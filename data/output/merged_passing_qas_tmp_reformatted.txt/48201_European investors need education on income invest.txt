European investors need education on income investing


According to the results of a pan-European survey on income investing conducted for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, retail investors need instruction on this subject. The asset manager surveyed nearly 5000 individual investors with significant investable assets and found 67% claimed to be seeking some form of income, yet 52% could not correctly explain the meaning of the term «income investing». Among those who say they are not currently investing in income, the majority (61%) would like to know more about how they can generate income in their portfolios.Across Europe, just over half of investors are seeking a combination of income and growth. A third (33%) focus on seeking growth (particularly in the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Belgium), versus just 13% focused on generating income (all in Italy). French, German, Spanish and Swiss investors have a combination of these two objectives. French, German and Swiss investors are the most familiar with the subject of investment oriented to generating income.Investors tend to prefer equities and bank savings accounts for their income-generating investments, while mutual funds are popular in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden. Bank savings accounts are popular in Switzerland and the United Kingdom. France leads for insurance products (life insurance). Italian, Swedish and British investors are most likely to reinvest the income generated by their investments, while French and Swiss investors are more likely to place this income in cash. Lastly, German and Swiss investors prefer to spend the income generated.
