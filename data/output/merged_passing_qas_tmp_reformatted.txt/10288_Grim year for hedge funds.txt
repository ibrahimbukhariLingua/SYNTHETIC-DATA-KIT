Grim year for hedge funds


2011 will have been the second-worst year for hedge funds since 1990, while the worst remains 2008. Statistics from Hedge Fund Research (HFR) show that on average, these funds have lost 4.37% since the beginning of the year, which is not terribly severe, but must come as a shock for managers who are accustomed to earning absolute returns, the Financial Times notes.Nonetheless, Brevan Howard, the largest global macro fund manager, has stepped clear of outsized bets on the euro zone, and its USD24bn flagship fund has earned returns of 13% since the beginning of the year, largely due to big gains on US Treasuries in August. Meanwhile, the flagship fund from Bridgewater, managed by Ray Dalio, has made returns of 26%.
