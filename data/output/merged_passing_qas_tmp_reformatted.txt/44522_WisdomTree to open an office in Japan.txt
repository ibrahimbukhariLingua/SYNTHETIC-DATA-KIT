Koll will be responsible of ensuring the development of the asset management firm in Japan. At this stage, WisdomTree Japan is still pending approval from the local authorities to be officially registered on the Japanese market, but it hopes to be starting up its activities by the end of 2015. “For now, WisdomTree has no plans to create local ETFs in Japan,” the asset management firm says in a statement, however. Before joining WisdomTree, Koll was Chief Japan Equity Strategist and managing director responsible for Japanese equity research at J.P. Morgan in Japan. Before that, he served in a variety of roles as senior economist and strategist at Merrill Lynch and Tiger Fund in Japan. Koll has also served as member of several consulting committees for the Japanese government.
