Institutionals and IFAs make increasing use of alternative investments


The third annual survey by Morningstar and Barronâ€™s of the perceptions and use of alternative investments by 151 institutional investors and 669 independent financial advisers in the United States has found that use of this type of investment is becoming more popular, but that thevehicles used to invest in them are changing.Nadia Papagiannis, a strategist for alternative investments at Morningstar, says there have been USD2.7bn in net outflows in the first three quarters of 2010 from hedge funds monitored by Morningstar, while at the same time, net subscriptions to mutual hedge funds totalled USD17.3bn.Investors are seeking to reconcile the diversification offered by alternative strategies with the liquidity and transparency of publicly-traded vehicles. Managers are moving to meet this need, as hedge and commodity mutual fund products represented 14% of all funds launched in 2010, and 20% of all ETFs. Institutional investors prefer traditional mutual funds and ETFs toimplement their most liquid alternative strategies, but they continue to use hedge funds for less liquid strategies, such as arbitrage, distressed equities, and corporate actions.More than 70% of institutional investors surveyed predict that alternative products will represent more than 10% of their portfolios over the next 10 years, and 37% (compared with 25% in 2009) predict an allocation to alternative products of over 25%. More than half of IFAs predict that allocations by their clients to alternative products will increase by more than 10% per year in the next five years.
