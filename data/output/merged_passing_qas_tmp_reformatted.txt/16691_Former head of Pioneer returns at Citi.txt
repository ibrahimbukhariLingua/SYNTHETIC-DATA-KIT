Former head of Pioneer returns at Citi


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } There is once again talk of Dario Frigerio, the former CEO of Pioneer Global Asset Management, more than a year after he left the management firm of the Italian UniCredit group, which is now up for sale. His position there was subsequently given to the British Roger Yates, former CEO of Henderson. Frigerio has now been appointed by Citi as senior advisor to its investor services in the Global Transaction Services activity at the bank, a newly-created position. Frigerio will be based in Italy, and will provide strategic advising and will be involved in extending the firmâ€™s client base in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
