Italian fund association concerned about liquidation of real estate funds


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Assogestioni, the Italian association of asset managers, is predicting that in the next few years, about EUR5bn in real estate assets will be returned to the market in Italy. A high number of closed, publicly-traded real estate funds will be maturing, and will therefore need to manage the asset liquidation phase. Due to the current economic conjuncture, it is likely that the excess supply this will create will not be absorbed efficiently by the market, Assogetioni predicts. That may have negative effects on the final returns for the funds, and on the value of redemptions on capital invested, it warns. As a result, the association has written and sent a position paper to regulatory authorities in the country on managing the liquidation phase for real estate funds aimed at retail investors. The objective is to discern an operational solution for the entire sector, and measures which may be adopted by each actor.
