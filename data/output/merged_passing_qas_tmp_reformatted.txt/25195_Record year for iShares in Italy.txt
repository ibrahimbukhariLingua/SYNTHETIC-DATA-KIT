Record year for iShares in Italy


In 2013, iShares has had a record year in Italy, Emanuele Bellingeri, head of the ETF division of BlackRock for Italy, confirms in an interview with Bluerating. “In terms of assets, we have reached EUR13bn, and in the first ten months of the year, inflows totalled about EUR3bn,” he explains. “Taking into account only assets deposited in Italy, iShares has a market share of 53%,” he adds. Bellingeri predicts that 2014 will be marked by an acceleration in the use of ETFs by clients who currently use them less: institutional investors and distribution.
