Alliance Trust AM launches a European equity fund


Alliance Trust Asset Management has just launched the Alliance Trust European Equity Fund. The fund is managed by Fiona MacRae, head of European equities. It aims to produce long-term total return from investment in a portfolio of companies in any economic sector in Europe, excluding the United Kingdom. The Fund’s benchmark is the FTSE All World Developed Europe ex-UK Index (Total Return). The Fund is managed with a long term investment horizon. A high conviction stock-picking approach is key to the fund’s long term returns. While Fiona primarily follows a bottom-up investment process, there are times when themes and top-down issues are important and the portfolio will reflect these. The portfolio is concentrated around 25-35 holdings.
