EFAMA concerned about delays to planned PRIPS directive


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } The European asset and fund management association (EFAMA) has sent a letter to the members of the Economic Commission of the European Parliament to express concerns about the most recent developments concerning the planned PRIPS investment product regulations. It is true that the project, which is fundamental for the protection of investors and the creation of a more consistent space for the sales of retail products, has been on the negotiating table since 2007. EFAMA regrets that recent talks about PRIPS in the European Parliament have been increasingly distanced from the initial regulatory approach, which was that of the Commission, threatening the feasibility of the project overall. Among other things, says EFAMA, an extension of the perimeter to non-packaged products and the introduction of rules concerning eligible assets could render the bill inapplicable. It is also unlikely that a compromise will be found on reasonable time-frames, due to the divergences surrounding the parliamentary debate on a corpus of over 700 amendments. The new areas for discussion, which are not based on impact analysis, have not been subject to consultation either, which may be expected to considerably delay passage of the PRIPS regulations, the professional organisation predicts. EFAMA reiterates its commitment to the initiative and estimates that the Commission’s proposals represent a balanced basis, which could nonetheless be improved on some points, but which should not be completely thrown into question with an entirely new regulatory approach. EFAMA therefore invites members of European parliament to put the priority objectives of the project at the centre of their concerns, namely the publication of high-quality, standardised product information.
