Balanced funds dominate Swedish inflows in 2015


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } In 2015, funds on sale in Sweden posted net inflows of SEK84.2bn, or slightly over EUR9bn, the annual report from the Swedish investment fund association Fondbolagens Förening reveals. These inflows were boosted by balanced funds, which attracted SEK76.9bn. These annual inflows are below those in 2014, which totalled a record SEK152.8bn. But it is the seventh highest inflow since 1994, the Swedish association says. “The success of balanced funds is due to a year marked by extremely low interest rates and uncertainty on equity markets,” explains Fredrik Pettersoon, analyst in chief at Fondbolagens Förening. The other fund category to have been favoured by Swedish investors in 2015 was hedge funds, which attracted SEK11bn. However, equity funds have seen outflows of SEK2.6bn in 2015. In this area, it was primarily Swedish and international equity funds which suffered, with outflows of SEK12.6bn. Swedish equity funds also show net redemptions of nearly SEK6bn. However, global funds have seen inflows of SEK26.4bn. Outflows from equities, however, conceal a growing interest in passive management. In 2015, index-based funds posted net inflows of SEK23bn, while actively-managed equity funds saw outflows of SEK20bn. Since 2010, SEK85bn have been placed in index-based funds. Overall, funds on sale in Sweden have assets of SEK3,426trn, up by SEK240bn compared with the previous year.
