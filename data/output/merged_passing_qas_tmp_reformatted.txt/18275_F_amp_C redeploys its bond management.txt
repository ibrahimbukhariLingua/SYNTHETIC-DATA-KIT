F&amp;C redeploys its bond management


On its website, F&C Investments on 14 November published an article from Wealth Manager which claims that the reorganisation of its bond unit will result in the merger of high yield teams from F&C with credit teams from Thames River. This will result in the departures of fund manager Fatima Luis and three other members of the bond team. Han Altink, Mario Hooghiemstra and Leenders Schoenmaker. Fundweb states that F&C has confirmed the gist of the internal memo obtained by Wealth Manager. The British press is also reporting that Steve Drew, head of global credit at Thames River, has left the group, along with his colleauges Brett Golledge, and Peter Stage, head of credit research from F&C.
