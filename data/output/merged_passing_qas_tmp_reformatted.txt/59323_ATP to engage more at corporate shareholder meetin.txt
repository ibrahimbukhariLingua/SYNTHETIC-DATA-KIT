The Danish pension fund ATP, with assets under management totalling about SEK850bn, or about EUR113bn, has announced that it will now intent to engage more with companies to install good governance practices and to take social and environmental impact into account in their strategies, the news agency Reuters reports. “We want to be more active at general shareholders’ meetings, and to incite businesses to have good governance and to think of ESG (environmental, social and governance),” Christian Hyldahl, CEO of ATP, told Reuters, after releasing results on the morning of 30 August (see corresponding NewsManagers).The pension fund has not increased its exposure to equities, but has increased it with a higher level of shareholding, rather than favouring indirect exposure via derivative instruments. “When you have derivatives, you don’t have any active shareholding, you can’t vote, you only have financial exposure. We want to take the responsibility which is ours as large investors, and to be active at annual general shareholders’ meetings,” the CEO, who began at the start of this year, said.
