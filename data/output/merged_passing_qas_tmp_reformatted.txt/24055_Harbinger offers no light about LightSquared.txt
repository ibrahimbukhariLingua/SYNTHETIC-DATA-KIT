Harbinger offers no light about LightSquared


On Friday, in a very long telephone conference, Philip Falcone provided investors with no details about how he plans to deal with the failure of LightShared, the Wall Street Journal reports. Funds from Harbinger Capital Partners, the firm led by Falcone, invested billions of dollars in the creation of a new network by LightSquared, but the federal authorities in the US Tuesday forbid the project because of potential interference with GPS systems.
