Korean sovereign fund wants to move into alternative management


The Korean sovereign fund Korea Investment Corporation (KIC), which manages about USd30bn in assets, is planning to extend its investments into alternative management, Asian Investor reports. The Korean minister of Finance and Strategy, who has already contributed USD13bn to the fund, may this year make a further commitment of USD5bn. The new assets in the fund would be invested in alternative asset classes, including private equity, real estate, hedge funds, and commodities. The largest allocations would be for private equity. Exposure to alternative management could eventually be in the range of 15% to 20%.
