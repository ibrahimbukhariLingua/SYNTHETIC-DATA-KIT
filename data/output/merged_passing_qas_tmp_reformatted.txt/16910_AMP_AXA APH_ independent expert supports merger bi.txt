AMP/AXA APH: independent expert supports merger bid


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The agreement between the French insurer Axa and the Australian group AMP to share Axa Asia Pacific Holdings (Axa APH) is “fair and reasonable,” an independent expert found on 17 January, marking a new step towards the conclusion of the operation, slated for March. “The added value for minority shareholders in Axa APH from the offer is convincing,” and “in the absence of a higher offer, the offer is fair and reasonable and in the best interests of minority shareholders,” according to the conclusions of the respor, prepared by the independent expert Grant Samual, cited in a statement. Shareholders in Axa APH, including minority shareholders who have a sufficient minority to block motions, will meet on 2 March to vote on the bid.
