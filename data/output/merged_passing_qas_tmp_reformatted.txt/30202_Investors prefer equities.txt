Investors prefer equities


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } International investors are planning to invest more in 2013, particularly in equities, Money Marketing reports. According to the most recent Schroders Global Investment Trend Report survey, 37% of participants would like to increase their investments. The average investor may increase investments by 4%, with a preference for equities. Equities are the preferred asset class of 56% of respondents, due to their stronger potential for growth, compared with only 16% for bonds. However, the survey detects a “fundamental disconnection” between assets in which investors see the best potential for asset growth, and assets in which they are planning to invest. 75% of British investors put the Asia-Pacific region at the centre of investment growth in 2013, while only 15% hope to invest in the region. UK investors are also very cautious about investment in emerging markets, which they consider essential to improve the performance potential of their investments.
