Axiom AI diversifies fund range with new launch


The asset management firm Axiom Alternative Investments, based in Paris and London, with €1.2bn in assets under management, on 21 February announced the launch of a new fund, Axiom Credit Opportunity. The strategy aims for net annual returns of 12%, and a Sharpe ratio over 2. The non-directional fund will invest in credit derivatives, a market which is worth $8.4trn, according to statistics from the Bank for International Settlements. “Diversifying our existing fund range with Axiom Credit Opportunity allows us to add to the spectrum of non-directional investment solutions, which have limited correlation to traditional asset classes. Additionally, it is an opportunity to catch up with our base of historic investors seeking double-digit returns,” David Benamou, managing partner at Axiom AI, explains in a statement. The strategy will be focused on two sources of opportunity: capturing the value in structural price anomalies in the credit derivative market, and capturing opportunities arising from current regulations, which require banks to sell off risk to improve their returns on owners’ equity. Axiom Credit Opportunity aims to generate stable returns which are uncorrelated to traditional asset classes. The fund will focus on investment grade and high yield credit markets in Europe and North America. The strategy aims to maintain a neutral profile on the market, while integrating hedging to resist extreme market scenarios. Axiom Credit Opportunity is managed by Laurent Henrio, former global head of credit trading at Société Générale, who joined Axiom in September 2018. With 16 years of experience in credit derivative structuring and pricing at JP Morgan and then Société Générale, Henrio is considered one of the best credit derivative experts in Europe. He will be assisted by Adrian Paturle, a portfolio manager at Axiom since its inception, who has over 20 years of experience in managing credit funds.
