Syz AM opens an office in Madrid


The Swiss asset management firm Syz Asset Management (Syz AM) has announced the opening of an office in Madrid, Spain. The arm is entitled Syz Asset Management (Europe) Ltd, Sucursal en España, and will offer a wide range of sub-funds of the Luxembourg-registered Oyster Sicav, and discretionary mandates aimed at professional clients in Spain. “After the opening of offices in Munich and Milan in 2016, and a series of strategic recruitments and launches of special products, Syz AM confirms its commitment and its growing success in Europe,” the institutional management specialist says in a statement. The management of the new entity is entrusted to Luis Beltrami Cruz, who becomes head of the office as Branch Manager. Cruz, who has 11 years of experience in the sector, joined the Syz group in April 2014 as director of institutional sales. In this role, he actively promoted the Oyster range in Spain. “Assets under management in Spain have increased sharply recently and the trend appears to be continuing,” Syz AM states. “This pool is growing strongly and demand from investors is one of the strategic reasons that Syz AM is working to extend its range of products and services in this area.”
