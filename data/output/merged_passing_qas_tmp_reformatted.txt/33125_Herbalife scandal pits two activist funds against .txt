Herbalife scandal pits two activist funds against each other


The Herbalife company, which has been accused by William Ackman of Pershing Square of being a giant pyramid scheme, has received the powerful support of another activist funds with USD10bn in assets, Third Point by Dan Loeb, Les Echos reports. In a letter to investors dated 9 January, which Les Echos has obtained, Loeb gives a 3-page justificatino for his investment in 8.2% of capital in the business, purchased when the stock price fell 40% in four days in late December. Loeb finds the presentation by his colleague “long” but “lacking anything new,” and claims that it provided “no proof that the group has crossed a line which would lead regulators to close down the firm.” Herbalife should thus be able to respond to its detractor and to convince Wall Street. Third Point claims that shares in the firm are worth USD55 to USD68 each, compared with slightly over USD40 at the start of trading yesterday.
