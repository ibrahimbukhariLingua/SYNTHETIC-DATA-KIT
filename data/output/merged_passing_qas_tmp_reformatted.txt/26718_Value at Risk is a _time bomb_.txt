Value at Risk is a “time bomb”


The widespread use of “value at risk” to measure the risk exposure of funds is a “time bomb” which could provoke a serious crash on the markets, according to Jeremy Monk, chief investment officer at Akro Investicni Spolecnost in Prague, cited by Financial Times fund management. He estimates that in the case of a fall on the equity markets and a rise in volatility, fund managers would have to sell equities, which would exacerbate the fall.
