Alexandre Hezez leaves Convictions AM


Alexandre Hezez is leaving Convictions AM. The chief investment officer has decided to take on an entrepreneurial project, and if he desires, he may rely on the support of Cloran Finance, the largest shareholder (70% of capital) in the asset management firm led by Philippe Delienne, a statement released on the evening of Monday, 23 September states. In an interview with Newsmanagers, the management team at the firm insisted that the departure of the head of investments was not related to a disagreement. According to information obtained by Newsmanagers, Hezez had for several months been discussing his desire to enter an activity that combined advising, communications, analysis and management, particuarly in the area of international equities. Without the two events being related, it has been announced that at Convictions AM, Philippe Delienne will take over as head of investments. The firm underscores what it claims is an error committed in 2011: in order to award “UCITS IV” status to its funds and to allow it to retain institutional investors among its clients, Convictions AM agreed to opt for direct management of securities, and abandoned use of a fund of funds structure. The asset management firm is now going back to basics, and once it receives the appropriate licenses from the French Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) in the next few weeks, is preparing to add funds to its range, Convictions Premium and Convictions Europe Active, a mixed fund. The portfolios of these products may be invested directly in securities and also allow for the presence of underlying funds equivalent to more than 10% of total assets. As of the end of May, assets at Convictions AM totalled about EUR600m, of which nearly 85% are in the Convictions Premium fund. As of the beginning of September, assets under management total only EUR460m, of which EUR432m are in the flagship fund.
