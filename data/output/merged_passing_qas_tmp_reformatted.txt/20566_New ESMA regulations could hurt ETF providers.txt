New ESMA regulations could hurt ETF providers


Guidelines published by the European Securities & Markets Association (Esma) for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could hurt profitability for the sponsors of such products in Europe, according to Moody’s Investors Services.“The guidelines are credit negative for asset managers that sponsor ETFs in Europe, such as BlackRock, Inc. (A1 stable) and State Street Corporation (A1 stable), and will hurt profitability as a result of higher compliance costs and curtailment of their profitable securities lending activities”, writes the rating agency.Under the new guidelines, all securities lending revenues, net of operating costs, must be returned to the ETF to compensate investors for assuming the associated counterparty risk. ETF sponsors have a wide range of practices regarding securities lending revenue sharing. While some ETF sponsors, such as Comstage, Credit Suisse Asset Management, ETFLab or XACT, already return 100% of securities lending fee income to fund investors, others retain a percentage of the fee income for themselves. Some sponsors, such as EasyETF and SPDR ETF, keep up to 50% of the revenue, notes Moody’s. The ESMA guidelines also improve ETF disclosure. Initially, asset managers will incur operational costs related to the redesign of prospectuses, key investor information documents and marketing materials of their existing UCITS ETFs to reflect the new disclosure requirements. They will also have to ensure that the collateral used in their ETFs’ securities lending transactions complies with strict qualitative criteria and specific limits in relation to diversification, which implies additional costs in terms of new reporting and monitoring requirements.
