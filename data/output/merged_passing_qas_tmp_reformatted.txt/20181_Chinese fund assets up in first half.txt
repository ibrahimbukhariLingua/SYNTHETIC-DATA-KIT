Chinese fund assets up in first half


The 13 Chinese fund management firms which on 24 August had released their results for first half, have experienced an increase by CNY18.5bn in their 184 products, where assets under management had fallen by CNY26.1bn in the corresponding period of last year, before falling by a further CNY88.6bn in second half.Z-Ben Advisors reports that this rapid bounce back is partly due to good performance on bond markets, and partly to the performance of small and midcaps. However, the CSI 300 index shows losses since July, and the CSI Aggregate Bond Index has also turned down.
