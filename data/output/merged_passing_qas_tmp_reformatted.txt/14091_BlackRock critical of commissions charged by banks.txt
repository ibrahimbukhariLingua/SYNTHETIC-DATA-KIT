BlackRock critical of commissions charged by banks on IPOs


The Financial Times reports that the BlackRock group, the largest investor on British stock markets, last week sent a letter to the major investment banks to denounce their “increasingly aggressive” approach to commissions on initial public offerings. BlackRock says that commissions are structured in such a way as to maximise revenues on the first day of trading, without regard to the long-term success of the offering.
