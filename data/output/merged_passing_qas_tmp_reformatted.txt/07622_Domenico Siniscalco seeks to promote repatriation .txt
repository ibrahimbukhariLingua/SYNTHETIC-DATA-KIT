Domenico Siniscalco seeks to promote repatriation of Italian management firms


In an interview with Il Sole – 24 Ore, Domenico Siniscalco, vice president of Morgan Stanley International and country head for Italy at the firm, who has also recently become president of Assogestioni, the Italian association of management professionals, claims that the competitiveness of the Italian asset management sector needs to be promoted. The former Italian minister of the economy says that the UCITS IV legislation may cause large-scale movements in the industry, “with the paradox that Italian savings would be managed abroad, and would be taxed abroad.” Italy, which is a country of savers, “may become a net importer of financial products made elsewhere,” he adds. Siniscalco therefore calls for a reform of the tax structures applicable to Italian funds, which are currently at a disadvantage compared with those of other countries. He also calls for an initiative to support the repatriation of asset management firms based in other countries. “It would be desirable for management firms which decide to return to Italy to be able to continue to earn profits for a certain period of time on profits which they make in the countries to which they have moved.”
