Allfunds prepares for “all-out expansion”


Allfunds Bank (Santander and Intesa Sanpaolo) has now returned to its 2007 record asset levels of EUR45bn, thanks to international clients, who represent two thirds of this total. In the next three years, Expansión reports, Allfunds is planning to move into Asia, with a branch in Hong Kong, and to open new offices in Latin America, in Mexico and Brazil. The firm is already present in Chile and Colombia, and is planning to make its debut in Peru. It is also planning to create a unit for Central Europe (Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Scandinavia). In addition, the firm is hoping to become the point of reference for fund distribution in the Middle East, as it is the only European firm with a sales license for Sharia-compliant funds. Allfunds is seeking a new shareholder to realise this ambitious development plan. It should not be a local leader like Intesa, but a major international actor. Allfunds Bank is planning to increase its presence in the United Kingdom, which represents 11% of its assets. To achieve this, it has recruited Alan Gadd (formerly of Henderson and Aviva) as head, and is planning to double the size of its local team to 30.
