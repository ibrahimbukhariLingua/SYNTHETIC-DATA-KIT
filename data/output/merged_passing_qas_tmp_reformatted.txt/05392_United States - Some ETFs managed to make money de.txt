United States - Some ETFs managed to make money despite conditions in 2008


As a general rule, ETFs lost money last year, since they replicate the evolution of the markets. However, in the equities ETF fund class, the ProShares UltraShort S&P 500, which uses short positions and leverage, posted performance of 61%, the Wall Street Journal reports. In bond funds, the iShares Lehman 20+ Year Treasury Bond Fund and the SPDR Lehman Long Term Treasury ETF gained 34% and 24%, respectively, according to Morningstar.
