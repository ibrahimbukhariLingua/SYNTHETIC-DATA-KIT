VP Bank, losing momentum, restructures


VP Bank has announced group-wide profits for first half of CHF16.1m, down 40% from first half 2009. Profits to be paid out to shareholders are down to CHF14.5m, compared with CHF25m previously. The Liechtenstein business has reported net outflows in first half of CHF300m, compared with CHF1bn one year earlier, meaning that the negative trend observed last year has not quite reversed itself, even though in international wealth management activities, the bank posted net inflows of CHF100m. Assets under management totalled CHF28.4bn as of 30 June, compared with CHF29.5bn as of 31 December 2009. In this difficult context, the bank has already responded with a cost reduction program. But due to the “profound” reversals on the market, the bank has decided to take on a new, lighter structure. From 1 September 2010, Group Executive Management will include only three members, down from five previously: Roger Hartmann, CEO, as chairman; Fredy Vogt, CFO, as head of the Corporate Center, and Jürg Sturzenegger as head of service units in the new Wealth Management Solutions & Services unit. Ernst Näf and Gerhard Häring, who were members of the executive board, will be leaving the VP Bank group. The firm is also planning to launch growth initiatives throughout the group. The heads are planning to extend the client base in key markets (in addition to Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Germany), and in emerging markets. The teams of advisors in Singapore and Zurich will be added to as planned, and will focus largely on Asia and central and eastern Europe. Expertise in international tax law will also be developed.
