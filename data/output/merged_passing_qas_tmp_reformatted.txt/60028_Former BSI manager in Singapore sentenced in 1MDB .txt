Former BSI manager in Singapore sentenced in 1MDB affair


A former wealth manager from the Swiss bank BSI in Sinngaporem was on 12 July sentenced to four and a half years in prison, in a further sentencing related to the political and financial 1MDB scandal in Malaysia, AFP reports. The Singapore citizen Yeo Jiawei was found guilty of money-laundering and fraud. The sentence was combined with a previous 30-month sentence, which he was handed in December last year by a South-East Asian appeals court for obstruction of justice and suborning witnesses.The corruption scandal involves hundreds of millions of euros from the sovereign fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), and is also under investigation in Switzerland and the United States. The former wealth manager made “considerable effort” to dissimulate the delinquent acts, and exploited his professional position for personal gain, Ong Hian, presiding in the trial, said. The court “must take an uncompromising position” with respect to these crimes, in order to protect the integrity of the financial system in Singapore, he added. The sovereign fund 1MDB was created by the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, when he came to power in 2009, to modernise the country. 1MDB now has EUR10bn in debt.
