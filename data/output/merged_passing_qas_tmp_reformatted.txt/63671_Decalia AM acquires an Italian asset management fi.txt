Decalia AM acquires an Italian asset management firm


The Geneva-based asset management firm Decalia Asset Management, founded by former employees of Syz Asset Management, has acquired Astor Investment Advisors SIM SpA, a Milan-based firm active in institutional management. The sale price remains confidential.The acquisition will not only allow Decalia AM to gain a foothold in Italy, which is one of its “priority key markets,” but will also open the door to other locations in Europe, through the European passport. In addition to its base activities, Astor will now also concentrate on private wealth management and distribution of Decalia funds.Following the operation, Astor Investment Advisors SIM becomes Decalia Asset Management SIM SpA. The Italian firm, founded in Milan in 2008 by Francesco Marini Clarelli and Jody Vender, specialises in thematic management. The approach concentrates on a few promising themes, and is implemented as a hedge fund and an Italian-regsitered UCITS fund. The boutique now has six employees, but several recruitments are planned in the near future to continue development plans following the acquisition, which will quickly bring personnel up to 10 people.“Italy is a major market in Europe, and represents one of our key priorities. We had planned to set up there since the start, and through this acquisition, it has now been accomplished in the best manner possible. Francesco Marini Clarelli and Jody Vender are both major personalities in the Italian finance industry,” says Alfredo Piacentini, partner and CEO at Decalia.Decalia AM, which had EUR1.8bn in assets under management as of October 2016, also hopes to develop in France, as Xavier Guillon, one of the partners at the asset management firm, has told Newsmangers.
