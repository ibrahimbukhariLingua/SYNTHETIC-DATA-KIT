Deutsche Bank to rationalise its AM operation in Germany


The Handelsblatt recalls that Deutsche Bank has decided to examine all strategic options as to the future of its asset management operations, but that DWS will in any case remain a core part of its business. Yet DWS has lost of its luster, and doesn’t rank anymore in the Top 3 in Feri’s tables of the AMCs with the highest proportion of top-rated funds.And Deutsche Bank will have to rationalise the operation under Anju Jain,the new co-head of the management board: Deutsche Bank manages money at Oppenheimer, at Frankfurt Trust, at its wealth management operation, at its derivatives affiliate X-markets and at db X-trackers (ETFs). But, as of yet, DWS contributes for the full amount to the EUR300m in profits of the AM operations.
