Ardian acquires Europe 1 headquarters in Paris


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } The investment company Ardian on 8 March announced that it has signed two agreements to acquire two properties in Paris. These represent the second and third acquisitions made by Ardian Real Estate in France. The sale price has not been disclosed. The first transaction concerns an office property located at 2, place Rio-de-Janeiro, in the 8th district of Paris, near Monceau park. “This real estate complex will undergo a complete restructuring operation to position the property with ‘premium’ standards,” Ardian says in a statement. The second transaction is to acquire the Europe 1 property, the historic headquarters of the radio station since its creation in 1955, located at 26-32, rue François 1er, in the 8th district of Paris. “This property will undergo very significant restructuring, particularly to optimise the office spaces to ‘premium’ standards, and to create new, high-quality commercial spaces,” Ardian says. The acquisition is the second to be made from the Lagardère group, following the Europa building in Levallois-Perret in June 2017.
