Germany - Bankhaus Lampe gains ground


In an interview with the Börsen-Zeitung, Stephan Schüller, chairman of the managing board at Bankhaus Lampe, declines to state exactly how much was written off on a 6.06% stake in Aareal Bank, but indicates that the amount is between EUR30m and EUR60m. The private bank has no intention of reconsidering its investment. The banker says the number of high net worth clients on its books has increased by more than 10%, even though assets have been unable to maintain the same pace due to the evolution of the markets. Lampe is also preparing a spin-off of its family office.
