Bank of England attacks bonuses


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Bank of England on 13 March published a consultation document which lays out new proposals to force banks to sanction their bankers for indiscretions. The central bank is proposing that bankers should if necessary block and claw back bonuses awarded up to six years after their payment. With this in mind, the Bank of England is proposing to introduce terms to this effect into labour contracts. The central bank calls on bans not to put pay programmes in place which encourage bankers to take unconsidered risks which could endanger the stability of the financial system, as has recently occurred with the mis-selling and Libor scandals. The consultation will remain open for two months, and the new measures will be announced after consultation makes it possible for them to come into effect on 1 January 2015.
