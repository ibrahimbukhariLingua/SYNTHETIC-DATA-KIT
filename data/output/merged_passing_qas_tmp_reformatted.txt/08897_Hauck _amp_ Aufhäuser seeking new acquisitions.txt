Hauck &amp; Aufhäuser seeking new acquisitions


After creating an investment banking activity through its acquisition of a stake in Cazenove AG last year, the private bank Hauck & Aufhäuser (H&A) is now seeking further acquisitions in 2010. Michael Schramm, managing partner, says in an interview with the Börsen-Zeitung that external growth may involve businesses in the German-speaking countries in the areas of private banking, fund administration, or institutional asset management. Volker van Rüth, the other managing partner, says that H&A has repositioned its institutional management, and extended its range to also include guaranteed products. Distribution has also been scaled up.
