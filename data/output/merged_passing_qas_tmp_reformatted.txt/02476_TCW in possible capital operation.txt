TCW in possible capital operation


The US asset management arm of Société Générale, TCW, which manages about USD105bn in assets, may be involved in a recapitalisation or an MBO in partnership with a private equity fund. The New York Post reports on 1 September that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is among the private equity funds that may participate in an operation of this type. In an interview with the New York Post, the interim CEO of TCW, Mark Stern, says that private equity may be involved in a recapitalisation operation at the affiliate, but denies that Société Générale is planning to sell the firm. Société Générale acquired a majority stake in TCW in 2001, and has gradually increased its stake to 70%. The French bank, which did not comment the article, confirmed yesterday that at a time when its management activities are being merged with those of Crédit Agricole, it would like to spin off TCW with an IPO in the next five years. After the merger of its management activities with those of Crédit Agricole, the firm expects to hold a 20% stake in TCW.
