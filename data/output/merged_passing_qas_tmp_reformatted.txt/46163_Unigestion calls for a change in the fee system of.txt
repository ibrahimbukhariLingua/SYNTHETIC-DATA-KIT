Unigestion calls for a change in the fee system of hedge funds


Unigestion claims that the total fees charged to investors by hedge funds should not exceed 20% to 25% of gross returns, and should reward profesionals better. To achieve that, it is necessary to change the remuneration mode of hedge funds, the Swiss asset management firm, which has over EUR1.6bn in assets under management in hedge funds, argues in a document which willl be published in a few weeks.Currently, hedge fund managers are paid on the basis of asset management fees and performance fees. Asset management fees are charged regardless of the returns earned, while performance fees reward managers according to the returns earned. But the facts show that the current system appears to privilege hedge fund managers who perform least well.Unigestion has ranked hedge funds into four quartiles, according to their performance (between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2014). It finds that the ones in the top quartile, who earn average returns of 12.4%, win 20.6% of gross returns, while funds in the third quartile, which earn net gains of only 1.7%, pocket 38.6% of the gross returns.Ideally, to solve this anomaly, hedge fund managers should charge only performance fees, Unigestion claims. That would allow for the interets of the manager to be totally aligned with those of investors. But the asset mangement firm is aware that it is difficult for hedge fund managers to suppress management fees, which allow them to retain talent.Unigestion therefore proposes introducing a hurdle rate for performance fees. The level of the hurdle rate above which the manager wouuld be permitted to begin charging performance fees would depend on the level of the management fees. The higher these are, the higher the hurdle rate would be. This would make it possible to help investors to return to this sector, which has recently been accused of charging excessive fees for mediocre performance.
