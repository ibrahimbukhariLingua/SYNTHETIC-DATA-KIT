Mid-sized hedge funds also affected by SEC registration requirement


Mandatory registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for all hedge funds with assets of over USD150m may apply to a larger number of hedge funds than expected. According to the Wall Street Journal, mid-sized hedge funds may also be affected by the clause in the Dodd-Frank law.The cause for the extension of the perimeter of application of the law is the definition of assets, which are not limited to net inflows. According to the SEC, the USD150m threshold applies to gross assets, which also include the leverage used by the firm. In other words, a hedge fund which declares net assets of USD75m would be required to register by the end of March 2012, when the Dodd-Franck law comes into effect, if it uses leverage of two.
