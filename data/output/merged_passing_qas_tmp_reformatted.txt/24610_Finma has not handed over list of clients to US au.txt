Finma has not handed over list of clients to US authorities


General Counsel Urs Zulauf has rejected the claim that the Swiss financial market surveillance authority (Finma) has handed over information about former clients or employees of UBS to US authorities. At the end of February 2009, information on 255 clients of UBS were handed to the US Department of Justice, “and that’s all,” says Zulauf in an interview with Finanz und Wirtschaft.Most recently, the Federal court found that the transaction was legal. Zulauf claims that the US authorities received data on clients as part of their own tax amnesty programme. He says that one may estimate that 10,000 Swiss banking clients have taken advantage of the programme. In addition to that, information on 4,450 cases were handed over as part of the agreement in the UBS scandal.
