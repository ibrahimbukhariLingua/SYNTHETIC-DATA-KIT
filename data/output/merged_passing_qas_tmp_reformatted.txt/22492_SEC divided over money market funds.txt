SEC divided over money market funds


Members of the SEC are highly divided on plans by chairwoman Mary Shapiro for money market funds, the Wall Street Journal reports. Asset management firms claim that the proposals, which would limit the ability of investors to sell funds quickly and would change the way in which the prices of funds are determined, would threaten the long-term survival of the sector. In a drive to win the battle, directors of Fidelity, JP Morgan Chase, Vanguard and Federated Investors spent 10 hours one day in March meeting 15 members of Congress from both parties.
