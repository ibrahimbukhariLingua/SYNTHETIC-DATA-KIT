P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Rating agency Standard & Poor’s has placed Swiss banks at the top of its rankings for risk, particularly with regard to the stability of its deposits, according to a statement released on 17 May.The Swiss banking sector has been ranked in group 1 of its Banking Industry Country Risk Assessment (BICRA) rankings, which evaluate the risks for the sector by country, the agency says in a statement.Currently, Switzerland is the only country in this category. The closest partners of Switzerland, including France and Germany, are ranked as BICRA 2, the same sa Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, Liechtenstein, Finland, and Australia.The rating agency explains that the decision is related to the high levels of deposits and a contained appetite for risk, in addition to a minimal dependence on external financing and the support which the national debt market provides.Standard & Poor’s has also cited the flexibility and competitiveness of the Swiss economy and the solidity of public finances. It has, however, issued a warning over the real estate market, which may pose credit risks in the future, despite a conservative culture of risk and lending.
