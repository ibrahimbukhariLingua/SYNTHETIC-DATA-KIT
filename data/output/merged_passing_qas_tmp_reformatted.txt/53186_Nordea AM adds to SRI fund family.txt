This new solution comes as an addition to its family of STARS funds. The Nordea 1 – Global Stars Equity fund, investing in equities in international companies, is managed agnostically with resepct to all benchmarks. The management team implements a distinctive approach, combining bottom-up, fundamental stock-picking with in-depth environment, social and governance (ESG) analysis. Nordea AM notes that the STARS concept developed by Nordea is based on one conviction: businesses which are able to generate consistent returns over time, while respecting ESG practices and benefiting from attractive valuation, create value for shareholders. The objective for the team is to proactively seelcft businesses with the best ESG scores, rather than systematically excluding sectors which are traditionally less well-ranked in this area. The fund, managed by Johan Swahn and Daniel Ovin from Nordea Asset Management, benefits from the expertise of the entire socially responsible investment team, composed of 14 people. The fund joins the STARS fund family, which already includes the Nordea 1 – Emerging Stars Equity and Nordea 1 – Nordic Stars Equity funds.
