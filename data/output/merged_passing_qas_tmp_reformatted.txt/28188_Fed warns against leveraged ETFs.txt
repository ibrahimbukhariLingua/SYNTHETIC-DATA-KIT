Fed warns against leveraged ETFs


Leveraged ETF trading in times of high volatility could trigger a crash of US equity markets, the Federal Reserve has warned, according to the Financial Times. “Rebalancing by leveraged ETFs in response to a large market move could amplify the move and force them to further rebalance, which may trigger a ‘cascade’ reaction,” says Tugkan Tuzun, an economist at the Fed.
