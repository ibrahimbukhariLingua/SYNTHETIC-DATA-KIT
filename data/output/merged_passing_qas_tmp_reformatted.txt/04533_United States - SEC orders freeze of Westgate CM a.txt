United States - SEC orders freeze of Westgate CM assets


The SEC has instructed the US department of justice to freeze all assets of Westgate Capital Mangement and its director, James M. Nicholson, due to suspected fraud, Hedge Week reports. Nicholson is accused of having deceived investors with unlikely reports of the performance of his eleven hedge funds. A criminal investigation of Nicholson has been launched by the New York state prosecutorâ€™s office. Nicholson was barred in 2001 from practicing as a broker, for giving misleading testimony to an investigation by the NASD, which has since become Finra.
