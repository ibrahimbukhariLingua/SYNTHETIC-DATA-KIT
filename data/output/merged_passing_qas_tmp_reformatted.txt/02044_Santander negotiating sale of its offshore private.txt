Santander negotiating sale of its offshore private bank to Credit Suisse


Its efforts to sell Santander Asset Management having ended in failure, Santander is now negotiating a sale of its offshore private banking affiliate which manages about EUR100bn in Geneva, Miami and the Bahamas, mostly for Latin American clients, Cotizalia reports. Potential buyers are said to include Credit Suisse, represented at the negotiations by Walter Berchtold, the head of wealth management. Negotiations on the Santander side are Rodrigo Echenique, who is director of the bank and who has the confidence of Emilio Botín, and Javier Marín, CEO of the private banking division. Taking the multiple ratios in use before the crisis as a guide, for example, those used at the acquisitions of Urquijo or the Morgan Stanley private bank, the deal could be worth EUR6-8bn.
