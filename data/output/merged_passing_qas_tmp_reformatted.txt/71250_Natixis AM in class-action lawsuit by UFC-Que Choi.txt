Natixis AM in class-action lawsuit by UFC-Que Choisir


The legal troubles at Natixis Asset Management (Natixis AM) are not improving. As the asset management firm yesterday morning revealed a new brand identity (Ostrum AM read the story elsewhere today on NewsManagers), UFC-Que Choisir chose the same day to draw the attention of the press to the regulatory issues at Natixis AM, and to announce that it has initiated a class-action lawsuit. As the record fine levelled against the firm by the sanctions commission of the French regulator, the Commission des Sanctions de l’Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), has been extended against Natixis AM as a result of shortfalls in the management of 133 formula funds, and in the absence of a satisfactory response from Natixis AM to its cooperative approach, the UFC-Que Choisir association has announced that it is engaging a class action before the high court in Paris to reimburse consumers who subscribed to one or more of these funds via the Banques Populaires or the Caisse d’Epargne. “Although the verdict of the AMF in July 2017 had strong sanctions for the hidden fees scandal at Natixis which UFC-Que Choisir denounced repeatedly, the association still wishes for the victims of this practice to be indemnified,” the association says in a statement. The association admits that “the individual damages vary strongly depending on the fund concerned and the investment made, and for funds which generate excess management fees, may be as much as several hundreds of euros per consumer.”“In the interests of obtaining indemnity for the victims, and for them to retain their documentary evidence during the procedure,” UFC-Que Choisir is making a frequently-asked questions document available on its website, where consumers can learn more about the action, and to verify that they are potentially affected, and a form, by which they may make themselves known to the association if required.Natixis AM contests the verdict of the AMF, which is currently under appeal to the French Conseil d’Etat.
