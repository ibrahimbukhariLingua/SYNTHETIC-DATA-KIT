Phitrust Active Investors launches a social business Sicav


Phitrust Active Investors, a specialist in shareholder engagement, will be launching a Sicav in the next few months which encourages the development of social business strategies at major European businesses belonging to the Eurostoxx 50. Social business, also known as “bottom of the pyramid” strategy, is an activity which aims to improve a social or ecological issue. The most emblematic example is probably the case of Danone, which in Bangladesh is producing a low-price, vitamin-enriched yoghurt for children with dietary deficiencies. “To be a genuine social business, these activities need to design custom products for local markets, dedicated to disadvantaged clients at a low price. The question of whether the activities should be profitable is an open one, but in my opinion it is preferable to ensure the survival of the activity,” explains Luis Sanchez de Lozada, legal head of Phitrust. Of the businesses of the Euroztoxx 50, ten firms are seriously engaged in this type of activity, Sanchez de Lozada estimates. In the new Sicav, companies will be given an overweight position compared with their weight in the index, once they are identified. The Social Business Active Investors fund is a “tilted” index-based Sicav, like its elder sibling Proxy Active Investors. In other words, the portfolio is invested in all the shares of the index, and businesses are overweight or underweight depending on their activities in the area of social business. The Sicav will be launched once Phitrust Active Investors has collected EUR20m from institutional investors.
