Schroders renames a series of Cazenove funds


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Schroders is planning to rename its range of Cazenove Capital multi-manager funds, and to merge the two series of multi-manager funds which it currently offers, several British specialist sites report. From 24 March 2014, the seven funds of the Cazenove range will be offered as Schroders MM funds. For example, the flagship fund Cazenove Multi-Manager Diversity fund will become the Schroder MM Diversity fund. In the wake of this name change, Schroders will merge a number of portfolios during second quarter 2014, in order to reduce the number of available strategies from ten to six. The Cazenove Managed Portfolio fund, which has been renamed as Schroder MM Managed Portfolio, will be merged with the Schroder MM diversity Balanced, which has now been renamed as the Cazenove Multi-Manager Diverity Balanced fund.
