LGIM offers pension funds an active/passive synchronisation solution


Like Schroders, Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) now has its own “Matching Plus” platform. The solution is “transparent, flexible and easy to deploy” to optimise liability-driven investments (LDI) for pension funds, the management firm says.Matching Plus allows investors to select products from a complete range of liability-driven funds, in order to reduce exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and/or inflation, in combination with funds which aim to generate positive returns. This allows a way to establish custom management for each pension fund.The platform also provides investors with the flexibility to change investment strategies as their financial situation changes. It is also designed in such a way as to minimise the subsequent impact of changes in regulations and market configurations.
