Lyxor announces datathon on ESG and financial performance


A datathon on the subject of positive finance organised by Lyxor is now underway. From 3 to 5 April, experts will seek to better understand the relationships between ESG criteria and financial performance at companies. The objective for participants is to identify the “factors that encourage savings orientation toward sustainable finance,” Lyxor says in a statement. To achieve this, participants in the datathon will use financial data provided by Lyxor, and extra-financial data provided by MSCI. The tadathon unites participants at Lyxor and Société Générale (managers, sales personnel, SRI experts, data scientists, marketing specialists) and startups (such as Jalgos and Alphien), the DataLab at the Institut Louis Bachelier, and tech experts at Liberté Living-Lab, a Lyxor partner. Data processing will be complemented by a review of the scientific literature produced in partnership with the Institut Louis Bachelier, covering academic quantitative and qualitative analyses of ESG themes privileged by investors and savers.
