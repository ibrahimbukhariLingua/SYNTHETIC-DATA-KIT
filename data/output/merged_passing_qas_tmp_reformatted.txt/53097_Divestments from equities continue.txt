Divestments from equities continue


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } There is little change in sight in terms of asset flows. Investors are continuing to reduce their exposure to equities while increasing purchases of so-called risk-free bonds in a context of a US interest rate hike coming sooner than expected. Funds investing in equities finished the week to 25 May with net outflows of USD9.2bn, for their seventh consecutive week of net outflows, according to a weekly study by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, based on statistics released by the global flow monitoring specialist agency EPFR Global. Since the beginning of this year, funds investing in equities have seen net outflows totalling USD105bn. European equity funds in the past week have seen net outflows of USD3.3bn, for a 16th consecutive week of outflows. US equity funds have seen net redemptions totalling USD1.1bn, while funds dedicated to Japanese equities completed the week with net outflows of USD0.9bn. Equity funds still show losses but totalling only USD0.2bn. On the side of bonds, total inflows in the week came to USD2.6bn, with net inflows of USD2.5bn to funds specialised in investment grade bonds, while there were net redemptions of USD2.1bn from high yield bonds funds, and also redemptions of USD0.3bn from emerging market debt funds.
