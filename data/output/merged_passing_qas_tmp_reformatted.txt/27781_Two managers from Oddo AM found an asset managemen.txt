Two managers from Oddo AM found an asset management firm


Muriel Blanchier and Xavier Hoche are setting out on their own. The two managers on 14 August left Oddo Asset Management to found their own asset management firm. The new firm will be known as AltaRocca Asset Management, and will be a subsidiary of the Primonial group, within its multi-boutique structure. The group will hold a majority 70% stake in the capital of AltaRocca Asset Management, on the same model as its partnership with Roche-Brune AM, another structure in the Primonial galaxy. At AltaRocca AM, Blanchier and Hoche will offer a range of funds on the themes of convertibles and returns, aimed at both institutitonal and retail investors. “The arrival of Muriel and Xavier confirms our ambition to develop our multi-boutique concept in asset management, to offer our clients real talent in asset management. As is the case with Roche-Brune Am and its President and Founder Bruno Fine, the AltaRocca AM company has real autonomy in management, and benefits from the distribution power of the Primonial group,” André Camo, chairman of the Primonial group, says. At Oddo AM, two new fund managers have been recruited to fill the open positions. Their names will be announced soon.
