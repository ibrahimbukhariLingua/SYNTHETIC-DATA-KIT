Invesco plans to scale up ETF activities in Europe


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Invesco Powershares wants in the short term become one of the top 10 ETF providers in terms of assets, but in the long term, it aspires to be a top tier provider, according to Bryon Lake, head of Powershares for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, in an interview with Ignites Europe. The group is currently only 17th in Europe, though it takes fourth place worldwide. With this in mind, the firm will launch a series of ETFs, the first of which is the PowerShares Global Buyback Achievers Ucits ETF. Five to ten products will be launched in the next three to four years. Target countries are the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria.
