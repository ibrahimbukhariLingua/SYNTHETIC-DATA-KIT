United States - Wealth management: rumours of a UBS/Wachovia merger


Handelsblatt relays reports in the New York Post that UBS is in negotiations with Wachovia to create a joint venture in wealth management, but the two firms have refused to comment. The operation would aim to stem the flow of clients leaving UBS in the United States.Meanwhile, the Swiss group is reportedly seeking to recruit wealth management advisors from Wall Street firms, offering them bonuses corresponding to 250% of their income. By comparison, Merrill Lynch paid bonuses of only 100% to win over employees in its acquisition of Bank of America.
