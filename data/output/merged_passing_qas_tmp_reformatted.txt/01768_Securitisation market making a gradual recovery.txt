Securitisation market making a gradual recovery


Les Echos reports that the British bank Nationwide is this week launching a securitisation operation for at least GBP3.5bn in real estate securitisations backed by residential mortgages (RMBS). The move follows securitisation issues from Lloyds Banking Group and Volkswagen. These deals do not mark a return to normal, as the Nationwide offer includes maximal guarantees to reinsure investors who continue to be cautious. The preliminary rating from Fitch gives the maximal rating (AAA) to the first two rounds of issues, while the selection of loans to be included in the securitisations means that Nationwide will retain 5% of the structured debts on its books, which is a gauge of the quality of the underlying assets.
