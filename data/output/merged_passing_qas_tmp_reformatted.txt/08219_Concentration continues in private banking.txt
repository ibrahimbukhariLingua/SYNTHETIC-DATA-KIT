Concentration continues in private banking


Following the acquisition of Sal. Oppenheim by Deutsche Bank, and the acquisition of Reuschel by Conrad Hinrich Donner, professionals are now predicting further mergers in the German private banking industry, to serve a wealth management market weighing in at about EUR1.2trn, Handelsblatt reports. Recently, Deutsche Bank launched a RFP for BHF-Bank, which is owned by Sal. Oppenheim. The German market also interests actors such as Julius BÃ¤r, Sarasin and Vontobel, and German savings and co-operative banks are also looking for a slice of the pie.
