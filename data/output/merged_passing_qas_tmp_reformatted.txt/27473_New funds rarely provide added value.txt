New funds rarely provide added value


According to the Berlin-based ratings agency Scope, newly-launched funds only rarely provide added value compared with older products. A comparison of German funds launched in the period from February to July 2012 with older supports finds, for example, that the 29 new funds in the global equity category showed average returns of 9.5% for one year, while products which were previously on sale earned 11.2% on average. The same applies to Europe funds, with 14.6% compared with 16.9% for older products. Only new US equity funds outperformed older producs, with 17.5% compared with 14.1%.The same observation applied to multi-asset class funds. Among the other categories (defensive, balanced, offensive and flexible), only balanced products did better than their older counterparts, with an average return of 6.4% compared with 3.7% for older funds.Scope has identified three reasons for this lack of performance of new funds. On the one hand, they are often not new concepts, but older ideas “repackaged.” On the other, the investment and selection process need to be consoldated and installed, even if the managers are experienced. Lastly, newly-launched funds often have lower asset levels, which means that fixed costs absorb a higher proportion of performance. In addition, new funds need to be promoted, which is also costly.
