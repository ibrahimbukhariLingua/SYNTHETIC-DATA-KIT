Barclays undertakes far-reaching restructuring of its credit portfolio


On Wednesday, Barclays PLC announced the sale to the Protium fund from the management firm C12 Capital Management of USD12.3bn in credits. The bank is lending USD12.6bn for 10 years (at a rate of the US Libor plus 275 basis points) to the new fund, specially created to acquire assets of this type, and which will receive USD250m from its managing partners, Stephen King (who previously was director of the principal mortgage trading group at Barclays Capital), and Michael Keeley (member of the management committee at Barclays Cap for European financial institutions). The loan is being issued against assets which have been transferred to Protium by Barclays, which financial sector observers suggest might be toxic assets inherited from Lehman Brothers. This theoretical cleansing of the credit portfolio involves USD8.2bn in structured credit insured by credit resellers and monoliners (USD3.6bn in guaranteed credit from resellers by fair value, and USD4.6bn from monoliners), USD2.3bn in RMBS and other ABS, and USD1.8bn in residential mortgage loans. Barclays states that due to regulatory considerations, the assets will continue to weigh on its balance sheet, meaning that the transaction will not reduce its need for regulatory capital requirements. The transaction will, however, limit the potential impact of short-term fluctuations in the value of assets or possible downgrades of the ratings of credit resellers.
