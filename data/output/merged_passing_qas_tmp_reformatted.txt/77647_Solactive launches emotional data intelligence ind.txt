Solactive launches emotional data intelligence index


Solactive has announcedthe development of yet another innovative index utilising alternative data sources. The next index deployed by the German index provider is labelled Solactive Europe Big Data Sentiment Index and features a unique approach of using emotional data. The proprietary algorithm mines user-generated information from Social Media platforms, delivering the primary dataset of this particular index. Social Media data is a valuable source of information. A study from British Stanford University found that, after analysing users’ behaviour on social media platforms, computers are superior to the users’ close family & friends in judging character traits. To harvest information on financial data, Solactive teamed up with Stockpulse GmbH (StockPulse), which is a pioneer in emotional data intelligence, specialised in the data mining of publicly available online sources predominantly concerned with discussions about financial markets. The index operates as the underlying for an open-ended index certificate by Swiss banking groupUBS, enabling sophisticated investors to participate in European stocks that exhibit a strongly positive score on overall communication in social media and newspapers.
