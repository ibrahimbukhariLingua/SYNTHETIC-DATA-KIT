American Century sizes up its Hong Kong office


Asian Investor reports that American Century Investments (USD80bn in assets) has recruited Mirando Poon, cive president for business development for Asia ex Japan at Pictet. She will report to Tony Archer, who recently joined ACI (see Newsmanagers of 2 May). The Asia-Pacific team is hierarchically beneath London, and relies technically (for back office and operation functions) on Kansas City.
