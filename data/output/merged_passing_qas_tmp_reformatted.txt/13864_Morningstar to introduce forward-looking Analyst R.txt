Morningstar to introduce forward-looking Analyst Rating for funds


Morningstar, Inc on June 9th announced its plans to introduce forward-looking, analyst-driven, qualitative, global fund ratings and a uniform approach for global fund research reports. The ratings and reports will be based on analysts’ convictions about a fund’s ability to outperform its peer group and/or relevant benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis over the long term. The «star» ratings, which are quantitative, remain in place, though.The company said it plans to launch the new ratings and research reports in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand in the fourth quarter.The new Morningstar Analyst Rating™ for funds will be assigned as one of five ratings—AAA, AA, A, Neutral, or Negative. Analysts arrive at a rating through an evaluation of five key pillars Morningstar believes are crucial to predicting the future success of a fund: People, Process, Parent, Performance, and Price.
