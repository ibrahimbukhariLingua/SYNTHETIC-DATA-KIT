“As they are, PRIIP regulations are a real nightmare” - Better Finance


Newsmanagers: You have had a strong presence in the past few weeks on the issue of closet indexing, which is a phenomenon by which funds claim to be active and charge exorbitant commissions, but which are actually managed as passive funds. Where are you with that?Guillaume Prache : We had asked the European securities markets authority (ESMA) to study the phenomenon of these actively-managed funds which are actually not very active. ESMA responded to our request by publishing a study in February 2016, but did not disclose the list of suspected funds identified in the study. So we carried on by replicating the ESMA study. We then approached the European insurance and professional pension authority (EIOPA) with the same findings. The percentage of funds which are considered “potentially falsely active” now is about 16%. We have also carried out a further study to see if savings investors had information about performance as part of public documentation in key investor information documents (KIID).Newsmanagers : And what did you find?Guillaume Prache : Of the 62 most suspicious funds, with the highest potential to be closet indexers, by the definition of ESMA, meaning with an active share of less than 50%, a tracking error of less than 3%, and a correlation ratio of over 0.95, we found that 34% of these funds were out of limits by our estimation. These funds do not publish the performance of their benchmarks at the same time as their own performance. This seems to run against European regulations, and at any rate renders it impossible for savings investors to evaluate the performance of funds in relation to their benchmark indices.Newsmanagers : Has the viewpoint of regulators changed since?Guillaume Prache : ESMA tends to say that national regulators should handle the issue. In the sample I have just told you about, 59% of funds are based in Luxembourg, while the others are in the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland, and Belgium.…Read the rest of the interview on the French version of http://www.newsmanagers.com
