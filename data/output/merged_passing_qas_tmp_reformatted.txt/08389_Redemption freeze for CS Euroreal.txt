Redemption freeze for CS Euroreal


Credit Suisse held out a good week before following the example of KanAm and SEB AM, but the open-ended real estate fund CS Euroreal (EUR6.28bn in assets as of the end of March) is now suspending redemptions for an initial period of 3 months. On 12 May, though, Credit Suisse had stated that the pace of redemptions had slowed. The management firm has placed the blame for these redemptions clearly on net outflows triggered by the publication of proposed legislation for “the protection of investors and improvement of the functioning of capital markets” by the German federal finance minister on 3 May. From 1 October until the end of April, the CS Euroreal fund saw net subscriptions of EUR404m, but the trend was reversed following the publication of an early draft of the bill in the press. Credit Suisse emphasizes that the suspension of redemptions is exclusively due to liquidity considerations. It also states that net asset value will continue to be calculated on a daily basis and that subscriptions will continue to be possible. Including the CS Euroreal fund, about EUR16bn in assets have been frozen following the publication of the German draft bill, out of a total of EUR89.9bn in open-ended real estate funds. These funds saw EUR3.2bn in net subscriptions in first quarter, their best result in 7 years.
