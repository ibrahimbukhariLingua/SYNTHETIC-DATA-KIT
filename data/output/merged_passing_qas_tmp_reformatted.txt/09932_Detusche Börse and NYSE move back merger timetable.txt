Detusche Börse and NYSE move back merger timetable


Detusche Börse and NYSE Euronext have delayed a 31 March 2012 deadline to finalise their planned merger, in the hopes of convincing the European Commission to grant approval for the operation, totalling nearly EUR7bn, the news agency Reuters reports. The two stock market firms, which had signed a merger agreement on 14 February this year, last week informed the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that they were extending the initial deadline, set for 31 December. The delay comes after a month of intense lobbying by the two groups at the European Commission, the final obstacle to their marriage, which would give rise to the world’s largest stock market operator. The European Commission is concerned that the firm would have a monopoly on futures and options in Europe, and has asked the two platforms, which control a total of more than 90% of transactions in Europe between them, to propose solutions, but these proposals have so far not convinced the Commission.
