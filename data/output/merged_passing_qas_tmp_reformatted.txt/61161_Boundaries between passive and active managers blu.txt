Boundaries between passive and active managers blurring


The boundaries between products that compete against or complement mutual funds are gradually blurring, as distributors and fund houses seek ways to raise assets in tough market conditions, and are becoming more open to developing products outside their usual realms, says the last research"The Cerulli Edge - Asian Monthly Product Trends Edition, May 2017 Issue.» Firms that have traditionally offered active funds, for example, are building passive capabilities or adding exchange-traded funds to multi-asset offerings. It was a different situation just a few years ago, when investors and industry players had more faith in pure actives and viewed passives as strong competitors.Sometimes, the nature of competitor products generates opportunities for fund providers, either because they use mutual funds as underlying assets, or because companies that structure the products outsource assets to external managers. For instance, Chinese banks farm out part of their wealth management product assets to trusts, fund management companies’ segregated accounts and subsidiaries, and securities firms.
