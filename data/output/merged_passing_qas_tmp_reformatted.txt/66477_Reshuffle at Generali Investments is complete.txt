Generali is continuing on a streak. After announcing last week that it was in exclusive talks with Sycomore, the Italian insurer this Monday announced that the planned reorganisation of Generali Investments (NewsManagers of 20 August 2018) has been completed as of 1 October. Generali Investments Europe S.p.A.

Società di gestione del risparmio on the other. The support functions for the two firms will be provided by Generali Investments Holding S.p.A. Generali Investments will continue to be the shared brand for the asset management firms of the Generali group.The first firm, Generali Insurance Asset Management S.p;A. Società di gestione del risparmio (GIMA), offers a track record in the area of liability-driven investment (LDI) solutions, aimed at insurance portfolios and pension funds, and a variety of internal analysis tools which have been developed to support LDI management. The firm is led by Santo Borsellino, CEO. Generali Investments Partners S.p. A. Società di gestione del risparmio (GIP), for its part, aims to be the driver of growth for the activity, in terms of the number of external clients, and assets under management. Portfolio management will concentrate on the development of unconstrained investment strategies, via internal and external expertise. These will come through the acquisition of specialist investment boutiques. The firm is led by Carlo Trabattoni, CEO.
