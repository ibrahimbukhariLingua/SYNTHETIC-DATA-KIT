Japanese blogs inspire creation of a hedge fund


A former Goldman Sachs banker, Hideki Furusho, has teamed up with a professor at Tokyo university, Yutaka Matsuo, to launch a hedge fund which will trade futures on the Nikkei 225, using a model that analyses posts on Japanese blogs, Bloomberg reports. The fund hopes to generate 20% returns by tracking and analysing about 20 million Japanese blogs, looking for keywords that could have a potential influence on price movements on Nikkei futures.
