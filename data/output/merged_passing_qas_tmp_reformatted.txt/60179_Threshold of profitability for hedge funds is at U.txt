Threshold of profitability for hedge funds is at USD86m in assets


Hedge funds start to earn profits once assets reach above USD86m on average. Meanwhile, more than one third of emerging funds reach profitability with only USD50m or less, a study entitled “ Alive & Kicking : The Next Generation of Hedge Fund Firms,” published on Thursday by the Alternative Investment Management Association and GPP, has found. The survey covered 135 emerging managers with less than USD500m in assets under management each. The hedge funds represent USD16bn in total assets.“This is a significant finding, since other surveys of the industry overall have suggested that the profitability threshold is at several hundred million dollars,” says Jack Inglis, CEO of AIMA, in the foreword to the study.In terms of strategies, macro hedge funds have the most difficulty reaching the break-even point (USD132m is needed). The break-even point is easier to reach for hedge funds specialised in credit, at USD77m.The study also finds that more than 80% of hedge funds are planning to increase their personnel in the next 12 months. These expansion plans concern mainly hedge funds which manage long/short equities, event-driven, and multi-strategy funds.
