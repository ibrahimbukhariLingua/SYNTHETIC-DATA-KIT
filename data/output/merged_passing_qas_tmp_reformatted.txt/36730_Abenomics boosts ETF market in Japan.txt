p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Abenomics, which refers to the budgetary and monetary recovery plan, accompanied by structural reforms, put in place by the government of Shinzo Abe in Japan, appears to be fully benefiting the local ETF market, according to Asia Asset Management. On 19 June this year, the Nikkei 225 index reached USD21.3bn (JPY2.160trn) in assets. Over the 12 months to the end fo May, the fund gained USD4.4bn (JPY445.5bn), the highest growth rate among the 119 ETF funds domiciled in Japan. This performance is all the more remarkable when it is considered that it is not the result of a market effect, as in the period, the underlying index composed of the 225 largest Japanese caps did not grow. Since its launch in 2001, the fund has attracted funds from both institutional and retail investors. Between the end of 2012 and the end of 2013, volumes traded on the Japanese ETF market were multiplied by a factor of five.
