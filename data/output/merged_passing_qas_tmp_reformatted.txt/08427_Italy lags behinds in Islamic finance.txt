Italy lags behinds in Islamic finance


Islamic finance worldwide is expected to measure USD1.4trn in 2010, and USD1.6trn by 2012. But Italy will not be able to capture more than a small fraction of this total, since its legal system is not designed to be compatible with investment instruments that respect Sharia law, Il Sole â€“ 24 Ore reports. So far, no legislation has been proposed to address this issue, and the country is still in the phase of gaining awareness of it, while other countries such as France, the United Kingdom, and Germany have already adapted their legislative frameworks.
