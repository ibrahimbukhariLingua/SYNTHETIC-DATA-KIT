Investors Against Genocide wins a second victory against PetroChina


Following the pension fund TIAA-CREF, which announced on 4 January that it had liquidated its USD58m stake in PetroChina at the end of September, the management firm Capital Group has also followed the recommendations of the association Investors Against Genocide (IAG) and announced that it has sold off all the shares in PetroChina which had been held in the portfolios of three American Funds (EuroPacific Growth, Capital Income Builder and Capital World Growth), which represented a total of USD190m. The IAG association points the finger at Vanguard, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton, which it accuses of remaining passive and retaining significant stakes in businesses which, like PetroChina, are implicated in genocidal acts now taking place (as in Darfur, Sudan).
