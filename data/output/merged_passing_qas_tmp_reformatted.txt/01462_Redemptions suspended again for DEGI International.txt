Redemptions suspended again for DEGI International


Aberdeen Immobilien KAG announced on Tuesday that it has once again frozen redemptions from its open-ended real estate fund DEGI International for a period of three months. Redemptions from the fund were previously frozen between the end of October 2008 and the end of January 2009. In addition, DEGI International funds (EUR2.02bn in assets as of the end of September) and DEGI Europa (EUR1.71bn) will no longer accept subscriptions due to forthcoming sales of properties in their portfolios. Aberdeen reports that after redemptions were reopened on 30 January, outflows from DEGI International gradually diminished, from EUR260m in February to EUR18m in May. But in June, public controversy in Germany over the risk of losses from real estate funds triggered a rise in redemption demands, and in third quarter, DEGI International underwent net redemptions of EUR250m.
