Outsourcing Working Group publishes recommendations


The working group on outsourcing set up in July at the initiative of what was formerly known as the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the Outsourcing Working Group (OWG), submitted its report (see attachment) on 9 December to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The document sets the major principles concerning oversight and the resilience of subcontracting activities.In summary, the report recommends that asset management firms improve surveillance of their outsourcing contracts, analysing risks and preparing exit planning solutions to ensure that they will be easily able to change providers in case of need.
