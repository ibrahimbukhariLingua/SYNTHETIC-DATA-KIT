Smaller and younger hedge funds have better performance


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The fourth annual study by PerTrac Financial Solutions of the performance of hedge funds finds htat in 2009, funds two years old or less earned average returns of 19.81%, compared with 18.65% for funds aged 2-4 years, and 19.80% for those more than four years old. The trend to outperformance for the youngest funds continues, but the differences are shrinking, probably because the number of hedge funds launched in 2008 and early 2009 was significantly lower. Small hedge funds (with up to USD100m) and mid-sized funds (USD100-500m) posted average returns of 19.78% and 20.18%, respectively, compared with 17% for those with over USD500m. This confirms a trend observed from January 1996 to December 2007, and offsets 2008, when the large funds lost only 14.10%, compared with 17.03% for small funds. However, Meredith Jones, director, strategic consulting at Barclays Capital, who collaborated on the study with PerTrac, says that potential performance often comes with high volatility. That could explain why in 2008, a year when all categories of funds saw losses, small funds were deeper in the red than mid-sized or large funds.
