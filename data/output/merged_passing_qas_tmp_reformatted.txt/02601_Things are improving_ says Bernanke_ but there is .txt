Things are improving, says Bernanke, but there is still a lot left to do


In his address on Friday, 21 August, to the annual meeting of economists at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, organized by the United States Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, its chairman, claimed that the US economy has “avoided the worst,” and that it appeared to be stabilizing, with “good” prospects of a return to positve growth in the short term, La Tribune reports. The rebound will likely be “relatively slow at the beginning,” in light of considerable difficulty in gaining access to credit for many households and businesses. Bernanke insisted that “a new financial regulatory framework” needs to be created in the United States and in the world, which would draw “lessons from the crisis, and which would prevent a repetition of the events of the past two years.” Jean-Claude Trichet, chairman of the European Central Bank, has also stated that there is a mountain of work to be done, and that regulatory changes are needed to restore the stability of the financial system.
