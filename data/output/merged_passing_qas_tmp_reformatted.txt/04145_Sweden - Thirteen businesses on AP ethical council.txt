Sweden - Thirteen businesses on AP ethical council watch list


In its annual report for 2008, the Ethical Council for the Swedish public pension funds AP reports that thirteen companies remain on its watch list, IPE reports. Six of these are on the list exclusively due to environmental issues: Chevron Corporation (in Ecuador), Duke Energy Corporation (in the United States), Freeport-McMorran Copper & Gold (in Indonesia), Grupo Ferrovial (in Poland), PetroChina (in China), and Rio Tino (in Indonesia), while Vedanta Resources is on both lists due to environmental and human rights issues in India. AES Corp and Yahoo! are both accused of shortfalls in human rights in Panama and China, respectively. Three companies are on the list due to labour rights questions: Bridgestone in Liberia, Toyota Motor in the Philippines, and Wal-Mart Stores in the United States. Lastly, Thales is on the list due to corruption in South Africa.Last year, the Ethical Council removed Sodexo, BHP Billiton and the Nigerian affiliate of Chevron from the list due to improvements in their performance in 2007. L3 Communications was removed from the list since the AP funds decided to liquidate their participations in the firm due to violations of human rights in an Iraqi prison and due to the fact that two affiliates of the group are involved in the manufacture of cluster bombs.
