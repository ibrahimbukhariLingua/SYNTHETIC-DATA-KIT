Prim’Finance converts its agriculture fund to UCITS III format


From 8 June, the FCP fund Prim’Kappa Agri, managed by the French asset management firm Prim’Finance, will be compliant with the UCITS III directive. At that time, it will adopt the name Prim’Agriculture. Several changes to the product have been made. While previously, the management objective was to obtain performance via an investment in soft commodity futures contracts, the fund will now be exposed via an investment in swaps based on indices or sub-indices of soft commodities and meats futures contracts. The benchmark for the fund is also changing, from the S&P GSCO Agricultural Total Return to S&P SGCI Agriculture & Livestock Total Return (code BLOOMBERG: SPGSALTR Index). The investment strategy used after the adaptation will differ from the strategy used previously mostly in the type of financial instruments which will be eligible to be used by the fund to expose the portfolio to its investment universe, and in the diversification rules which will be applicable. Exposure to commodities markets will remain the same, and will still vary between 0% and 100%.
