UBP bets on organic growth


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } After contributing greatly to banking consolidation in Switzerland, Union Bancaire Privée is now betting primarily on organic growth, since attractive acquisitions in Switzerland will be increasingly rare. “I will be happy to be able to increase our assets under management to CHF150m in the next two to three years,” says Guy de Picciotto, CEO of UBP, in a column in Finanz und Wirtschaft. As of the end of 2017, assets under management at the Geneva-based private bank totalled CHF125bn. However, the UBP head says he is still scanning the market for good acquisition opportunities. The scope of the search has become wider. “Acquisitions are likely to be made outside Switzerland, for example in London or Luxembourg. It would be particularly interesting to make an acquisition in Asia, where we still have few clients,” he explains.
