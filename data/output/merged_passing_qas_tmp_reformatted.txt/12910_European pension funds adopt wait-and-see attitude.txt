European pension funds adopt wait-and-see attitude to market turbulence


The turbulence which has been drying up financial markets in the past few days has led European pension funds to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, according to the website IPE. Several Netherlands pension funds have decided not to make any changes to their investment policy, and in the short term to strictly adhere to their long-term strategy. In other words, even though changes are not ruled out, European pension funds, which have also drawn lessons from the financial crisis of 2007-2008 by improving their liquidity risk management, do not want to allow their long-term strategy to be dictated by short-term volatility on the financial markets.
