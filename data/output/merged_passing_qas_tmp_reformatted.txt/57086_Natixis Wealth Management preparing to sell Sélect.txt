Natixis Wealth Management preparing to sell Sélection 1818


Rumours of a total or partial sale of Sélection 1818 which have been circulating for some time have recently been confirmed by the management of the company itself. In a letter to clients, the fund platform dedicated to French independent financial advisers (CGP), an affiliate of La Banque Privée 1818 within the Natixis group, has announced that its shareholder has retained “a business bank on a mandate to review our strategic options to allow us to undertake a recomposition of the capital of Sélection 1818.” In the letter, Napoleon Gourgaud, CEO of Sélection 1818, says that he has “recently received expressions of interest from competitors and players who would like to gain a foothold” in the CGP market.The firm says that it has EUR6.3bn in assets, two thirds of which are invested in life insurance policies, and one third in securities accounts, for more than 35,000 clients. The platform now works with nearly 650 of the most active brokers and CIF on the market.The announcement comes at a time when Natixis on Monday announced a new strategic plan, under which management and private banking activities have been remodelled and renamed, with three-year inflow targets. For example, Banque Privée 1818 has become Natixis Wealth Management. At a day with analysts, Jean Raby, head of the savings and asset management unit, which has been found to be unprofitable, will be changing strategies. The activity will work more with the investment banking and finance parts of Natixis, to offer credit capacities to high net worth clients, but will also be rationalised. Because the unit is too “diffuse” and can no longer “work for all types of clients,” stronger segmentation of clients will be made, with the objective of bringing clients up the range. “We also need to have more efficient processes,” says Raby.
