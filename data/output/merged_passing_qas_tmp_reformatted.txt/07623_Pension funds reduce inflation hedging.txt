Pension funds reduce inflation hedging


In the second quarter of 2010, UK pension funds decreased their inflation hedging by nearly a third compared to the first quarter of the year, but have maintained similar levels of interest rate hedging, according to the latest F&C LDI Survey. Inflation hedging was unusually high at the start of the year, but by early April RPI swap levels looked unattractively high, with 30 year RPI swap rates reaching 3.9% - as high as at any time since summer 2008. This fall in inflation hedging can be attributed to the combination of unattractive market levels, an acute and prolonged period of pre-election wariness and renewed concerns about the prospects of a “double-dip” recession and deflationary fears, all of which has meant that a considerable volume of potential hedging activity was put on hold.
