Real estate fund commissions swallow up rental revenues


According to a report by the law firm Moreno-Luque, Spanish funds charge total management fees ranging from 1.6% (Segurfondo Inversi√≥n) to 3.4% (Santander Banif Inmobiliario), while their German counterparts as a general rule charge only 0.75%. These commissions swallow up the entirety of rental revenues earned by Spanish funds.The law firm states that in 2003-2008, the Santander Banif Inmobiliario earned commissions of EUR640m, which is equal to the total net amount of rental revenues.
