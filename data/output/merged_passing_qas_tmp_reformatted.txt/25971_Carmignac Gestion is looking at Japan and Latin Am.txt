Carmignac Gestion is looking at Japan and Latin America


In an interview with Bluerating, Didier Saint-George, a member of the investment committee at Carmignac Gestion, has announced that following the opening of a new office in Zurich, “we have no plans to extend ourselves into other countries, but we are continuing to consolidate our activities in Europe.” He nuances this: “We are, however, looking with interest at opportunities in South America and East Asia,” meaning Japan. “So far, this is merely a matter of studying which of our products may be of interest in these countries,” Saint-George concludes.
