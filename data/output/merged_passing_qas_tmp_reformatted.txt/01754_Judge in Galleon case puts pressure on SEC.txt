Judge in Galleon case puts pressure on SEC


US District Judge Jed S. Rakoff, who is in charge of the insider trading case against the founder of the hedge fund Galleon, Raj Rajaratnam, and his suspected accomplices, is requiring the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to prepare for a civil suit which may begin in five months’ time, the Wall Street Journal reports. The unusual demand may require the SEC to produce evidence of the defendants’ guilt even before their criminal trial.
