Europe - Euroclear finds ten partners to promote Fundsettle


Euroclear has announced that it has signed a partnership with ten major management firms (AllianceBernstein, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Invesco, JPMorgan Asset Management, Pictet Asset Management, Pioneer Investments, Robeco Asset Management, Schroders Investment Management, Société Générale Asset Management and Virmont SARL, formerly known as Alken Asset Management), to offer incentives to promote a transition to automatic transactions at the 50% of distributors who are not yet using the STP FundSettle transaction processing and settlement system from Euroclear. A wholly electronic transaction processing system for funds would save the asset management sector about EUR300m per year, Euroclear estimates.All asset servicing and custody activities will be free for new distributors who sign up for FundSettle. Fund distributors who use the STP FundService system from FundSettle pay EUR0.75 per transaction for routing and settlement of a buy or sell order, compared with an average commission of EUR7 by other means. In addition, distributors can rationalise their back-office by using FundSettle as a unique access point, and would reduce their risk levels through the automatisation of these processes.
