Nelson Peltz wants to dismantle Legg Mason


The troubles are not over for Legg Mason, following the recent resignation of its CEO, Mark Fetting: Mutual Fund Wire reports that, according to the Baltimore Sun, Nelson Peltz, the activist shareholder who founded the alternative asset management firm Trian Fund Management, and who owns 10.9% of Legg Mason, is planning to dismantle the group and sell off or spin off some of its nine asset management affiliates, including Western Asset Management. The departure of Fetting leaves the way open for Peltz to take control of Legg Mason.
