ETFs are also trading tools


“With ETFs, we have a fantastic product, but recently we have focused above all on the bad points. In 2008, no ETFs were closed. When the Fukushima disaster happened, ETFs stayed open. That’s something we should stress. We deliver what we promise: we are diversified, we are regulated, and we are open for trading,” Thorsten Michalik, head of db x-trackers, said at an open session at the InsideETFs Europe days, held Tuesday and Wednesday in Amsterdam.Michalik claims this last point is one to emphasize now. He estimates that the ETF industry should do more to highlight the fact that ETFs are also trading tools, and to improve the tradability of these products, with lower spreads. Spreads remain higher in Europe than in the United States, he says.However, Michalik thinks that investors in ETFs are already using these products as trading tools. “Since 2011, for equities, investors in ETFs are more active than active managers themselves,” he says. The ETF turnover is 25% of equity turnover in the US, compared with 6% in Europe.There is thus huge potential for the ETF sector in Europe in this area.In order to make products more easy to trade, an area which Michalik considers more important than trading costs, the creation of an ETF association remains necessary, Michalik says. “EFAMA, the European fund and asset management association, may help us when there are problems, but in questions of trading, we need an association to represent us,” he says. When asked later about this subject, Michalik adds that such a structure will be created this year.“If we stress our strengths, which are that we are diversified, highly regulated and open for trading, the next few years will be fantastic for ETFs,” he concludes.
