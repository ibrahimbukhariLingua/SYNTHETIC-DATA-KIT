Vanguard launches first actively managed ESG fund


Vanguard launched its first actively managed environmental, social and governance (ESG) fund, Global ESG Select Stock Fund. The fund is now accepting investments during a two-week subscription period concluding on 4 June2019, when it is expected to begin trading. The fund’s advisor, Wellington Management, will focus on enhancing long-term returns and controlling risks by focusing on ESG practices that can materially impact shareholder returns. The firm will employ an active portfolio integration strategy that will identify and select about 40 companies that demonstrate exemplary, long-standing ESG practices, strong business fundamentals and prudent capital allocation. To fully align the fund’s corporate governance responsibilities with its investment mandate, Wellington Management will also be responsible for voting and engagement activities for the fund. Intended to be used within an existing diversified portfolio, the fund is designed for investors who wish to invest in companies with leading ESG practices and strong business fundamentals, as identified by Wellington Management. At times, the fund may hold companies that would be omitted by some exclusionary ESG strategies, so the fund may not be ideal for investors seeking to exclude particular sectors or companies involved in activities that are at odds with their individual values. Expense ratios of the fund will be comprised between 0.45% and 0.55%. Currently Vanguard’s actively managed funds represent $1.3trnin assets under management across equity, bond, and balanced assets.
