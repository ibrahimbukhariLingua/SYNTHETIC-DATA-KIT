Sparinvest plans to offer global fixed-income products in Europe using Brandes as a sub-advisor for North American corporate bonds. It is envisaged that the first jointly-managed products will be introduced in the first quarter of 2011, with Sparinvest launching a fund product in Europe, and Brandes seeding a pooled fund in the United States.The two firms’ value bond teams have complementary strengths in the corporate credit asset class, and between them cover the two regions that comprise the substantial majority of the world’s non-governmental debt.
