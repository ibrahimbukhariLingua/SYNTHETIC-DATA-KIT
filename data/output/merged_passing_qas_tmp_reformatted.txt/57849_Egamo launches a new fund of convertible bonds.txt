Egamo launches a new fund of convertible bonds


The asset management firm Egamo, an affiliate of the MGEN group, on Tuesday, 24 October announced the launch of the convertible bond fund Egamo Convertibles Euro (ECE). The launch is the result “of a desire on the part of Egamo to support the evolution of the investment needs of its clients, both from a financial and reguatory viewpoint,” the firm says in a statement. The new fund will adopt the top-down fundamental management process of Egamo, which combined analysis of large macroeconomic data and data from issuers, regarding both financial and extra-financial dimensions. The Egamo Convertibles Euro fund, invested wholly in live securities, is managed jointly by Said Djaba and Damien Orliec, who have portfolio management experience of 23 and 8 years, respectively.
