African funds of funds hold out better in market turbulence


In an unstable market environment, funds of funds dedicated to Africa appear to be an oasis of stability. According to the hedge fund data provider PerTrac and HedgeNews Africa, a firm specialised in news about alternative management in Africa, African funds of funds have not only outperformed the market in periods of falling markets between July 2009 and July 2011, but they have even provided returns that are less correlated and volatile than the market. In bear markets in the past two years, the composite fund of fund index from HedgeNews Africa has outperformed the S&P 500 TR by 42.93%, and the MSCI EAFE-Neet by 38.55%. Returns for the composite fund of funds index remained in a range of total net fluctuation of -2% to +2%, while the S&P 500 TR and the MSCI EAFE-Net were in the -10% to +10% range. PerTrac has published the findings under a new agreement with HedgeNews Africa, whose database will be added to the PerTrac analysis platform aimed at fund investors and managers.
