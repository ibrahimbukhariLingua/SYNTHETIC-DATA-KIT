Low-cost funds gaining ground


British investors allocated a larger proportion of their assets to low-cost products in the five years to the end of December 2013, according to a study by Vanguard Asset Management («Costs matter: Are UK investors voting with their feet?”).The study states that in the five years to 31 December 2013, low-cost funs dedicated to equities attracted 112% (GBP129bn) of total inflows in the period, while low-cost funds represented 52% (GBP118bn) of the total for bond funds.Several factors have contributed to this development: the impact of RDR regulations, the transition to defined-contribution pension plans, and an uncertain market environment with modest outlooks for returns.The study shows that the majority of investors invested in less costly funds, with the trend more marked for equities. The cost of an investment in an actively-managed fund also remained stable in the period, while the cost of an investment in a passive strategy was significantly reduced. According to data from Morningstar, fees as a proportion of assets fell from 0.55% to 0.35% for a passively-managed equity fund between 2009 and 2013, and from 0.48% to 0.18% for a bond fund of the same type.
