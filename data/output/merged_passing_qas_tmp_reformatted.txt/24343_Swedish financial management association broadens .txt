Swedish financial management association broadens its membership rules


The Swedish investment fund association has for the first time since its inception in 1979 modified its membership rules, in order to widen its member base. Managers with asset management activities not previously defined as such may now join the association, which has also created a membership status for associate members, to apply to all firms with ties to the accounting and legal providers, system providers, and fund administrators. The association currently has 38 members.
