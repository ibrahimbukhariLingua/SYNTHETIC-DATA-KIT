Vontobel Fund – Global Corporate Mid Yield, registered in Luxembourg, is managed by Christian Hantel. Hantel claims that the segment is underexploited and thus allows attractive gains for investors. The manager has many years of experience in the segment, as he had previously been a bond manager at Swisscanto and head of corporate credit at BNY Mellon AM, where he managed crossover and investment grade mandates, a statement says.
