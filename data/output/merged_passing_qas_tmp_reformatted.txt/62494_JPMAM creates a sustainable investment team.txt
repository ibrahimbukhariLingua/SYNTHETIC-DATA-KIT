JPMAM creates a sustainable investment team


J.P. Morgan Asset Management has formed the Sustainable Investment Leadership Team (SILT), led by Jamie Kramer, global head of product strategy and ESG lead. “The SILT initiative brings together senior leaders, portfolio managers and client advisers to drive a globally coordinated strategy for sustainable investing and to help clients achieve their ESG investment objectives,” a press statement explains.“SILT sits at the heart of our organisation and taps into decades of ESG expertise across investment teams, governance specialists and clients facing advisors. It brings together insights and best practices across investment capabilities. Formalising this global leadership team creates a driving force to shape and communicate our ESG capabilities around our clients’ needs,” said Kramer.JP Morgan AM has incorporated ESG factors into our research driven processes for years, analysing their impact on future cash flows. Additionally, the asset management firm in December last year launched a best-in-class mutual fund as part of its Luxembourg SICAV: JPMorgan Funds – Europe Sustainable Equity Fund. The fund has the MSCI Europe as its benchmark index, and is managed by Richard Webb, Joanna Crompton and William Johnson.The approach of the Europe Sustainable Equity Fund, based on the European investment approach based on behavioural finance research by JP Morgan, is to identify European businesses with high quality, attractive valuations and governance which promotes good long-term visibility in terms of sustainability. The companies will be valued according to their results in the area of SRI issues, with the objective of generating solid risk-adjusted perfomance, by exposing the fund to companies which are socially repsonsible and encourage improvement through construcive and active dialogue with corporate heads.
