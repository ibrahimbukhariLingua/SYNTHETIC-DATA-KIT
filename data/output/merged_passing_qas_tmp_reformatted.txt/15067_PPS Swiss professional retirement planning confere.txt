PPS Swiss professional retirement planning conference special: Migros pension fund delays and cuts benefits


At the 3rd annual PPS conference in Geneva, Christoph Ryter, manager of the Migros pension fund (CHF16.8bn), explained that in order to achieve its objectives, his institution would need to earn annual returns of 4.6%, but that in light of current conjuncture, models projected that they could hope for no more than 4.4%.In these conditions, the management team has turned to its trustees, among whom employees are “over-represented,” to take corrective measures. Following a serious study of asset and liability management, the competent authorities agreed with the arguments of the fund managers and agreed to take into account longevity risk and the low interest rate environment. This led to the adoption of a delay in the retirement age to the age of 64 instead of 63, and a slight reduction in benefits for those who have made 39 years for contributions, at a reduced conversion rate of 70.1%, rather than 74.2% as of 1 January 2012, in line with a measure which Switzerland as a whole voted to pass on 7 March 2010. Christoph Ryter and his team will not alter their strategic allocation, however: 40% to bonds, 30% to equities, and 30% to physical real estate. Of this total, 85% are invested in a traditional manner, and 15% are invested in satellites for these asset clases. However, Migros will retain defined benefits, and will not switch over like other pension funds to defined contributions.
