LGIM also recruits from SLI


Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) on 14 September announced that it has recruited Lance Philips as head of active equities. He will begin in early 2013, and will report directly to the CEO, Mark Zinkula. Philips has recently left Standard Life Investments (SLI), where he was head of overseas and global equities (see Newsmanagers of 14 September), at a time when Invesco has announced that it has recruited three multi-asset class managers from the same firm.
