Households withdraw investments from stock markets


Scepticism of stock markets has reached a peak, according to the 15th edition of a TNS Sofres survey undertaken for La Banque Postale and Les Echos. After a virtually uninterrupted slide in the value of indices since summer, on the back of concern about sovereign debt, retail investors are massively turning away from the markets. Only 9% of French respondents consider it a “good time” to place some of their savings in the stock markets, a level not seen since the survey began in 2004, while 93% consider stocks risky, and 82% have the same opinion of bonds, also an all-time high. But investors’ scepticism also extends to other financial products: life insurance is less and less popular with French investors, who are instead opting for savings accounts.
