Julius Baer builds presence in capital of Kairos Investment Management


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Swiss private bank Julius Baer has announced plans to increase its stake in the capital of the Italian wealth and asset management firm Kairos Investment Management up to a maximum of 80%. Julius Baer, a shareholder in Kairos for 19.9% since 2013, has decided to acquire an additional 60.1% of capital, for an undisclosed amount. The transaction will be completed during 2016, Julius Baer says in a statement. Meanwhile, Julius Baer and Kairos have decided to launch the Italian asset management firm on the Milan stock exchange in a second phase. “This operation will significantly strengthen the long-term position of Juluis Baer and Kairos in Italy, and will assist Kairos in its ambitious growth trajectory,” the Swiss bank has announced. After the transaction, Paolo Basilico, founding partner, chairman and CEO of Kairos, and his partners will continue to lead day-to-day activities with the same team and the same customer-focused strategy, Julius Baer says. The current shareholders in the asset management firm, including some of its managers, will retain a significant stake in the capital of Kairos after its initial public offering. Since Julius Baer entered the capital of Kairos in 2013, the Italian asset management firm has seen lightining growth. Its assets under management have nearly doubled, from EUR4.5bn to EUR8bn.
