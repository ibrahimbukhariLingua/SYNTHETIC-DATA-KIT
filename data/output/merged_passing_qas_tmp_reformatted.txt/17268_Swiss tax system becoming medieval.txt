Swiss tax system becoming medieval


The Swiss taxation system is in the process of becoming “medieval,” the lawyer and professor of law Xavier Oberson in Geneva claims. “We haven’t taken the time to look at it as a whole. We are in the process of removing all sorts of loopholes, but we are in danger of finding ourselves with a very bulky taxation system, which is not competitive, and completely outdated – a medieval system,” the specialist, who is regularly consulted by the Swiss government, claims in an interview published on 27 December by the newspaper Le Temps. “We see it in corporate taxation: under pressure from the European Union, we need to change the system, but in what direction? It’s the prerogative of Genevan finance minister David Giler to propose something and open the debate: discontinue special tax breaks, place all corporations on an even footing,” Oberson says. On the subject of banking confidentiality, it’s a question for the Swiss domestically also. If the country moves in that direction, withholding tax doesn’t make any sense either, since it developed out of a fraud prevention mechanism, intended to compensate for the guarantee of banking confidentiality, the professor claims. “My idea, therefore, is to rethink withholding tax in order to make it a final tax withheld at the source,” Oberson explains. “We would tax all capital gains, and under international agreements, we would even open up a way for Swiss taxpayers to make a voluntary declaration to settle past tax debts with a single sum.”
