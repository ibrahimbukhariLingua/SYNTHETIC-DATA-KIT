ETF price war benefits small investors


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The growing use of ETFs by independent financial advisers is set to further increase, as platforms reduce, and often simply waive fees for this type of product, the Wall Street Journal reports. TD Ameritrade Holding Corp has become the most recent management firm to launch a salvo in the price war: on Friday, it announced that it has decided to offer over 100 ETFs with no commissions, both for retail investors and financial advisers who use its platforms. The offer is valid for investors who remain invested in the funds for at least 30 days.TD Ameritradeâ€™s initiative follows similar moves by Charles Schwab, E*Trade Financial, Fidelity Investment and Vanguard.
