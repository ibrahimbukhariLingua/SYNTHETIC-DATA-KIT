US money market funds return to euro zone banks


US prime money market funds have increased their exposure to euro zone banks by 15% in US dollars since the end of December, according to the most recent Fitch report on the subject, dated 23 February. This is a reversal of the trend after several months of reductions. This increase in interest has worked to the benefit of French banks, to which exposure has increased by 150%. US money market funds now have 11% of their assets invested in euro zone banks, which is far below the 31% they had invested there as of the end of May. This reduction has been primarily driven by aversion to risk, as these vehicles traditionally allocate more than 30% to euro zone banks, according to Fitch data from 2006 to mid-2011.
