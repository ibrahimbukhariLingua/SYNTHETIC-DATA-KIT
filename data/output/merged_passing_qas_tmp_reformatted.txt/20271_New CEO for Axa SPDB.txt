New CEO for Axa SPDB


Following the resignation of Qian Hua, who had been in the position since December 2010, Axa SPDB appointed Yu Beihua as CEO. She had previously been head of the retail banking activity at China Merchant Bank in Shanghai. Z-Ben Advisors points out thath this time, the recruitment is a sign of a desire to recruit a competent manager rather than a candidate presented by a shareholder.
