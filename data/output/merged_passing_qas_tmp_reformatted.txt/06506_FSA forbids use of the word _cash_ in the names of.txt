FSA forbids use of the word “cash” in the names of money market products


According to the Financial Services Authority, the use of the word “cash” in the names of money market funds is “potentially misleading,” as it implies that the capital of subscribers is protected, although the funds may undergo losses if their management commissions cut into the capital in an environment of low interest rates, according to issue 3 of the Life Insurance Newsletter from the regulator (http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/newsletters/life_nov10.pdf).The FSA also points to shortfalls in the areas of governance and/or respect for standards in the underlying investments. It says that it intends to contact the offending managers and to take corrective measures if necessary.
