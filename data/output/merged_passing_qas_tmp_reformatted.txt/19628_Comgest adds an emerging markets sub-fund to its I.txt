Comgest adds an emerging markets sub-fund to its Irish Sicav


In a statement released first in Germany, and then in France, Comgest (EUR13.5bn in assets as of the end of December) on 19 September announced the launch in mid-July of the Comgest Growth Emerging Markets Flex (CGEM Flex) fund, a sub-fund of its UCITS IV-compliant Irish Sicav, Comgest Growth Plc.The new product provides investors with a way to expose themselves to potential growth in emerging markets, while reducing the risk of losses. The objective of the CGEM Flex fund (which already has EUR75m in assets) is to further reduce extreme losses and volatility compared with traditional Comgest strategies.As the asset management firm states, the Comgest Growth Emerging Markets Flex fund is constructed around a portfolio of equities from emerging markets, very similar to those of the Magellan or Comgest Growth Emerging Markets funds.In addition to this equity portfolio, depending on market stress, the fund also invests in a hedging basket, composed exclusively of equity futures. Exposure to equity markets may ultimately vary from 20% to 100%. Adjustment of the hedging level is undertaken daily, and is based on a simple and transparent automated strategy, depending on the level of the VIX index.The fund (I share class ISIN code IE00B8J4DR61, R share class ISIN code IE00B8J4DS78) has already been registered for sale in France, Luxembourg, Germany, and Austria. Registration is underway in Belgium, Italy, the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden.
