Credit: Fitch observes a convergence toward BBB


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } At a time when most sectors have continued their path toward stabilization in second half 2013, there was a convergence of ratings toward investment grade, in the area of BBB, Fitch Ratings estimates in its most recent outlooks on the evolution of credit worldwide. The proportion of negative outlooks and watches fell in all sectors but two, between 1 basis point and 18 basis points, as international public finance had the heaviest fall in the past six months. The enterprise and insurance sectors also had marginal increases. However, the negative trend in ratings is still marked in the sovereign sector, as more than one quarter of developed countries have a negative outlook. “The proportion of BBB ratings has doubled to 27% in the sovereign sector since 2007, and increased by 50% to 36% in financials. For businesses, where the proportion of BBB ratings has remained stable at about 40%, the proportion of ratings above this level has also fallen constantly by nearly one third to just below 20%,” says Monica Insoll, managing director in the credit market research team at Fitch.
