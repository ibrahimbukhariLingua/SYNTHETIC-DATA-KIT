Resolution acquires Friends


“After two rejected bids, the third offer to acquire the British life insurer Friends Provident has proven successful,” L’Agefi reports. “The deal, which values Friends Provident at GBP1.86bn (EUR2.2bn), or 13% more than its market capitalisation, represents Resolution’s first large-scale acquisition, and a first step in its plan to take control of three or four insurers,” the newspaper reports.
