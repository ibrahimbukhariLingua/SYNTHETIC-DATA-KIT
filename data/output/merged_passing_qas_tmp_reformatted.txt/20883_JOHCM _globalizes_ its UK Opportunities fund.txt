It will be managed by Ben Leyland, with the assistance of John Wood; these two senior portfolio managers were already co-managers of the UK Opportunities fund. They will be joined by a dedicated analyst, Robert Lancastle.The new fund will have no benchmark constraint, although performance will be measured by comparison with the MSCI AC World Total Return index. The all-cap fund may invest in equities from developed countries and emerging countries with equally-weighted positions ranging from 2.5% to 4% of assets.CharacteristicsName: JOHCM Global Opportunities FundISIN code: IE00B4XXMP2Front-end fee: 5%Management commission: 2.47%Performance commission: 15% of annual performance exceeding the MSCI AC World TR index
