Research Affiliates awarded patent for methodology


Research Affiliates LLC has been awarded a patent for its methodology for the calculation of indices, which selects and weights securities on the basis of fundamental elements such as dividends, revenues, and profits, but not market capitalisation, the Wall Street Journal reports. The RAFI indices from Research Affiliates are already used as benchmarks for assets of USD27bn, up from USD17bn at the beginning of the year. The patent may pose problems for other index providers, such as WisdomTree (USD5.5bn in assets as of the end of September), whose ETF funds replicate their own indices weighted on the basis of dividends or profits.
