Didier Le Ménestrel says officially open to partnership


“I do not comment rumours,” said Didier Le Ménestrel, chairman and CEO of La Financière de l’Echiquier, when asked Friday morning about a potential takeover from Primonial, at a meeting with the European press. However, the question of whether a partnership with another player would interest him, the founder and director of the French asset management firm was more open. “You can grow by yourself. But it can go so much faster if you find the right partner or make the right acquisition,” he said. “I have always been very active in growing the company,” the director continues. He points out that he has had several different shareholders since the inception of the company in 1991, and that HSBC controlled 50% of capital plus one share for two years. “In the past two years, we were more active, since I want La Financière de l’Echiquier to be a first league asset mangaer.” Le Ménestrel also said that he “wants to be chairnan and CEO of the company.” When asked about the importance of independence, Le Ménestrel says that it is important, as is entrepreneurship. A merger between La Financière de l’Echiquier and Primonial was suggested last week by Distrib Invest, and then in Les Echos (see NewsManagers of 24 November). Between the end of 2016 and the end of October 2017, La Financière de l’Echiquier has seen an increase in its assets from EUR7.6bn to EUR8.98bn. This growth in assets is 60% due to market effects and 40% to inflows, according to Jean-François Bay, director of strategy, development and international.
