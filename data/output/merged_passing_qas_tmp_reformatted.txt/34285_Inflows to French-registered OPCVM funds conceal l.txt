Inflows to French-registered OPCVM funds conceal large outflows from equity funds


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Globally, French collective management has seen its assets increase in October by 0.16%, largely due to net subscriptions totalling EUR8.61bn. This brings total assets under management to EUR776.09bn. According to figures released by Europerformance-SIX Telekurs, however, the various asset classes have not developed in the same ways. Among the pleasant surprises, money market funds posted inflows again, with a new inflow of EUR11.09bn, of which EUR11.06bn were to euro money market funds alone. Bond funds also attracted investors, as the category posted net inflows of EUR697.05m. However, funds invested in equities were defied by investors. The asset class as a whole saw net outflows of EUR2.26bn. Convertible bonds did not post inflows either. Outflows from all categories combined total a net EUR293.34m.
