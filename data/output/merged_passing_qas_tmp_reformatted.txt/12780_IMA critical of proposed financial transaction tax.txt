IMA critical of proposed financial transaction tax


The British investment management association (IMA) has launched a virulent criticism of the French-German proposal for a tax on financial transactions, FundWeb reports. The president of the professional association, Richard Saunders, claims that the tax revenues raised from trades rather than from businesses would really be taxes on the savings of small investors. “Political leaders need to understand that these taxes would not be paid by banks and other intermediaries. Like stamp tax in the United Kingdom, they would be a direct charge to the savings of investors,” he said.
