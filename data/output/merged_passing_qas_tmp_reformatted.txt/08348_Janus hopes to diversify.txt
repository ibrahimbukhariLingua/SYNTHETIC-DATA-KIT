Janus hopes to diversify


Within five to 10 years, Richard M. Weil, chief executive of Janus Capital Group, plans to turn Janus from a firm focused on U.S. stock products into a global, multi-asset-management partner, he said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. Among his priorities is building the company’s fixed-income assets. As of March 31, Janus had USD165.5 billion under management, USD7.8 billion of which is in fixed-income investments. Mr. Weil also wants to develop Janus’s domestic-stock-product lineup, boost its presence in the institutional marketplace, augment its U.S. retail distribution and client-service resources, and add some non-U.S. products, says the WSJ.
