Three board members resign at EFG International


The wealth management firm EFG International on 5 April announced the departure of three members of its board of directors, Michael Higgins, Daniel Zuberbühler and Fong Seng Tee, who will not stand for re-election at the next general shareholders’ meeting. EFG International is seeking a successor to Tee, who was elected to the board only one year ago, but who has decided to take his career in a new direction, a statement says. Robinson will become chairman of the auditing committee, a position previously held by Higgins, while Susanne Branderberger becomes head of the risk committee, replacing Zuberbühler. EFG International has not named successors to the two outgoing members of the board, which had 14 members.
