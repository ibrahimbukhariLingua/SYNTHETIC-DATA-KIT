The Netherlands-based bank Rabobank will have to pay EUR774m in fines in total in three countries for its implication in the Libor and Euribor interest rate manipulation scandal, according to a statement released on 29 October.Rabobank has reached an agreement over fines with the various authorities, and has agreed to pay “approximately EUR774m,” the bank says in a statement, adding that 30 employees were involved in inappropriate conduct.The director of Rabobank, Piet Moerland, has presented his resignation with immediate effect in the light of the findings of the Libor and Euribor investigations, the bank adds. In the interim, the role will be served by Rinus Minderhoud, a member of the supervisory board at the bank since 2002.Fines will be paid to four authorities in three countries: the national prosecutor in the Netherlands, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Department of Justice in the United States.“The professional failure at Rabobank is one of the most severe we have identified for Libor,” said the director of the FCA, Tracey McDermott, in a statement. “Employees at Rabobank treated setting the Libor rate as a potential way to make money, without any consideration for the integrity of the market,” he added; “that is unacceptable.” Rabobank will have to pay about EUR124m to the FCA, the third-largest fine in the history of the FCA.
