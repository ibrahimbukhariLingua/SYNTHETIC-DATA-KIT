Franklin Templeton looking for acquisitions in alternative management


Franklin Templeton is on the lookout for its next purchase, says Financial Times Fund Management, which has interviewed the president and chief executive of Franklin Resources, Greg Johnson. The current search is not for geographical diversification. Instead, the asset manager is looking at different kinds of products its clients are now demanding. The company is seeing more and more demand not just for investment products, but for solutions. “We believe growth in alternatives will outpace traditional securities, so we’re looking for acquisitions in this area,” says Greg Johnson.
