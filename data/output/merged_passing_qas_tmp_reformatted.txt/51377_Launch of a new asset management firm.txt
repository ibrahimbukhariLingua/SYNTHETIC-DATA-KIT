Launch of a new asset management firm


The former founder and CEO of the telecommunications service provider Vocus Communications has launched his own asset management firm, the Financial Standard newspaper reports. James Spenceley launched Vocus in 2008. His firm merged last year with M2 Group to become a top player in the telecommunications infrastructure sector. In parallel, he has been working with a number of clients in the asset management sector, including Gary Rollo, with whom he has now launched MHOR Asset Management. The firm will initially concentrate on the small caps sector.
