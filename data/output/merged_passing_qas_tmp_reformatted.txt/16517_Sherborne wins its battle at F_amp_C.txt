Sherborne wins its battle at F&amp;C


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The activist investor Edward Bramson has won his battle for control of the UK asset management firm F&C, in which he controls 17% of capital via his firm Sherborne Investors. His resolutions to install himself as head of the management firm were massively approved by shareholders at an extraordinary general shaoreholders’ meeting on 3 February, held at his request. 65% of shareholders voted in favour of the departure of Nick MacAndrew, chairman and director of the firm, and 61% voted for the departure of Brian Larcombe from his position as director. 70% of shareholders voted in favour of the appointment of Bramson as director, and he was then appointed the new chairman of F&C. 54.7% and 70.8% of shareholders, respectively, chose to appoint Ian Brindle and Derham O’Neill as members of the board of directors. Total votes on the fice resolutions represented more than 80% of capital issued by F&C. Back in August, Sherborne Investors, which defines itself as an investment company specialised in recovery at troubled businesses, announced its acquisition of a 5% stake in F&C. The stake was then increased, up to the present level of about 17%. At the end of December, Sherborne called for an extraordinary general shareholders’ meeting to replace the current management of the firm.
