Most ethical companies suffered least during the crisis


Businesses which have high ratings for environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues suffered less than others during the crisis of 2008-2009, according to a study by State Street Global Advisors which will be published at the end of this year, which is cited in the firm’s “Vision Focus” report, dedicated to sustainable investment. The most recent research has also showed that the resistance of these businesses to the crisis increased over the same time that the market was in its heaviest decline.The Vision Focus study claims that the global financial crisis contributed to an increase in awareness of ESG issues, as it pointed to the need for “stricter conditions in terms of corporate governance and information requirements, in order to protect the interests of investors.” Chris McKnett, vice president in charge of sustainable investment at State Street Global Advisors, says “new attention to sustainability is in the process of changing the rules of the game for institutional investment. As investors are increasingly requiring that ESG issues be taken into account, businesses with a good ESG rating are likely to become more sought-after shares.”The SSgA study shows that growth in global population, climate change, and a series of other catalysts make sustainability “a substantial question, both for businesses and for investors.”ESG investment, previously considered a passing fad, is growing significantly at a time when global macroeconomic trends indicate that a “sustainability crisis” is taking hold worldwide, the study says. “many investors are requiring more ways to incorporate ESG into their portfolios, which is leading asset managers to improve their product ranges and services as a result,” SSgA notes.
