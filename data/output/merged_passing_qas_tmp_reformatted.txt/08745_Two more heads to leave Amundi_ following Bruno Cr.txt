Two more heads to leave Amundi, following Bruno Crastes


Bruno Crastes will not be the only one to leave Amundi, Agefi reports. Vincent Chaillet, head of international and absolute return bond activities, and Jean-Noël Alba, deputy CEO of CAAM London Branch, his closest partners, will also be leaving. The former spent 15 years at Crédit Agricole Asset Management (CAAM), while the latter spent ten years in his position. Their departures will be effective in a few months’ time. One observer quoted by the newspaper says that the three managers will leave behind EUR30bn in assets, and may launch an entrepreneurial project together.
