Aviva Investors sells SRI activities to Alliance Trust Investments


The UK asset management firm Aviva Investors on Thursday announced that it is transferring its socially responsible investment activity, which represents GBP1.2bn in assets, to its fellow British firm Alliance Trust Investments. The announcement follows a decision by Aviva Investors in January this year to focus on fixed income, multi-asset class solutions, real estate, and equities. The SRI team from Aviva Investors, led by Peter Michaelis, will join Alliance Trust Investmnts, where it will create an SRI capacity. The team will continue to provide investment advising for the eight current SRI funds from Aviva Investors via a management outsourcing contract. Each fund will be managed with the same objective and the same process.
