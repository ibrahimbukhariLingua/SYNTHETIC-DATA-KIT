Audit spells bad news for P2 Value fund from Morgan Stanley


On Monday, Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investment announced that as a safety precaution, it will be freezing subscriptions to the P2 Value real estate fund, which has already been closed to redemptions since the end of October. The measure comes in the wake of the first results of an audit of the portfolio, which suggests that significant devaluations of assets in the portfolio are to be expected.According to professionals, the bad news was foreseeable to the extent that the fund (EUR1.66bn) was launched in November 2005, and the investment phase coincided with a period at which real estate prices were at their peak.The management firm states that gross and net cash positions as of 13 July totalled EUR212.94m and EUR119.64m, or 12.8% and 7.2% of assets.
