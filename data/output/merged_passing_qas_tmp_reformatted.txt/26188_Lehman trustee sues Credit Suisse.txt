Lehman trustee sues Credit Suisse


The team responsible for liquidating the business bank Lehman Brothers has filed a lawsuit in New York bankruptcy court against Credit Suisse, according to the news agency Dow Jones. It accuses the bank of having inflated the losses undergone due to the bankruptcy of the US bank. The trustee is asking for the USD1.2bn sought by Credit Suisse in damages and interest to be lowered by more than USD1bn. He claims that the initial amount is exaggerated and that the claims of Credit Suisse are valid only for about USD75m. He also claims that Credit Suisse owed him CHF150m for international transactions.
