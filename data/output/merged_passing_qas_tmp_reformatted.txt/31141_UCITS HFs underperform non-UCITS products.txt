UCITS HFs underperform non-UCITS products


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } Overall, UCITS-compliant hedge funds are more volatile and underperform their counterparts which are not subject to the UCITS directive, and the country of domicile of a fund is a significant indicator of its potential performance, as those based in Europe show a risk-adjusted performance lower than those registered elsewhere. These are the findings of a survey conducted by the Edhec-Risk Institute of a sample of more than 24,000 individual hedge funds.The study finds that UCITS-compliant hedge funds underperform non-UCITS hedge funds, in total performance as well as risk-adjusted performance. However, UCITS-compliant funds are characterised by more ‘favourable’ liquidity, and, when the liquidity parameter is taken into account, returns for UCITS and non-UCITS hedge funds tend to converge.Edhec also points out that non-UCITS hedge funds in general have volatility and risk far lower than those of non-UCITS hedge funds, which is clearly due to obstacles to the transposition of risk management techniques.Lastly, the study finds that the performance of funds may fluctuate according to the country of domicile, as European funds show lower risk-adjusted returns than funds from other regions, with the best results for funds domiciled in the United States and Asia-Pacific. A similar divergence is also found between the various countries of domicile for UCITS-compliant hedge funds. Funds domiciled in Ireland and Luxembourg generate very similar returns.
