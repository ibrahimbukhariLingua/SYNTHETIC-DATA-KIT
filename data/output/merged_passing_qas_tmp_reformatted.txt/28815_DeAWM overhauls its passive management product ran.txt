DeAWM overhauls its passive management product range


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Institutional Money reports that Simon Klein, head of sales ETFs & ETCs for Europe and Asia, has announced that Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management (DeAWM) is adapting its passively-managed product range to current and future demand on the part of investors. This will result in the liquidation of ETFs and ETCs for which inflows have been inadequate, but particularly for the launch of new products in segments which DeAWM feels will sustain major demand from clients. Applications for sales licenses have already been submitted for some of these. Among the future ETFs and ETCs will be currency-hedged products based on equity indices, inflation-linked bonds worldwide, government bonds worldwide and Spanish and Italian government bonds, and lastly on equity indices of some countries and regions. The funds may use physical or synthetic replication.
