“RSI is dubious of SRI”


Newsmanagers: What are your current asset volumes, and how are they invested?Jean-Luc Vitré: We have about EUR11bn in assets, of which 40% are managed directly, and 60% are outsources to 33 funds, of which 11 are open and 22 are dedicated.Newsmanagers: Why this preference for dedicated funds?Jean-Luc Vitré: We prefer this type of product because it allows us to transpose our regulations to funds, including the requirements of the October 2002 Social Security Code and our own financial regulations. We can then genuinely make our requirements known, and there are no problems later about transparency as a result.Newsmanagers: You have recently expressed some reservations about the pertinence of socially responsible investment (SRI). Why?Jean-Luc Vitré: I have the impression that SRI is above all a preoccupation for retail investors. I have some difficulty seeing the pertinence of the application of extra-financial criteria to fund selection. Multiple studies have attempted to show what contribution this approach makes financially, but the results are never conclusive. The effect appears to be neutral, and SRI asset management is largely a marketing ploy.Newsmanagers: You have also stated that in this area managers could be more exemplary.Jean-Luc Vitré: Quite. As far as I know, no asset management firm applies to itself the same criteria that it describes in the questionnaires they send out to the companies they grade. And in addition, there is the question of what SRI really is. Why, for example, do Swiss rating agencies exclude companies which operate nuclear power stations, while their Belgian counterparts do not exclude them? Governance factors may be used to detect potential trouble to the future of the company (bankruptcies, etc), but nobody is safe from criminal activities, as the Parmalat scandal has shown.
