Omnes Capital sells stake in Capcom


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The private equity firm Omnes Capital on 23 February announced that it is selling its stake in Capcom to the Circet company, a specialist in telecommunications infrastructure in the Frrench market for telecommunications operations. The operation represents the first exit from the midcap fund Omnes Crossiance 4, whose final closing at EUR210m came early in 2017. The sale allows Omnes Capital to earn a multiple of 2.6 times its investment. Omnes Capital entered the capital of Capcom in 2015. At the time of exit the founding partners at Capcom are entering the capital of Circet. Omnes Capital is also investing in this new operation, and is “signing the fifth investment deal for Omnes Croissance 4,” the firm says in a statement.
