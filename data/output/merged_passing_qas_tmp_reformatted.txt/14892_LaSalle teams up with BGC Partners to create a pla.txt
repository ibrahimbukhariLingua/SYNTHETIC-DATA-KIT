LaSalle teams up with BGC Partners to create a platform for real estate derivatives


LaSalle Investment Management (USD43bn in assets) on 18 April announced that it has teamed up with the broker BGC Partners (BGC) to offer clients a structure dedicated to real estate derivatives. In partnership with BGC, LaSalle will set up systems which will allow managers to identify new investment opportunities, and then to carry out a straight through processing, and to receive ongoing assistance. Managers at LaSalle will be able to weight portfolios in terms of geographical region, type of risk, or type of assets, while protecting the investor against potential falls on the markets.Alan Tripp, CEO of LaSalle Investment Management in the UK, says that LaSalle initially will concentrate on the British real estate derivatives market, which is one of the largest. “But we have set up internal processes which will then guarantee the necessary flexibility to increase our geographical coverage over time,” he adds.
