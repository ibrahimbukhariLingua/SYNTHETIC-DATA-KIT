Responsible and sustainable investment does not damage performance


A study of 165 responsible and sustainable investment (IRD) funds in the three-year period to the end of May 2009 by Altedia Investment Consulting has found that investing in this type of product does not necessarily imply a lower level of performance. “Best in Class” funds earn relative returns in line with comparable non-IRD market indexes. The concept appears to be convincing to investors. Despite a difficult market environment, more than half of all “best in Class” funds have posted net subscriptions for the period from May 2008 to May 2009, the study finds. For themed funds (water, renewable energies, etc.), relative returns are less stable than for Best in Class funds, Altedia IC finds. They may be noticeably different from the performance of market indexes, both in an upward and a downward direction, the study finds. Their performance nonetheless totals 6.3% over three years. From May 2008 to May 2009, the average performance of themed funds totalled -24.5%. Despite these losses, thematic funds committed to responsible and sustainable investment have continued to attract subscriptions, which have risen 51.3% in the past year, Altedia notes.
