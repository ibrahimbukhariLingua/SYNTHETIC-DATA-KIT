Fidelity rethinks its cost model ahead of MiFID 2


Fidelity International will reduce its annual management fees and put variable management fees in place related to the performance of funds, as the debate intensifies over the value added by active management. The new management cost model will apply to all actively-managed equity management, the asset management firm with USD303bn in assets under management announced on Tuesday.The variable management fee model will function on the basis of risk and performance sharing (in the model, called “Fulcrum.”) “In other words, when we earn outperformance after fees, we will share it with the client, and when the performance is at the same level as or below the benchmark, clients will benefit from lower levels of fees under the new model. The fees paid by clients will be limited to a range and will be subject to a preset ceiling (maximum) and a floor (minimum),” Fidelity explains in a statement.“These changes will more closely tie results at our business to the performance of the portfolios we manage,” explains Brian Conroy, chairman of Fidelity International.Meanwhile, unlike most asset management firms, Fidelity International has announcd that it will be passing the cost of external research on to investors as miFID 2 comes into effect. But the firm states that “reduction of base management fees will be at least equivalent to the cost of external research.”Additionally, “for clients who simply wish to reduce their costs, and who do not want to pay for active management, we will expand our range of low management cost tracker funds, for all our clients,” Fidelity International says.
