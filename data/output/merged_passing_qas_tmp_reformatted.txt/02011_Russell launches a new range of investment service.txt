Russell launches a new range of investment services


Russell Investments has launched a range of services entitled Russell Enhanced Asset Allocation (EAA), which seeks to identify aberrant movements in the market and to find the means to invest in order to participate in these events in order to increase performance while controlling the risk and liquidity components of the investment. To develop its range, Russell has made use of projection models developed internally, which cover 11 geographical regions and 11 asset classes. These models are founded on the postulate that asset classes sometimes offer opportunities which may be leveraged by the investor. Currently, the EAA process aims to identify investment opportunities in 114 comparisons of pairs of asset classes.
