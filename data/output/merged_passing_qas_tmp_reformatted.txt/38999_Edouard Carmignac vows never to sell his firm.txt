Edouard Carmignac vows never to sell his firm


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In an interview with Financial News at the beginning of the month, Edouard Carmignac, who controls 70% of Carmignac Gestion, discusses the question of his succession. “I don’t intend to die at my desk,” he says. He favours an internal succession and would never like to have to sell his compamy. “An external institutional shareholder would destroy our culture,” he thinks. The obvious solution is to promote his daughter, Maxime. “The model I have in mind is Fidelity’s third generation. Not running the funds, but running the firm,” he adds.
