Benfica Stars Fund expecting EUR5m windfall


Real Madrid is in talks with S.L. Benfica to transfer the Portuguese player Fábio Coentrão from the BBVA Liga for the 2011-2012 season. If the two firms reach agreement about the EUR25m price tag, the Benfica Stars Fund will receive EUR5m, although the player was valued as of the end of May at only EUR2.27m, Funds People reports. The Benfica Stars Fund is a Portuguese special investment fund which holds the rights to 16 Portuguese footballers. The three most valuable are Oscar René Cardozo (EUR2.8m), Airton Ribeiro Santo, and Alan Kardec Junior (EUR2.43m each).
