Deutsche AWM, whose assets under management total about EUR1.160trn, is hoping to post profits this year of EUR1.7bn. The first quarter, however, ended with pre-tax profits of barely EUR300m. But the ambitions are there. “We want to become the European leader in asset and wealth management,” says Häger. Currently, Deutsche AWM holds fourth place in the European market. Deutsche AWM plans to build its presence in Asia, the United States and London, as well as in its wealth management activities. In Germany, Deutsche AWM is planning to develop its institutional activities.
