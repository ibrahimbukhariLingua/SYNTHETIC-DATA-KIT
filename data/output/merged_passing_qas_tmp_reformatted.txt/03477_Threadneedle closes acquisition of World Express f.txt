Threadneedle closes acquisition of World Express from StanChart


On Monday, Threadneedle announced that it had successfully completed the acqusition of World Express Funds, announced nearly four months ago (see Newsmanagers of 4 February). The vendor of the Luxembourg Sicav platform is Standard Chartered Bank (StanChart), which itself acquired the platform as part of its acquisition of the activities of American Express Bank.Assets in the Sicav as of 30 April totalled USD2.38bn. At the time the deal was announced, it was stated that as of the end of December, assets under management in World Express funds totalled USD2.7bn as of the end of December.Threadneedle views the operation as an opportunity to strengthen its presence in European and Asian markets, while StanChart says that it does not have any activities of this type, but that the World Express funds could quickly provide synergies and other benefits for a fund management firm. Threadneedle also becomes a strategic partner and preferred provider of services to StanChart funds.
