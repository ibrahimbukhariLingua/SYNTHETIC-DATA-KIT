United States - Tom Forester: a rising star


The Wall Street Journal reported on the reasons that Tom Forester, who has his own management firm, which manages a small diversified US equities fund with USD60m in assets, was the only manager to post positive returns in 2008 (0.4%), in a category that includes 2,800 funds. Most of the atypical manager’s secret consists in the face that he focuses on potential losses (downside). In addition, he did not hesitate to hold onto a 30% allocation to cash (he is currently 100% in cash), and he has no benchmark, which saved him from having to invest in the financial sector. Over five years, the S&P 500 has lost 19%, while Forester’s fund has earned 11%.
