ALFI calls for limited liability of depository


While welcoming the advances which the most recent proposals by the European Commission for UCITS fund regulations, the Luxembourg investment fund association (ALFI) on 4 July claimed in a statement that the level of liability of the depository needed to be clarified.Do depositories need to cover all categories of risk, including bankruptcy and fraud, for example? ALFI claims that although depositories are responsible for investment losses under all circumstances, they are becoming insurers for risks that they do not control. Such virtually total protection of the investor will have a cost, which will probably be borne by the final investor, according to the association, which cites moral hazard about conviction on the part of investors that their investment will be risk-free.Although responsibilities and duties are no longer shared by all participants in the mutual fund value chain, there may be a concentration of risk on a small number of depositories, and consequently a system with increased risk may develop.“Detailed talks are still necessary to ensure that the UCITS V directive strengthens the development of the UCITS brand, particularly in relation to terms governing the remuneration of managers and the sanctions regime,” says Camille Thommes, CEO of ALFI, in a statement.
