WisdomTree adds to ETF product range on London Stock Exchange


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The index-based fund provider WisdomTreee on Wednesday, 6 July announced the launch of a new ETF on the London stock exchange, the WisdomTree Eurozone Quality Dividend Growth Ucits ETF. The new product comes as an addition to its ETF range dedicated to growth of dividends, launched last month on the London stock exchange: WisdomTree US Quality Dividend Growth Ucits ETF and WisdomTree Global Quality Dividend Growth Ucits ETF. The new ETF is based on a methodology which places the emphasis on changes in dividend trends and concentrates on fundamental characteristics, in particular targeting businesses which offer growth in dividends. WisdomTree more specifically analyses expectations in terms of long-term profit growth, also combining “quality” factors to target additional earnings.
