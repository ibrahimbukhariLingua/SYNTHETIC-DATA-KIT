Danish pension fund ATP wonâ€™t accept French debt


ATP, the largest Danish pension fund (USD122bn), has announced that it has renegotiated its swap contracts, in order to avoid having to accept French government bonds as collateral, though these continue to have good ratings, according to the Bloomberg Risk Newsletter. The renegotiation also affects Italian bonds and bonds from other countries of Southern Europe. The fund will now only accept German, Danish and US government bonds.
