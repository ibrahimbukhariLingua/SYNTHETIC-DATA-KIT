Lyxor adds seven bond ETFs to physical replication range


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The ETF provider Lyxor Asset Management is adding to its physical replication range, adopting this mode of replication for seven UCITS ETFs which replicate EuroMTS Investment Grade indices. Lyxor thus strengthens its presence in two strategic priority areas: the development of its range of physical replication ETFs and of its bond offerings.“For each underlying index, Lyxor has defined the fund structure which optimises investment performance compared with the index,” a statement from Lyxor says.Each fund will invest directly in investment grade government bonds with varying maturities issued in the euro zone which constitute the respective EuroMTS Investment Grade Government indices, without the use of sampling techniques, in order to achieve the highest possible correlation with the performance of the index.The management process will exclude all securities lending operations, as these will not bring sufficient improvement in returns on investment to justify counterparty risks. Lyxor aims to offer clients the solution which offers the best risk/reward profile.
