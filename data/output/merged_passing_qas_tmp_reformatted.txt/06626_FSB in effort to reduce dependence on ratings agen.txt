FSB in effort to reduce dependence on ratings agencies


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The financial stability board (FSB) on 27 October published a series of “Principles for Reducing Reliance on Credit Rating Agency Ratings.” The objective of the principles laid out by the board is to reduce mechanical dependency on ratings, and to promote improvements in independent valuation of credit risk and means to undertake due diligence. The board emphasizes that the principles call for a significant modification to existing practices in five major areas: prudential supervision by banks, institutional investor policies, interventions by central banks, margin requirements for the private sector, and information requirements for securities issuers. The board admits, however, that the desires changes will not happen “from one day to the next.” It is desirable to maintain a transitional period, so that interested parties may put their own risk management capacities in place in the mid-term, and limit the influence of ratings agencies. The FSB proposes to issue an interim report on the progress made for the G20 during 2011.
