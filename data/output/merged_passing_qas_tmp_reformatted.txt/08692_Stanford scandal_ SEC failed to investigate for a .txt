Stanford scandal: SEC failed to investigate for a decade


The Securities and Exchange Commission suspected Texas financier R. Allen Stanford of running a Ponzi scheme as early as 1997 but took more than a decade to pursue him seriously, according to a report by the SEC’s inspector general cited by the Wall Street Journal. The report says SEC examiners concluded four times between 1997 and 2004 that Mr. Stanford’s businesses were fraudulent, but each time decided not to go further.
