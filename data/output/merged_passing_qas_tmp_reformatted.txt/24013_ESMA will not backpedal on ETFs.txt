ESMA will not backpedal on ETFs


“We will not backpedal. Progress towards stronger regulatory principles for ETFs is moving ahead. We just need to bring the various European regulations of the sector, which are moving in different directions, into line,” Vittorio Conti, chairman of the ESMA working group in charge of redefining the guidelines for ETFs, said in an interview with Plus24, the weekly money supplement of Il Sole – 244 Ore. “In order to guarantee regular and consistent coverage, the next step would be to verify the existence of financial products which have analogous structures and similar issues, such as ETN, ETC and certificates,” he added.
