Sarasin: Safra plans to cancel B-class shares and withdraw them from trading


B-class shares in Banque Sarain which are still in the hands of third parties following the firmâ€™s acquisition by Safra will be cancelled and withdrawn from public trading. Safra on 22 October petitioned the competent court in Basel to declare the remaining B-class shares in Sarasin null and void, the bank announced in a statement on 23 October. A request to withdraw Sarasin shares from listing on the SIX Swiss Exchange has also been submitted, the statement says. This withdrawal from listing would take place at the same time, or slightly after the shares would be declared null. Safra controls 99.47% of voting rights in Sarasin, following the recent finalisation of its takeover bid.
