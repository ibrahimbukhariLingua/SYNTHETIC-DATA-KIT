Swedbank Robur to absorb cost of external research


Swedbank Robur has decided to account for external research costs themselves when the MiFID II Directive enters into force on January 3, 2018. This means that costs will no longer be deducted from each fund. «The decision increases transparency for the 4.2 million savers who save in Swedbank Robur’s funds», said the Swedish bank. On January 3, 2018, the MiFID II Directive is introduced to strengthen consumer protection and increase the transparency of financial advisory services. The purpose of the new rules is to harmonize the regulation of the securities market."For us, it is an easy decision to take the external research costs ourselves. We are the fund company for the many savers and we want it to be clear to our customers what return on equity, what costs and what risks you can expect from saving in our funds, says Liza Jonson, CEO, Swedbank Robur.
