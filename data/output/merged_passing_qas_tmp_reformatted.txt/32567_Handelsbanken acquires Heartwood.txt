Handelsbanken acquires Heartwood


For an undisclosed amount, the Swedish firm Handelsbank is acquiring the wealth and asset management firm Heartwood Wealth Group (London and Tunbridge Wells), with assets totalling about SEK15bn, or GBP1.5bn. The transaction is pending clearance by the British FSA. Anders Bouvin, CEO of Handelsbanken UK, emphasized in a statement that the group already has 147 branches in the United Kingdom, the market in which the Swedish firm is experiencing its greatest growth. The transaction was approved in advance by a majority of shareholders in Heartwood, and Simon Lough, CEO, will continue to lead the firm after it becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of Handelsbanken.
