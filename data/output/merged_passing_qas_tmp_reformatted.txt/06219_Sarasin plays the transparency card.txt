Sarasin plays the transparency card


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Sarasin bank last August pledged no longer to manage undeclared assets until 2012. In an interview with Agefi Switzerland, Bas Rijke, head of the Geneva branch of Sarasin since 1 August this year, explains that the vast majority of clients would like to comply with the law, even if that takes more or less time, depending on their personal situation or their country of residence. “The question of the status of their assets is often raised by clients, and we inform them about it, advising them to get their fiscal structure examined by specialists, in order to ensure that it is in compliance with legislation in their country, particularly in the case of decease or inheritance,” he explains. If a client refuses to come into compliance, the bank will clearly inform the client that it has no intention of engaging in illegal activities. “The results show that our policy does not hold back growth. Sarasin attracted CHF6.4bn in net new money in first half 2010, largely from European clients through a transparent process,” says Rijke.
