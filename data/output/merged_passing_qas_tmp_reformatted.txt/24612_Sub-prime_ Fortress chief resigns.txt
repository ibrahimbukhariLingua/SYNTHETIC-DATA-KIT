Sub-prime: Fortress chief resigns


Daniel Mudd, CEO of the hedge fund management firm Fortress Investment Group, resigned on Teusday from his position on the board and from the firm, slightly over one month after the SEC filed civil charges against him for securities fraud, the Wall Street Journal reports. Mudd has been accused of fraud during his time as CEO of Fannie Mae (a position from which he was ousted in September 2008), and of failing to accurately disclose risks that the government-backed mortgage lender bore on the sub-prime mortgage markets. Fortress (USD43.6bn in assets as of the end of September) says that Randal Nardone, one of the co-founders of the firm, will continue to serve as interim CEO, which he has done since Mudd began a leave of absence in December.
