Man Group recruits a former pension fund CIO


The British alternative management group Man has recruited Judy Sanders as senior adviser in its British institutional unit, Investment Europe reports. Sanders previously spent seven years as chief investment officer for the public pension fund for the West Midlands, whose assets under management total GBP8.7bn. The recruitment is motivated, at least in part, by a growing interest on the part of institutional investors in alternative management. Between 2009 and 2011, allocations by British pension funds to hedge funds increased from 1.8% to 4.1%, according to statistics from the national pension fund association. And a recent survey by SEI found that 38% of institutionals were planning to increase their investments in hedge funds, more than twice as many as were planning to reduce their exposure. While employed at the West Midlands pension fund, Saunders developed an allocation dedicated to alternative investments, up to 35%, of which 10% was allocated to absolute return strategies.
