Credit Suisse goes into alternative management business in Japan


Agefi Switzerland reports that Credit Suisse Securities (Japan) on 2 October received a license from the Japanese market surveillance authorities to operate as an investment firm. This authorization follows the recruitment in August of Shinichiro Sato, from BlackRock, who will lead a team of six people. This represents a “strange strategic reorientation,” the newspaper comments, pointing out that at the end of 2008, Credit Suisse sold its “Global Investors” asset management division to Aberdeen Asset Management in exchange for a 24.5% stake in the enlarged capital of the British wealth management firm. But Credit Suisse is seeking to develop its alternative management activities in order to attract the savings of Japanese pensioners, which total nearly CHF800bn. This represents a considerable challenge, as Japanese pension funds are increasingly inclined to invest in alternative assets, including hedge funds and private equity.
