Bonuses: UK managers would be hit hardest in Europe by far


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } If remuneration rules passed by the monetary affairs committee (ECON) of the European Parliament on 21 March were applied as they are to managers of UCITS-compliant mutual funds, UK asset management firms would be disproportionately affected by rules limiting bonuses, as bonuses at these firms tend to represent a larger percentage of remuneration, says Jon Terry, a partner in the reward team at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).The specialist claims that many British asset management firms would be obliged to completely overhaul the way in which they pay their fund managers and management personnel, due to the large proportion of remuneration which would be affected by the new rules. In fact, says Terry, asset management firms are said to be concerned by the fact that the monetary affairs commission is proposing a much more explicit definition of the individuals subject to the rules than the one which is applicable to banks or hedge fund managers. If the proposals are passed in their initial form, it would significantly increase the number of people affected by the new rules in senior management, as well as front, middle and back offices.
