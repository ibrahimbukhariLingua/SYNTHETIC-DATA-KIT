UK wants to be more competitive with European funds


The Investment Management Association (IMA) is calling on the UK government to make two practical changes which could help improve the competitiveness of the UK funds industry, in its representations for the 2010 Budget. The abolition of stamp duty on funds would enable the UK to compete on equal terms with other EU countries The introduction of a new type of fund structure called a ‘contractual fund’ would bring new opportunities for UK fund managers and investors. Richard Saunders, chief executive of the IMA, said: «This will allow the UK to compete effectively when the new UCITS IV Directive comes into force. It would give out a strong signal that the UK is serious about providing cross border funds - and would deter business from going to other EU countries». He adds: The UK asset management industry is in a strong position to attract new business, as it has the skills and resources to do so. For every GBP1 billion of funds that domicile abroad, we stand to lose around GBP720,000 in employment and corporation taxes. These two changes would both prevent further losses and provide further opportunities.»
