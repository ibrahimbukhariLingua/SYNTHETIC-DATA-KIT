Activist Bill Ackman calls Herbalife a “Ponzi scheme”


The Pershing Square fund, founded by Bill Ackman, claims that the Herbalife company has set up a massive pyramid scheme for a US business, Les Echos reports. Ackman says the firm pays independent networks of distributors who sell its product by recruiting vendors in turn. This is a variation of the Madoff case, but in the dietary supplement market. The fund claims that the group releases falsified figures about its sales and profits. Ackman has a short position on the shares, which have lost half of their value over the past 10 days.
