CalSTRS makes a good sale in Manhattan


The California pension fund CalSTRS has been through a difficult period on the Manhattan real estate market. But it has just made a comfortable gain from a sale of its 65% stake in the Equitable Building (120 Broadway) for UDS341m to UBS Realty Investors, the Wall Street Journal reports. The stake was bought for USD240m in 2004.
