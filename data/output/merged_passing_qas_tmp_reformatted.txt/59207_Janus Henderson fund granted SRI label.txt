Janus Henderson fund granted SRI label


Janus Henderson Investors on 4 September announced that it has obtained a socially responsible investment (SRI) label for its Henderson Global Care Growth fund, managed by Hamish Chamberlayne. “The label, obtained early this summer, comes as a sign of the desire of Janus Hendreson to be one of the financial players in socially responsible investment in the French financial marketplace,” the asset management firm says. The Henderson Global Care Growth fund, launched in 1992, invests in publicly-traded funds worldwide which deliver concrete responses to four major challenges: climate change, demographic growth, managing natural resources, and lastly, ageing population. The vehicle, whose portfolio is composed of 60 to 80 stocks, manages over EUR600m in assets for institutional and retail clients. Janus Henderson Investors claims in its statement to be the first foreign asset management firm in France to receive an SRI label for one of its funds.
