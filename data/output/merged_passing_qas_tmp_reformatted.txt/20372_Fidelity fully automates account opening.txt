Fidelity fully automates account opening


With the new verify-U service, Fidelity Worldwide Investments is now offering investors in Germany a way to open an account without having to go to a post office to verify their personal information. The verify-U system developed by the cybits company allows potential clients to sign up online at fidelity-direkt.de, providing a mobile phone number, an email address, some information from their identity card, and where applicable, bank account information. Fidelity claims it is the first asset management firm to offer such a service in Germany.Accounts of German clients of Fidelity are held at FFB (FIL Fondsbank), which was acquired by Fidelity in October 2009. FFB provides account maintenance for about 8,000 funds from about 200 asset managers, in addition to those from Fidelity.
