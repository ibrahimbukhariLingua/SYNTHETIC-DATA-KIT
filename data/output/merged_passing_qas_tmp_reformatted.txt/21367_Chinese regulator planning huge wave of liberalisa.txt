Chinese regulator planning huge wave of liberalisation


The Chinese securities commission (CSRC) has announced that it is planning to liberalise access to Qualified Foreign Institutional Investment (QFII) licenses, which would involve lowering the required operational experience for insurance companies and pension funds with long-term investment plans from five years to two years. According to Z-Ben Advisors, the CSRC is also said to be planning to extend eligibility to the inter-bank bond market, index futures and margin trading.The regulator is also planning to relax the requirements for mutual fund sales licenses; it is planning to restitute sales licenses previously issued to certain firms which no longer are licensed due to administrative sanctions against them in the past three years.The CSRC is planning to launch a consultation with professionals in the sector on reforms to regulations applicable to fund management firms: it is hoping to incite managers to launch more fixed income products, in order to increase the proportion of total assets in the industry in these funds to 50%.
