CRM stake in Deutsche Bank “mechanically” exceeds 3% threshold


Deutsche Bank on Monday announced in an ad-hoc filing that Capital Research and Management (CRM) notified it on 7 January that it held over 3% of its capital, and now controls 3.53%. However, the German bank states, the fact that the investor has passed the 3% threshold is merely due to the mechanical effect of a reshuffle of Deutsche Bank shares between various CRM funds.
