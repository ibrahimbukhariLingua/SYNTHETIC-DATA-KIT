John Paulson defends hedge funds


In an interview with Les Echos, John Paulson, president, CEO and founder of Paulson & Co, responds to criticisms as to the excessive size of hedge funds. “I don’t see any reason to be concerned about our size or our excessive influence,” says Paulson. With USD36bn in assets, “we are 100 times smaller than BlackRock, which manages USD3trn. We are very small in terms of asset management.” He also claims that US financial reforms are “largely precipitated by an emotional reaction. The result is that they create many conflicts and uncertainties. Like Alan Greenspan, I think that they will create market distortions. The European approach, based on Basel III, is far better and more flexible.”
