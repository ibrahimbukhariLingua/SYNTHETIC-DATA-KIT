Independent management firms gain ground


In the United Kingdom, banks and insurers are losing market share in asset management to independent boutiques, Financial Times FM reports. Last year, for the first time, assets under management at the major groups and their affiliates fell to less than half of total assets, according to statistics from the Investment Management Association. In 2009, assets under management in the United Kingdom by independent management firms represented 35.2%, compared with only 12% in 2003.
