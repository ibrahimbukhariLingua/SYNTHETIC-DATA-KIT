Emerging markets hedge funds up strongly in 2009


Hedge funds invested in emerging markets have offset their significant losses in 2008, and made significant progress last year, according to statistics from Hedge Fund Research. The HFRI Emerging Markets Index gained 40.4% for the year as a whole. Assets invested in emerging markets last year rose by USD25bn to over USD93bn, while gains related to positive market effects of USD34.4bn generously compensated for outflows of USD8.5bn. Funds dedicated to emerging markets finished the year with ten consecutive months of gains, though January 2010 brought a dip of -1.24% largely due to concerns over government debt risks.
