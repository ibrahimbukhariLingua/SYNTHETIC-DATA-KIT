Norwegian sovereign fund appoints CIOs for real estate in Europe and United States


The Norwegian sovereign fund has created two positions for chief investment officers (CIO) for real estate in Europe and the United States. Per Løken and Romain Veber have been promoted to direct real estate investments on the two sides of the Atlantic. Løken, who joined Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) in 2011 and has focused largely on British real estate, becomes CIO for the United States. Veber, who also joined NBIM in 2011 and had directed the real estate activities of the sovereign fund in Paris, becomes chief investment officer for Europe.The two appointments reflect the growing exposure of the sovereign fund to real estate, as it plans to increase the proportion of this asset class in its portfolio. At the end of 2016, the investments of the sovereign fund in real estate were at nearly the same level in the two regions. They totalled about EUR8.4bn both in North America and Europe.
