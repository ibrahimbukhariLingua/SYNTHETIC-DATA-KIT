Multi-strategy firms will do well


Multi-strategy asset management businesses, offering both alternative and traditional investments, are likely to emerge as the most successful type of firm, according to half of 150 investment professionals and pension professionals in the United Kingdom and Europe interviewed by Penrose. 32% of respondents think that specialised boutiques will perform best. Only 13% believe that traditional long-only asset managers will do best. Meanwhile 68% of these respondents estimate that the era of star fund managers is not over, and that a fund manager with a proven track record is still a huge draw for the investors. 26%, however, think that investors are no longer investing in funds based solely on the profile on one fund manager, but pay more attention to risk management and costs. As to the outlooks for hedge funds, 47% of professionals surveyed by Penrose estimate that the regulatory crackdown will drastically reduce the number of funds in operation. But 39% still believe that they will make a comeback and that performance will improve. 74% think that investors in pension funds will follow the example of USS and increase their exposure to hedge funds and other alternative asset classes. In the area of ETFs, opinions are more divided. 48% of respondents believe that these products will remain for sophisticated investors and that they will always represent a small part of assets under management in the asset management industry. On the other hand, 45% think that ETFs will rival the mainstream funds. Regarding the impact of UCITS IV, 41% estimate that two years will be necessary before the impact of the regulation is felt, and that its impact will be smaller than that of UCITS III. 27% estimate that the regulations will make it possible to make savings due to economies of scale and cost reductions. Only 11% think that this will improve the efficiency of the market.
