AmLeague: November was a good month for stock-pickers


The good performance of equity markets in the month of November made the markets hard to beat, particularly in the euro zone. Stock-pickers were able nonetheless to stand out, and to post considerably higher growth than the indices for the month. However, systematic and quantitative management suffered.In the euro category of the amLeague contest, seven portfolios out of 18 managed to outperform the Eurostoxx net return index (+2.78%). Dexia AM, Ecofi Investissements and Mandarine Gestion gained 4.45%, 4.29% and 4.08%, respectively. Over an observation period of three months, these asset management firms were logically characterised by their overexposure to the market (with beta equal to or higher than one) and stock picks which paid off (with positive alpha).At the bottom of the rankings, quantitative asset management firms showed the opposite characteristics: low exposure to the market and stock picks that cost them: Swiss Life AM and Tobam gained only 1.65% an 1.54%, respectively, while in last place, ING IM is the only portfolio to have made losses (-0.20%), as stock-picking had a significant negative impact.In the Europe category, the situation is largely similar. Overexposure to the market and positive stock picks at the top of the rankings helped the best. Dexia AM, Sycomore AM and Edmond de Rothschild AM (Edram) take the top three spots for November, with respective gains of 5.78%, 3.80% and 3.70%. They are among the 12 portfolios out of 20 which did better than the benchmark, the Stoxx 600 net return (+2.19%).Lastly, in the Global Equities category, six portfolios out of 13 outperformed the Stoxx 180 net return (+0.87%). Active management stood out, with the top three finishes Edram (+2.30%), Efoci Investissements (+2.18%) and AllianzGI High Alpha Strategy (1.40%). Edram also stands out at the top of the rankings with an underexposure to the market over the past three months (0.7). However, stock picks were also highly positive. At the bottom of the rankings, quantitative management at Swiss Life AM (-0.13%), Theam (-0.38%) and Tobam (-0.40%) also had a net underexposure, but over three months, their stock picks were negative.
