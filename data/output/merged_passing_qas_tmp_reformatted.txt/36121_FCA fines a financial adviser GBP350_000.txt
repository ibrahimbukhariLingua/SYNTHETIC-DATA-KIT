Craig Cameron, head of the consulting firm Burlington Associates, based in London, participated in creating three high-risk products in 2005 which offered investment in real estate in Croatia, Bulgaria and Montenegro. These products, reserved by definition to qualified clisnts, were distributed to retail clients without prior verification that these investors are eligible for such vehicles. More than 800 clients invested about GBP30m in threee UCIS funds which did not deliver the expected results.
