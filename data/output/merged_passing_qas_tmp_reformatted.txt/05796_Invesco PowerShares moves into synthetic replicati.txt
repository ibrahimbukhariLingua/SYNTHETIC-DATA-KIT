Invesco PowerShares moves into synthetic replication


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Invesco PowerShares announced on Tuesday, 7 December, that it is planning to extend its range of ETFs in Europe with the development of expertise in the area of swaps. These will allow the management firm to reproduce indices which cannot be replicated with the usual physical replication methods. As a part of this project, two physical replication ETFs based on emerging markets will be converted into synthetic replication ETFs: PowerShares Middle East North Africa NASDAQ OMX Fund (listed in France and Italy) PowerShares FTSE RAFI Emerging Markets Fund (listed in Italy, France, Germany, and Switzerland). From 5 January 2011, the two ETFs will be in a position to use derivative instruments, and will reproduce the total returns of the benchmark index solely through derivatives, which means by using over-the-counter swaps rather than directly acquiring the shares in the index, a statement says. The modifications will generate cost savings and improve the replication of the indices. As derivative instruments guarantee a total return equivalent to that of their benchmark index, the synthetic replication funds will be in a better position to post returns similar to their indices. The maximal annual management commission for each synthetic replication fund will be reduced, from 0.955 to 0.75% for the PowerShares Middle East North Africa NASDAQ OMX Fund, and from 0.85% to 0.65% for the PowerShares FTSE RAFI Emerging Markets Fund.
