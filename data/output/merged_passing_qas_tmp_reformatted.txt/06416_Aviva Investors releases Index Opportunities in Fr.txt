Aviva Investors releases Index Opportunities in France, Germany and UK


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The British management firm Aviva Investors has been granted a sales license in France, Germany and the United Kingdom for the UCITS-compliant absolute return fund Index Opportunities, managed by Iyad Farah and Ned Kelly, assisted by a team of seven managers and analysts, which follows up to 25 indices of Europe, North America, the Asia-Pacific region and emerging markets. The objective is to profit from inefficiencies and distortions related to the rebalancing of indices and therefore of passively-managed funds. This involves long positions on equities entering the indices and short positions on outgoing businesses. The fund, which was launched on 23 April, aims for returns 500 basis points higher than the Euribor 1 month, with ex ante volatility of less than 7.5%.
