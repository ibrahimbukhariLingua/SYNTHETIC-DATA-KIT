Bonds drive market in early September


With the European Central Bank resolved to maintain the status quo and an outlook for US interest rates to remain at their current levels for some time to come, the bond asset class has been subject to further favorable weather. In the week to 7 September, bond funds overall posted net inflows of slightly over USD6bn, according to statistics from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, based on data from the flow monitoring data specialist EPFR Global. Funds specialised in emerging market debt posted positive inflows again last week, while funds dedicated to corporate debt continued to post subscriptions, totalling USD6.8bn, both for investment grade debt and for the high yield sector. Despite a rebound in appetite for the asset class over the past few weeks, funds investing in equities did not see inflows in early September. The bottom line for the week comes in at slightly over USD200m. Positive inflows to emerging market equity funds were doubled compared with the previous week. However, funds dedicated to European and US equities finished the week with net outflows of over USD1bn each.
