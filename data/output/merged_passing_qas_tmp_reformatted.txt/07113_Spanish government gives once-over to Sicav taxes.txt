Spanish government gives once-over to Sicav taxes


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } On Friday, the Spanish cabinet announced that capital reductions by Sicav funds, the preferred means used by Spanish high net worth families to extract liquidity at a tax rate of only 1%, the same as for investment funds, will be taxed as capital gains, at 19% up to EUR6,000, and 21% above that threshold. Cotizalia reports that the move is included in the draft budget for 2010. The finance minister says the change will apply to all Sicav funds, regardless of their country of domicile. In other words, it will not help to move Sicavs to Luxembourg or Malta, as many specialists are recommending.
