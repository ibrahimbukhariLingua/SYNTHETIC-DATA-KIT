Hennessee index posts strongest gains in nine months


Hennessee Group has announced that its hedge fund index gained 5.68% in May, its best performance since February 2000, the Wall Street Journal reports. Last month, hedge funds outperformed equities, thanks to a continued rising trend in the price of certain commodities. Gains in May were largely driven by arbitrage strategies, but long/short equity funds, which have lowered their levels of exposure, also performed well. Charles Gradante, co-founder of Hennessee, estimates that the end of a 20-year rising cycle on bonds may now be forthcoming.
