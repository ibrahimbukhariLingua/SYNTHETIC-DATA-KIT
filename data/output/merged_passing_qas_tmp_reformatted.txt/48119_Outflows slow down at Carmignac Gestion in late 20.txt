Outflows slow down at Carmignac Gestion in late 2014


At the end of 2014, Carmignac Gestion had assets of EUR50.3bn, thanks to a market effect of EUR3.4bn, which partly offset net outflows of about EUR6.4bn last year. “But above all,” says Didier Saint-Georges, managing director, in an interview with Newsmanagers, “outflows were stopped in second half, as the EUR6.4bn were more or less all lost in the first six months.”Another satisfactory point is that Carmignac Patrimoine, the flagship fund of the range, has returned to gains. Last year, the fund, with has EUR25bn in assets, after outflows of EUR4.3bn last year, posted returns of +8.81%. This result may help to forget the disappointment of 2013 (+3.53%), the cause of the outflows in 2014.In terms of business development, the firm plans to continue its conquest in foreign lands. Some countries show a very good dynamic of inflows. Carmignac Gestion, which does not communicate figures country by country, says it had good results in Belgium and Spain. In the United Kingdom, the firm has also beel ploughing the furrow: “our funds have been detected on the ‘radar screens’ of investors on the major platforms we have identified. As a result, our reputation is growing and inflows are rising gradually,” says Saint-Georges.Lastly, Germany and Switzerland are two countries in which Carmignac Gestion has market shares which remain modest, and where, as a result, “the growth margin is higher.” France, without much surprise, ranks alongside Italy as one of the disappointments of 2014.The French asset management firm is not planning to limit itself to Europe. Over a longer term, it would like to harvest the fruit of the prospecting it is currently carrying out in Latin America and Asia. “Growth in the next five years will be strong and, as such, our market share is weak there,” says Saint Georges.
