Sovereign fund gives itself time to consider investing in new asset classes


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Norwegian sovereign fund, whose assets under management total about USD860bn, is not yet ready to commit to new asset classes, and is taking a year to study opportunities to invest in infrastructure or non-publicly traded assets, finance minister Siv Jansen told a group of journalists on 7 April, the news agency Reuters reports. The fund will first have to evaluate its allocation to real estate, which is still very modest, but which is rising steadily. “We are in a period of apprenticeship with our allocation to real estate, and we are currently discussing an extension into non-publicly traded,” says Jensen. But the sovereign fund clearly has no intention of extending its investment spectrum this year, as some specialists had supposed. 2014 will be primarily a time to think. “If we extend our active portfolio, it will be logical to discuss infrastructure as well as other categories... We will discuss the topic again next year,” says Jansen.
