Wells Fargo Advantage concludes absorption of Evergreen


As announced earlier this year (see Newsmanagers of 15 January), Wells Fargo has now completed the process of adjusting its range following the merger of the management firm Wells Fargo Advantage Funds with Evergreen Funds, the management firm from Wachovia. As of 31 May, assets in the new family of products, which includes 132 open-end and closed-end mutual funds as well as variable trust funds (and excluding offshore funds), totalled USD224.1bn. The integration of Evergreen has meant the reconditioning of 27 Evergreen funds as Wells Fargo Advantage funds, and the merger of 53 mutual funds from the two product ranges.
