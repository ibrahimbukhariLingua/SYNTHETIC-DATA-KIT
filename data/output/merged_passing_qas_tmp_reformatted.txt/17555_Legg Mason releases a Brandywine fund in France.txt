Legg Mason releases a Brandywine fund in France


Following Germany, where the product has recently received a license from BaFin (see Newsmanagers of 11 December), Legg Mason will be releasing the Irish-registered bond fund Brandywine Global Opportunistic Fixed Income (IE00B3V5M979), managed by David Hoffman.Vincent Passa, director of distribution for Legg Mason in France, says the product “appears particularly appropriate for an environment of low returns on government debt, due to its ability to invest in private issues or MBS.”Brandywine is a specialist in bond markets, with about USD30bn in assets under management with no benchmark.
