Intech IM (Janus) launches a passive alternative strategy


Intech Investment Management, an asset manager belonging to the Janus Group, has announced the launch of its Alpha Capture Index strategy, a passive alternative to capitalization-weighted indexing. Intechâ€™s research demonstrates that over the long term its Alpha Capture Index has the potential to provide a performance advantage when compared to a market-capitalization-weighted index, and is more stable than an equal-weighted portfolio. This passive alternative essentially combines an equal-weighted index and a cap-weighted index using a patented investment process and incorporating proprietary trading innovations. The result is a portfolio combination that is more efficient than either index independently. The Intech Alpha Capture Index strategy seeks to generate approximately 50-to-60 basis points of excess return annualized over the cap-weighted index gross of fees, to have low portfolio turnover (approximately 8% per year over the long term), to have low implementation costs and fees, and a tracking error of approximately 1.5% to 2.0% per year gross of fees over the long term to the capitalization-weighted alternative. Currently, the strategy can be managed against three benchmarks: the S&P 500 Index, Russell 1000 Index, and MSCI World Index.
