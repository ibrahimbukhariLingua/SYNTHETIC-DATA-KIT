Lyxor AM launches an ETF investing in floating rate notes


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Lyxor on 10 February announced the launch of an ETF investing in floating rate notes (FRN), “to offer an alternative short-term investment solution, with returns higher than the Euribor 3-month,” a statement says. The ETF aims to replicate the Barclays Euro Corporate FRN 0-7Y Enhanced Duration, composed of floating rate notes which deliver a credit risk premium paid by issuing companies on a range of maturity dates from 0 to 7 years, while benefiting from low sensitivity to an increase in long-term rates. The index has a 50% weighting for 0-3 year issues and for 3-7 year issues respectively. The advantage of this allocation is to overweight 3-7 year issues, with the objective of obtaining higher returns than the variable rate bond indices currently available on the market, a statement says. As of 31 January 2015, the returns at maturity of the Barclays Euro Corporate FRN 0-7Y Enhanced Duration index was Euribor 3 month + 0.33%.
