Banif Inmobiliario loses more than EUR300m for its subscribers


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Investors with shares in the real estate fund Santander Banif Inmobiliario can hope to get their money back in March 2011, but they could have done better, Expansión reports. The 43,500 shareholders in the fund, whose redemptions have been frozen since March 2009, have lost 11% of their money since then, for a total of EUR309m. In addition to these losses come the fund’s losses on sales of assets between early 2009 and the present, with significant markdowns on expert valuations. At this pace, Banif Inmobiliario would be liquidated for EUR2.45bn, compared with EUR2.52bn currently, of which EUR2.38bn are held by outside subscribers. According to sources close to Santander, about 31,000 of the 43,500 current shareholders in the fund will have earned a profit nonetheless. The net asset value of the fund, founded in 1995, is currently at its lowest level since 2005.
