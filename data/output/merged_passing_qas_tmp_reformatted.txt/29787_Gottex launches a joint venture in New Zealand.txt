Gottex launches a joint venture in New Zealand


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The alternative asset management firm Gottex has founded a joint venture with the New Zealand firm Staples Rodway Asset Management Ltd (SRAM). The joint venture will be active in New Zealand under the name Gottex AR Funds Ltd (GSRF) and will offer multi-asset investment products to New Zealand investors seeking diversified international investment exposure, Gottex announced in a statement on May 30. Guy Holroyd is the managing director of GSRF, and the existing SRF International Capital Growth Fund, established in 2011, is being folded into the joint venture and rebranded as the Gottex SR Multi-Asset Global Fund. Bill Landes, senior managing director and CIO of Gottex Multi Asset business, will be closely involved in the management of the fund. The creation of the entity represents a further step in the development strategy of Gottex in Asia, and follows the announcement earlier in May of a new partnership with Astmax in Japan. SRAM is part of the Stables Rodway group, an association of six independent accounting firms through New Zealand, providing businesses and individuals with accounting advice and business related services. As of 31 March 2013, assets under management by Gottex totalled USD6.4bn.
