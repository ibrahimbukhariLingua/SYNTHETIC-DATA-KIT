Banks reorganise fund management activities


As elsewhere in Europe, Spanish banks are planning to sell off or reshuffle their fund management activities, Cinco DÃ­as reports. For the moment, the only firm to have announced that it would like to sell its asset management unit is Santander, but the sale has not taken place, since the bank is asking EUR3bn, which is too much, and because some of the potential buyers are suffering due to the crisis. Meanwhile, Santander Asset Management has cut back the number of funds in its range by 10% since the end of 2007, and it is now beginning to merge funds which use the same strategies at different fee levels, depending on whether they are sold by Santander, Banesto or Banif. Sabadell, for its part, is reducing the number of its funds to 87 from 100, and has created a new affiliate, BanSabadell Securities Services, to manage the entire securities services process; the firm may provide securities services to other management firms also. Caixa Tarragona has opted for another solution, by outsourcing management of its funds (to Intermoney Valores), while continuing to offer its products and receiving the commissions for them.
