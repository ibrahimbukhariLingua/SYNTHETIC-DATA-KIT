Real estate managers fear valuation of their assets


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } In a survey by Preqin, 49% of 191 private equity managers specialised in real estate indicated that the valuation of the real estate assets held in their portfolios was the main source of concern for them. Half of respondents also say they are concerned by increasingly strong competition for purchase of assets, and 58% say that it has become more difficult to find good real estate properties, compared with last year, Preqin states. The price of assets is tending to rise, 63% of processionals surveyed say. In light of these difficult conditions, real estate private equity fund managers are revising their projections for returns downward (51%). This percentage rises to 69% for funds with USD500m to USD990m in assets under management, while 53% of funds with over USD1bn are maintaining or increasing their performance projections.
