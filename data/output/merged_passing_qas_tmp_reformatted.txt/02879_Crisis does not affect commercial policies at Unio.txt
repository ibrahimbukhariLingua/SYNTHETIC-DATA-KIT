Crisis does not affect commercial policies at Union Investment


Union Investment estimates that its fee policies are not put in question by the crisis as the fees it charges are lower than those of the industry as a whole. Its TER totals only 1.39% for equities funds, while for management firms overall the average is 1.75%. The same goes for bond funds, for which the TER at Union averages only 0.89%, compared with 1.09% for the industry as a whole.Rüdiger Ginsberg, chairman of the managing board at Union Asset Management Holding, on Monday announced that the asset management firm for the German co-operative banks did not need to extend its product range, which in Germany consists of only 163 open-ended funds. In addition, he says, 79% of these funds have assets of over EUR50m.Lastly, Ginsberg states that Union does not need to reduce its personnel. On the contrary, the management firm has made targeted recruitments in the past few months, with the objective of having “the most complete staff possible when business jumpstarts again.”
