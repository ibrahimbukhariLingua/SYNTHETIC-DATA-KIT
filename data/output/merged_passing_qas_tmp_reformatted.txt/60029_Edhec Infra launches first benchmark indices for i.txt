Edhec Infra launches first benchmark indices for infrastructure


After more than three years of research the Edhec Infrastructure Institute-Singapore (Edhec Infra) department in early June launched a first series of 384 performance indices related to investments in infrastructure debt and equity, Agefi Hebdo reports on 13 July. According to the newspaper, the objective is to improve the way in which investors measure the performance of their investments infrastructure, and currently allocate over USD1trn to these segments. The work was one of the cornerstones in the creation of the association of long-term infrastructure investors (Association des investisseurs d’infrastructures à long terme, LTIIA).
