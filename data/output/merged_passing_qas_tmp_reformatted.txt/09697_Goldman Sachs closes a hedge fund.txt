Goldman Sachs closes a hedge fund


Overnight between Friday and Saturday, Goldman Sachs announced the closure of its quantitative hedge fund Global Equity Opportunities (GEO), which saw heavy redemptions, and which managed only USD200m as of the end of 2009, compared with a peak of about USD7bn a few years ago, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. The Wall Street Journal adds that Goldman Sachs says it has no plans to pull out of the hedge fund sector. On Thursday, the bank stated that of USD871bn in assets, about USD146bn are in alternative investments, including hedge funds and funds of hedge funds managed by its quantitative team.
