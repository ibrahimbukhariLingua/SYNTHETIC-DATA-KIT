US pension funds sue depositories for price-fixing


US pension funds are accusing their providers, BNY Mellon and State Street, of considerably overcharging them over the past few years, and are seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in restitution, Les Echos reports. Some of the current legal actions began in October 2009, as institutional investors resolved to take back control of costs after the crisis. As a result, the major depository banks began to heavily slash their prices for currency trades in 2010, by more than 63% compared with the previous years, according to “Pensions and Investments.”
