Towers Watson calls on institutionals to revise their equity strategies


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Institutional investors are expected to revise their approach with respect the construction of their equity portfolios, in order to benefit from innovations in the sector, according to an article in the new publication “Equity Investing: Insights into a better portfolio.” The article emphasizes that the bricks used to build an equity portfolio are no longer limited to active and passive management, with weighted indices according to cap size. Now a third pillar needs to be aded: smart beta, which aims for systematic factors or thematic investment to capture specific premiums, generally at a very low cost. “Developments on the equity markets and in the sector have added complexity and depth, in terms of products available and portfolio construction tools. It is not enough to get an allocation to earn beta and one or two active managers to construct an equity portfolio. The asset-holder now faces the challenge of developing his own portfolio construction tools, or to delegate this task to third parties,” says Jim MacLachlan, global head of equity research at Towers Watson. Institutionals need to become adept in manager selection and portfolio construction, in order to identify qualified asset managers from a universe that includes thousands of competing products. A basic principle is to ensure that managers are “best in class” and offer specific strategies which cann’t be replicated elsewhere at low cost. Institutionals may introduce new cost-benefit criteria, for example by putting place a long/short portfolio in paralle with a long-only strategy, or developing more activist strategies.
