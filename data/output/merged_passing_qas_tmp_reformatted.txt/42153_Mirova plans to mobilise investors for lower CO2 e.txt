Mirova plans to mobilise investors for lower CO2 emissions


A few weeks from the United Nations conference on climate change (Cop 21) in Paris, Mirova, an asset management firm dedicated to socially responsible investment affiliated to Natixis Asset Management, has published a report “Investing for a low-Carbon economy” (attached). Philippe Zaouati, CEO of Mirova, and his team took the occasion to present “a panorama of our understanding of the challenges of climate change, the investment solutions on financial marktes which we have identified, and lastly, the tools we have to measure the impact of our actions,” he said at a presentation on Tuesday in Paris.From its creation in January 2014, Mirova has been built on an ambition to integrate the challenges of sustainable development within the heart of its investment processes. With this new study, the asset management firm wishes for investors also to become “Cop 21 actors,” Zaouati says. To achieve the objectives of the climate change conference, which are to limit global warming to 2 degrees over pre-industrial levels, “it is indispensable to reorient savings towards companies and projects which are favourable to the energy transition,” which can only occur if we manage to mobilize the savings of private investors.”One of the main topics of the study is measurement of carbon footprints. As the use of relevant tools to determine the carbon footprint is “essential” and “an indispensable step in the construction of portfolios which contribute to the energy transition,” says Mirova, the asset management firm is using a new methodology which it has created to measure the carbon impact of investment portfolios. This was created in partnership with Carbone 4, a consulting firm specialised in carbon strategy, and makes it possible to evaluate the contribution of businesses to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.The French asset management firm places three products of its range at the heart of “decarbonising” the economy. For these products, Mirova has applied to be granted a new energy and climate transition (TEC) label.The first of these, Mirova Eurofideme 3, invests in infrastructure for renewable energies, and “benefits from a particularly favourable political context,” says Raphaël Lance, director of renewable energy funds at Mirova. European countries have set an objective of 27% renewable energies by 2030.The second product highlighted, the Mirova Global Transition Energy Equity Fund, invests in businesses worldwide whose products or services aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Lastly, in the category of green bond funds, the Mirova Green Bond – Global fund invests in projects which present environmental benefits, while earning returns similar to those of traditional bonds.As of the end of September, Mirova had EUR5.9bn in assets under management, and had posted net subscriptions of EUR837.3m in the first nine months of the year.
