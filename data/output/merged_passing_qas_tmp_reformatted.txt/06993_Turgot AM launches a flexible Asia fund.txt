Turgot AM launches a flexible Asia fund


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Turgot Asset Management has announced the launch of Turgot Asie Flexible, a flexible fund which invests in large caps of the entire Asia Pacific region (China, India, Japan, South-East Asia, Australia), with no country weighting requirements. Waldemar Brun-Themin, manager of the fund, will avoid countries which present risks such as political instability, deflation, or excessive indebtedness. He may reduce exposure to equities to 0%, through the use of coverage with derivative instruments, in order to preserve the fundâ€™s returns in periods of heavy market decline. At the other extreme, exposure may be increased to 130% to benefit from rising markets. Turgot Asie Flexible will concentrate on three investment themes: returns (dividends, cash flow, etc.), the emergence of consumer markets (infrastructure), and commodities (agriculture, minerals, etc.).
