Deutsche Bank Long-Term Ratings Placed on CWN


Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services said on March 26 it had placed its ‘A+' long-term counterparty credit ratings on Germany-based Deutsche Bank AG and several subsidiaries on CreditWatch with negative implications. At the same time, S&P affirmed its ‘A-1' short-term ratings on the entities, except for that on Deutsche Bank National Trust Company. The CreditWatch placement follows Deutsche Bank’s announcement on March 19, 2013, that it had increased its provisions for litigation in 2012 by €0.6 billion, compared with the preliminary results it released in January this year. Net income for the year therefore dropped to just €0.3 billion from the initial estimate of €0.7 billion. According to S&P, the group’s 2012 results are weak overall.Deutsche Bank’s capitalization is still below peers’, according to S&P, despite a significant improvement on the second half of 2012. More importantly, S&P still sees substantial risks to Deutsche Bank’s internal capital generation from unresolved economic and financial problems in the eurozone, particularly in view of recent tensions regarding Cyprus.
