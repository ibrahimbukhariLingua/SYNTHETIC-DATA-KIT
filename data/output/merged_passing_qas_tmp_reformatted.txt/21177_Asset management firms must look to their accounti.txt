Asset management firms must look to their accounting systems


Traditional accounting systems at asset management firms engender risks, increase operating costs, and delay the launch of new products, according to a white paper on accounting systems at asset management firms (“Accounting Solutions: Backbone of Investment Management,” available for download from http://www.simcorp.com/Home/Campaignsites/Investment-Accounting-white-p…), released by the provider of software and serviced to the financial sector Simcorp, undertaken by the consultant Woodbine associates.The white paper studies ways in which the weaknesses of outdated accounting platforms compromise the competitiveness of asset management firms, lead to human error, issues with violations of compliance, inability to detect cases of fraud, and approximations in the valuation of portfolios.The white paper points to the collapses of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, and claims that traditional accounting systems are poorly equipped to detect high-risk operations and errors in valuation. As a result, investment managers are not always able to rapidly and precisely djust their positions to react to market volatility.The document also emphasises rising costs associated with the inability of traditional accounting systems to develop at the same pace as the objectives of portfolio managers. According to Matt Samelson, director of Woodbine Associates and co-author of the white paper, “these asset management firms will not tolerate having to wait 4-6 weeks for the back office to take on a new type of fund or share, any more than business heads would tolerate delaying their entry into new markets because the systems in place are unable to adapt in terms of accounting, financial instruments, currencies and regulations in the countries concerned. In addition, investors have now become extremely vigilant about operational risks and the costs of professional processes and technologies used, which may result in catastrophic losses. This is particularly the case from their point of view when they need to apply procedures or solutions manually. And recent events have only increased this vigilance.”
