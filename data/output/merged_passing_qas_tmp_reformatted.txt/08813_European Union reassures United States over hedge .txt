European Union reassures United States over hedge fund directive


Michel Barnier, the European Union’s internal market commissioner, has written to Tim Geithner, the US Treasury secretary, to assure him that new rules for the hedge fund and private equity industries will not shut foreign funds out of EU financial markets, says the Financial Times. “I am convinced that access to the European single market should be granted to managers and funds domiciled in third countries, including the US, provided that high-level standards of transparency and security are guaranteed,” Mr Barnier wrote in a letter sent last week and seen by the Financial Times.
