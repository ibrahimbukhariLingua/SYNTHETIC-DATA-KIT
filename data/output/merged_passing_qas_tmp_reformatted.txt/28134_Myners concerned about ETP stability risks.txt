Myners concerned about ETP stability risks


Lord Paul Myners, former British minister for the City, has said in an interview with Financial News that a rise in ETP transactions could amplify market volatility in situations of redemptions, leading to a sell-off of underlying assets. That could destabilise the markets, particularly if they lack liquidity. He is also concerned about ETPs which concetrate on markets with poor levels of liquidity, or which could rapidly reach that state. He calls on the British Financial Conduct Authority to do more to protect financial stability.
