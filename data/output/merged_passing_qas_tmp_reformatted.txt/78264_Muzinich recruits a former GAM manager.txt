Muzinich recruits a former GAM manager


GAM veterans are continuing to resurface across the industry. After the recruitment of Matthias Wildhaber by Crédit Suisse last week, Muzinich & Co has recruited Laurence Kubli, a former bond manager from GAM, as a structured credit specialist in a newly-created position. Kubli left GAM following a major restructuring last year, after more than six years at the Swiss boutique. She had previously served in a variety of positions at Clariden Leu Bank, Man Group, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Credit Suisse. Kubli joins Muzinich & Co to launch the first structured debt fund from the firm. She will be based in Zurich. “Asset-backed securities can help investors to diversify their portfolios, because they tend to be less correlated to bond and traditional company loans, and because they have different risk characteristics,” the new manager at Muzinich & Co explains in a statement. “The integration of asset-backed securities into our product range is an excellent complement to our current capacities, as we continue to seek new and innovative ways to achieve the investment objectives of our clients,” says Tatjana Greil-Castro, portfolio manager at Muzinich & Co.
