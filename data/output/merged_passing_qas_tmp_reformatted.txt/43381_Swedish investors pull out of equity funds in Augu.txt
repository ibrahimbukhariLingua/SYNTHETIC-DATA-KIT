Virtually all equity funds are in negative territory, but the funds which suffered most were Swedish and North American equity funds, which saw outflows of over SEK2.2bn each. Outflows from equities dragged the entire sector of funds on sale in Sweden into negative territory: for the month, overall outflows add up to SEK4.5bn. The other fund categories have seen only small outflows (or slight outflows for bond funds), with the exception of money market funds, which saw inflows of SEK5.3bn. Since the beginning of the year, funds on sale in Sweden have posted further net subscriptions of SEK52.2bn, despite net outflows of SEK30.6bn from equity funds. As of the end of August, assets in Swedish funds totalled SEK3.185trn, of which 55% were invested in equities.
