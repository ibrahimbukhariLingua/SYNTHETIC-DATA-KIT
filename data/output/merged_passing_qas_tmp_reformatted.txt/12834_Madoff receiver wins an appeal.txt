Madoff receiver wins an appeal


The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on Tuesday supported a decision by Irving Picard, the court-appointed receiver for the business interests of imprisoned fraudster Bernard Madoff, to limit reimbursements to victims of the fraud to the amount of their losses, equivalent to USD17.3bn out of a total of USD64.3bn, the Wall Street Journal reports. In other words, investors who were net winners on the activities of Madoff will not be permitted to apply to the receiver for redemption of every dollar that was listed on their account statements.
