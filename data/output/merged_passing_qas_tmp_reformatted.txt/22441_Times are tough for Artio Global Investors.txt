Times are tough for Artio Global Investors


Artio Global Investors made its initial public offering in September 2009, raising USD650m. Since then, the asset management firm owned by Julius Baer has seen tough times, the Wall Street Journal reports. Assets under management have fallen 48% in first quarter to USD26.6bn, compared with the previous year, particularly under the effect of client net redemptions. Since its IPO, the decline has totalled 52%. Its two flagship funds, two of them international equity products, underperformed in 2011.
