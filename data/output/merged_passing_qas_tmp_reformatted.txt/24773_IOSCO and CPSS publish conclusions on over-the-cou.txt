IOSCO and CPSS publish conclusions on over-the-counter derivatives


The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the technical committee of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) on 17 January published their final report on the operation of registries that would centralise and redistribute information about over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments. Some questions remain regarding how best to address current data gaps and define authorities’ access to TRs. As requested by the G20, two internationally coordinated working groups will address these questions in the coming year. The FSB will establish an ad hoc group of experts to further consider means of filling current data gaps, while the CPSS and IOSCO will establish a joint group to examine authorities’ access to trade repositories.
