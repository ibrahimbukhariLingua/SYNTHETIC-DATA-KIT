CalPERS measures impact of sustainability on performance


The Californian pension fund CalPERS on 28 January announced the launch of a research programme, the Sustainable Investment Research Initiative (SIRI), which aims to measure the impact of sustainability factors on financial performance. In partnership with the US Davis Graduate School of Management, CalPERS has also issued a request for proposals for a series of studies by academics and investment specialists on the impact of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria on the creation of long-term value and the stability of financial markets. The first articles on these issues may be presented on 7 June this year, at the inaugural Sustainability & Finance Symposium.
