European banks request a postponement of Basel III


At a time when the US authorities have postponed Basel III standards, without providing a new time frame, European banks are worried. Their representative federation in Europe, the FBE, on 21 November sent a letter to the European Commission, requesting a one-year delay until 2014 in the introduction of the regulation, which is considered stricter in terms of owners’ equity, the news agency Reuters reports. In the letter, which has been obtained by Reuters, and which was sent to the commissioner of the internal market, Michel Barnier, the FBE claims that European banking establishments would be at a competitive disadvantage if they were required to obey the new owners’ equity requirements before US banks.
