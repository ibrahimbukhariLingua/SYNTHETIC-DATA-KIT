UBS in definitive settlement with US tax authorities today


In the US tax fraud scandal, UBS bank will seal its fate today, La Tribune reports. By handing over information including the identities of 5,000 of its clients, a definitive agreement with the US tax authorities will allow it to close this chapter in the legal battle it has been engaged in for more than one year. Some US lawyers estimate that the list will be twice as long, the newspaper reports. However, UBS will not pay a fine to the US authorities. For several months, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been inviting tax evaders to turn themselves in spontaneously, in exchange for mitigated treatment. Many US citizens have already chosen this option.
