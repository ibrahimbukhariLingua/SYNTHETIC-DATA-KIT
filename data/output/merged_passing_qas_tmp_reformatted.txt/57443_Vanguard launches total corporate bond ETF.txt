Vanguard launches total corporate bond ETF


Vanguard launched Vanguard Total Corporate Bond ETF (VTC), expanding its U.S. fixed income fund roster to 17 ETFs and 51 indexed and actively managed mutual funds. The fund offers investors low-cost exposure to the broad U.S. investment-grade corporate bond market through a single fund. “The Total Corporate Bond ETF provides investors with a core portfolio building block and is a welcome addition to Vanguard’s diversified lineup of low-cost bond ETFs,” said John Hollyer, global head of Vanguard Fixed Income Group.The new fund seeks to track the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Bond Index and trades on the NASDAQ stock exchange with an expense ratio of 0.07%1. It is structured as an ETF of ETFs, investing directly in Vanguard’s three existing, low-cost corporate bond ETFs: Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCSH), Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCIT), and Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCLT). The ETF of ETFs structure enables the fund to immediately access more than 5,500 U.S. corporate bonds by taking advantage of the existing exposure and scale offered by the underlying ETFs. This approach achieves near complete replication of the benchmark at the fund’s inception as well as tighter bid/ask spreads and lower operating expenses than investing directly in the benchmark’s constituents.
