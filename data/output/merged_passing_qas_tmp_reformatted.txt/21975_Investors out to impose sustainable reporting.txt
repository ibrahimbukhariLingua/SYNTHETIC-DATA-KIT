Investors out to impose sustainable reporting


A coalition representing USD2 trillion of investor assets calls on Ministers at Rio+20 Earth Summit to mandate corporate sustainability reporting.Led by Aviva Investors, the group, also including NGOs, church groups and UN agencies, has called on government representatives at the Rio+20 Earth summit to require public and large global private corporations to integrate material environmental, social and governance issues in their Annual Report and Accounts, on a report or explain basis.In an open letter to Ministers, Paul Abberley, interim chief executive of Aviva Investors and representative for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Coalition (CSRC), said: “(…) At present 75% of companies do not report on sustainability issues at all. While this trend is improving, at the current trajectory it will be decades before sustainability reporting is common practice across global markets (…)”.
