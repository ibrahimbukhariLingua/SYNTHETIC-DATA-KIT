The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has banned Magnus Michael Peterson, the former head of the hedge fund Weavering Macro Fixed Income Fund Limited, from performing any function related to any regulated activity. On 19 January 2015 Mr Peterson was convicted of a range of fraud offences through his hedge fund resulting in losses to clients of approximately USD536m. Mr Peterson was sentenced on 23 January 2015 to a total of 13 years’ imprisonment at Southwark Crown Court.These crimes were committed when Mr Peterson was approved by the FCA to perform various controlled functions - between 31 July 2003 and 31 March 2009. «Mr Peterson defrauded investors who should have been able to trust him. Over a prolonged period he purposely used investors’ money to prop up his business, and then lied in order to cover up his deception. To protect consumers and markets we have banned Mr Peterson from working in financial services,» said Mark Steward, Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the Financial Conduct Authority.
