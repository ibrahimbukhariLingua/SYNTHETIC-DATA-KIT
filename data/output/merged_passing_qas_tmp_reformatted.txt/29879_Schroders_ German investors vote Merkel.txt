Schroders: German investors vote Merkel


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In total, 87% of 1000 Germans who have at least EUR10,000 in investments who participated in the Schroders Global Investment Trends 2013 survey are planning to make investments this year equal to or higher than those in 2012, and 66% feel that Angela Merkel will be re-elected as chancellor after legislative elections in late September. Among these, 66% feel that the re-election will be positive for the Dax and Euro Stoxx 50.Only 17% of Germans surveyed feel that the SPD candidate, Peer Steinbr√ºck, will be elected chancellor, and only 7% think that if he is elected, it will have a positive impact on the Dax and Euro Stoxx 50.The survey also finds that 76% of German investors are planning to take positions this year on equities, which may be a surprising percentage, since Germans are thought to be reticent about equities, and a higher percentage of them than the global average (68%) are preferring this asset class.However, confidence does not rule out caution: 52% of Germans are betting on lower-risk investments, although they are less profitable, while 33% prefer a moderate risk, and less than 16% are prepared to run higher risk in order to achieve higher returns.
