Investors increasingly pessimistic about businesses


Investors are expecting difficult months at businesses worldwide as well as a macroeconomic environment that remains highly tense. According to the most recent BofA Merrill Lynch survey, undertaken between 6 and 12 July of 190 investors representing an overall total of USD567bn in assets under management, 38% of allocators estimate that corporate profits will deteriorate in the next twelve months. Last month, 19% of the sample was expecting a deterioration in the micro-economic environment worldwide. In terms of the health of economies, a net total of 13% of allocators estimate that global conjuncture will deteriorate in the next 12 months, compared with 11% one month ago. In this context, liquidity reserves at allocators remain high. 33% are overweight in cash, compared with 39% in June. US equities have seen their popularity fall in the past month. Only 14% of allocators are overweight, compared with 31% previously. However, the percentage who are underweight on European equities has declined, from 36% to 26%. Emerging market equities have become, as the study says, “by default,” the strongest overweight position for respondents, with 19% overweight. 23% remain underweight on bonds, which remains unchanged since the last survey. Allocation to commodities in July were at their lowest since February 2009. 13% of allocators overweight this asset class.
