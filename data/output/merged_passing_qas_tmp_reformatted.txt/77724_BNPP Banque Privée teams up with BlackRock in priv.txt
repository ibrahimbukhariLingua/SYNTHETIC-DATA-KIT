BNPP Banque Privée teams up with BlackRock in private equity


BNP Paribas Banque Privée has in early April negotiated direct access to a private equity co-investment fund managed by BlackRock. The agreement signed with the largest asset management company in the world by assets under management covers exclusive distribution in France for the BlackRock Private Equity Opportunities ELTIF fund. The fund provides direct privately-owned businesses jointly with other private equity funds. “The fund opens direct access for qualified investors to an investment strategy which is traditionally reserved for institutional clients, for a minimum subscription of €125,000,” the private bank says in a statement, adding that the product is aimed at clients seeking to optimise long-term returns, in exchange for risk of capital loss and a 10- to 12-year lock-in of their capital.
