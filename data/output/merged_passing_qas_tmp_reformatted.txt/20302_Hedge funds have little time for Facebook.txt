Hedge funds have little time for Facebook


At the end of a catastrophic week for Facebook, quarterly figures released by hedge funds suggest that many more of them had bet against against than for Facebook. Rumours are rife on the markets that hedge funds were not required to disclose their short positions, the news agency Reuters reports. Only a few actors in alternative management are said to have bet against the firm founded by Mark Zuckerberg, including George Soros, Steve Cohen (SAC Capital Advisors) and John Thaler (JAT Capital Management). On Thursday evening, Facebook fell below USD20bn, a decline of nearly 50% from its value at its IPO of USD38 per share.
