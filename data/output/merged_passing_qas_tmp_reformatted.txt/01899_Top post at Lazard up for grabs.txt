Top post at Lazard up for grabs


La Tribune reports that following the decease of Bruce Wasserstein, head of Lazard, the board of directors at the bank has appointed the vice-president of the firm, Steven Golub, 63, as interim CEO. On 27 October, in addition to approving the accounts for third quarter, the board of directors will also elect a new CEO. Due to the advanced age of Golub, other bankers may challenge him for the position, including Charles Ward, head of asset management activities at the firm, Jeffrey Rosen, a proteg√© of Wasserstein, and Gary Parr, a younger face at the firm. The duties of chairman and CEO may be separated, the newspaper notes.
