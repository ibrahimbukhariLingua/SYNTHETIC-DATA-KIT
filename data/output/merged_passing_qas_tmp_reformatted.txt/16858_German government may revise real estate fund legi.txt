German government may revise real estate fund legislation


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports that the German parliamentary CDU/CSU and FDP groups are planning to amend the proposed open-ended real estate fund legislation. They are planning to remove the required markdown on property valuations when properties are resold within 2 years (10%) or 3 years (5%), and to reduce the minimal period a property should be held from 2 years to 1 year, to allow retail investors to make withdrawals limited to EUR30,000 per year, and to lower the maximal leverage level for the funds from 50% to 30%.
