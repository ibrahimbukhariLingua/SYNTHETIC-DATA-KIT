US asset management firms move away from salesforce channelization


Asset managers in the United States are shifting away from salesforce channelization, according to new research from Cerulli Associates. More than 50% of asset managers have reported moving away from organizing their salesforce by channel, compared to more than 30% in 2011. «For two decades, firms were organizing their salesforces by segmenting the industry into distribution channels, and assigning territories to wholesalers based on a combination of geographic factors and channel attributes,» Pamela DeBolt, associate director at Cerulli, explains. «Industry consolidation, technology, and the rise of fee-based platforms have created a new landscape in which firms are trending away from a channelized view of distribution.» «Firms are no longer able to rely on the classification of their clients into neat groups of channels that share similar characteristics,» DeBolt continues. «Firms are organizing their sales efforts around their key accounts and most promising client relationships, with key account managers playing an increasingly important role and wholesalers relying on them more.»
