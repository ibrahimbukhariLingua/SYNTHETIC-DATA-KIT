Neptune raises questions about plans to move Prudential


The founder of Neptune, Robin Geffen, has raised questions about plans to move the headquarters of Prudential from London to Hong Kong. According to rumours that Prudential is not denying, the head of Prudential, Tidjane Thiam, is planning to leave London in order to avoid the inconveniences of Solvency II regulations. Geffen claims in a column in the Scotsman newspaper that such a move could legitimately make investors ask questions about the solvency of the group, and particularly about the future of its asset management unit, M&G.“That’s one way for the group to avoid European solvency ratios. Investors would be right to be concerned,” Geffen claims. Neptune holds a stake of less than 3% in the British insurer.
