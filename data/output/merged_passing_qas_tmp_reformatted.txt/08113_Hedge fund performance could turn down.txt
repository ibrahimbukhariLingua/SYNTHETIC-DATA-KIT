Hedge fund performance could turn down


Typical annual returns of hedge funds would drop to 10 per cent – or less – if funds became too defensive as the economic environment turned increasingly challenging, according to Byron Wien, the vice-chairman of Blackstone’s advisory group and former chief investment strategist at Pequot Capital. According to the Financial Times, he told the GAIM conference in Monaco: “The concept of hedge funds was to produce equity-like returns with bond-like volatility. The danger is we get bond-like returns with equity-like volatility.”
