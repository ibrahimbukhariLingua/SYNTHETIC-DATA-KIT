Novaxia creates finance and real estate units


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Novaxia, a specialist in real estate private equity, is developing its structure and management, with the creation of two major units for finance and real estate, the firm announced on 1 February. The objective with this move is to “support the growth strategy” of the group, Novaxia says. As part of the new organisation, Novaxia has recruited Bruno Cossé as director for the finance unit. Mathieu Descout, previously chief development officer, has been appointed as director for real estate. Before joining Novaxia at the beginning of February, Cossé served in a variety of real estate and finance positions, including a stint at STAM Europe from 2002 as deputy CEO for finance. Over his career, Cossé has also been head of financial controlling at Thomson CSF Finance, an affiliate of Thalès, before joining the Consortium de Réalisation Immobilier (CRD). At Novaxia, his main mission will be to “implement and concretise the growth strategy of the firm, including making its expertise available to clients, extended to include institutional investors, in the transformation and valuation of assets, financial resources, and performance measurement,” a statement says. Descout, for his part, joined Novaxia in 2014, and was previously chief development officer. In his new role, he will be responsible with a team of 20 experts for the management of assets in its entirety, from sourcing through holding and development.
