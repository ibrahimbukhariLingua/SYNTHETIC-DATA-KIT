Argentina sentenced to repay two vulture funds


Argentina was on 26 August sentenced in a New York appeals court to repay nearly USD1.5bn to NML Capital and Aurelius, two “vulture funds” which had refused a restructuring of the country’s debt following its bankruptcy in 2001, Agefi Switzerland reports. The decision may threaten future debt restructuring, and could trigger another payment default by Argentina, but the application of the verdict is suspended under a ruling by the US Supreme Court, which will consider the case.
