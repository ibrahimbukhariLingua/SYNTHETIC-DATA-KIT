British FCA continues to examine RDR regulations


The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has launched the second phase of its examination of RDR regulations, in the form of a questionnaire sent to 120 consulting firms, Investment Week reports. The questionnaire, part of a study of the impact of RDR regulation, will be “statistically more pertinent” than the first one, which aimed to measure respect for the new price structure by evaluating practices in the profession.
