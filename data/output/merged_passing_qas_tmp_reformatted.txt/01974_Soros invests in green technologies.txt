Soros invests in green technologies


George Soros announced on Saturday plans to invest as much as USD1bn in clean-energy technologies while forming a new climate-policy arm to combat global warming, said the Financial Times. “I will look for profitable opportunities, but I will also insist that the investments make a real contribution to solving the problem of climate change,” he said.
