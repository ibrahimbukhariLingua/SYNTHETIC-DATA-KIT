BFT Gestion joins Amundi


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Agefi reports that plans to spin off the Banque de financement et de trésorerie (BFT), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crédit Agricole SA, have been made official internally. The operation will see BFT Gestion made a part of Amundi, the asset management affiliate of Crédit Agricole SA, where it will continue to operate as an independent entity. Asset management via a dedicated affiliate, BFT Gesion, is one of the three major activities of the firm, the newspaper reports. With more than EUR20bn in assets under management as of the end of 2010, the firm had a good year, despite its specialisation in money markets. Inflows of EUR2.2bn put it in third place in France in the mutual fund sector. Crédit Agricole SA, which on 17 March will unveil its strategic plan, claims that the move “is not a punishment for the teams at BFT, and there will be no layoffs,” a source familiar with the mater says.
