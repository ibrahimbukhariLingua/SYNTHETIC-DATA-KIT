Deutsche Bank may transfer EUR300bn in assets from London to Frankfurt


Deutsche Bank may transfer about EUR300bn in assets from the balance sheet of its British operation to its Frankfurt one due to Brexit, the news agency Bloomberg reported on Monday evening, on the basis of information from “a person familiar with the matter.” The plans, entitled “Bowline,” would have trading activities transferred to the German city from September 2018, and assets to be transferred by March 2019, the source says. The total EUR300bn sum is equivalent to one fifth of the total balance sheet of Deutsche Bank (EUR1.590trn).Bloomberg says that in an internal video, CEO John Cryan explains to employees that he expects a “hard Brexit” with a “vast majority” of transactions currently passing through London to be moved to Frankfurt, though the bank has not yet made anything official.The assets affected are said more precisely to be those in trading and investment banking activities. Nearly 20,000 client accounts would also be transferred. These clients would be informed by letter in September.
