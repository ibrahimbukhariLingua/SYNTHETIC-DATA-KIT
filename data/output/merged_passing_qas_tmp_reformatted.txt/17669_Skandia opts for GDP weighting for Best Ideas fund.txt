Skandia opts for GDP weighting for Best Ideas fund


Old Mutual Global Investors (OBGI) has announced that its Skandia Global Best Ideas fund (GBP275m) will be diversifying its portfolio to adopt an approach to strategic allocation moderated by GDP instead of the more traditional model which had previously exposed the half of the portfolio to British equities and half to global equities.The change will mean that the firm will be more highly diversified in terms of countries and currencies. In addition to geographical diversification, the changes will result in a reduction of about 6 basis points to TER.The new regional weightings will be as follows:Region/Former allocation/New allocationEurope including R-U 61.89%//26/66%United States 13/66%/26/29%Japan 4.91%/9.46%Asia-Pacific ex Japan 8.33%/23/93%Emerging markets ex Asia 11.21%/13.66%
