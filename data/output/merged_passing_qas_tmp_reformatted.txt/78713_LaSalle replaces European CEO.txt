LaSalle replaces European CEO


LaSalle Investment Management, a specialist in real estate investment, on Wednesday announced the appointment of Karen Brennan, currently head of third party mandates for the Americas at LaSalle. He will succeed Simon Marrison as CEO for Europe from 30 June 2019. Marrison, who had served in the role for 12 years, will become chairman on that date, and will work in close collaboration with Brennan to ensure a smooth transition. The activities of LaSalle in Europe doubled during their period under the leadership of Marrison, from $10bn to over $20bn. Marrison joined LaSalle in 2001, and managed six funds in the region. In her new role, Brennan will be responsible for the private real estate activities of the firm in continental Europe, and will join the executive committee at the company, composed of nine people. Brennan will be based in London. She will also oversee the teams in Paris, Munich and Luxembourg, and will travel regularly to the markets in which LaSalle operates and invests. Brennan joined LaSalle in 1999, and served in a variety of senior roles on investment and asset management teams. From 2008 to 2012, Brennan served at the Singapore and Hong Kong offices, where she was a portfolio manager for the LaSalle Asia Opportunity ex Japan fund. More recently, she directed the group responsible for managing mandates for third parties, including some of the largest institutional clients of LaSalle, and increased the assets under management at the firm by over 30%, to a total of $10bn.
