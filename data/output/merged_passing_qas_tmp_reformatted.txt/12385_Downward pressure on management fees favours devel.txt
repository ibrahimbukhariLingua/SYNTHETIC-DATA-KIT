Downward pressure on management fees favours development of low-cost funds


The time when managers could impose commission increases on funds has come to an end. At a time when costs are rising, asset managers are now having to accept reductions in their income. According to a study by Cerulli Associates (“European Fund Fee Analysis,” August 2011), the rise of passive management, regulatory changes, and recurrent criticism of fee levels are requiring active managers to change their positions on commissions and management fees. In order to remain competitive, reduced commissions appear to be inevitable, Cerulli estimates. The power to dictate prices remains the privilege of the best managers, and as in the luxuries sector, those who can offer something more than their rivals also have the pricing power, Cerulli observes. Less well-performing actors, who do not have good distribution networks, or who don’t have the best track records, will realise that it is increasingly difficult to justify high commissions in comparison with beta rivals, explains Yoon Ng, a senior analyst at Cerulli in London. However, the active management model is far from outmoded. Passive funds have managed to outperform active funds in only two asset classes out of five: diversified funds and commodities. Active funds performed better over three years in equities, alternative assets and bonds, even with administrative and management fees taken into account.In order to prove their superiority, active managers have often offered emerging markets equities funds or absolute return funds whose average fees total 2% and 1.6%, respectively; these are currently the best-selling funds.Ultimately, a vast majority of managers have ultimately moved to diversify their model and to offer both active and passive strategies. Among the elite management firms in terms of assets under management, only one firm is not yet offering passive strategies.Active managers with no passive funds in their product range have recently been launching low-cost active funds. Cerulli finds that this trend is not new, and that a recent study undertaken in partnership with Ignites Europe found that half of managers surveyed offered funds with a total TER of less than 1%, and that 60% of managers said they were planning to launch low-cost funds. Cerulli says growth in the low-cost actively-managed fund sector will be driven not only be active managers, but also by tracker funds, providers of ETFs, and fund of fund assemblers.
