Twitter becomes new investment tool for hedge funds


Social networks are proving useful for investment strategies. According to experts, the instantaneous character of Twitter means that collective mood can be measures with much more precision than previously. The result is that millions of tweets are now analysed by hedge fund managers to predict future movement of the markets.A London-based asset management firm, Derwent Capital Markets, has launched a GBP25m fund, which takes investment decisions on the basis of the mood of the general public, the Telegraph reports in its 11 September issue. The manager and founder of the firm, Paul Hawtin, has signed an exclusive contract with Johan Bollen, an IT specialist at the University of Indiana, who has designed a software program to use tweets for this purpose.A commonplace notion would have it that the direction of the markets determines people’s moods. In other words, depression on the markets leads to a depressed population. That was Bollen’s initial assumption as well. But a study of the correlations between the movements of the Dow Jones and the ambient mood of the people has demonstrated that the reverse is true: it is the ambient sentiment of the moment that determines the direction of the markets. In October 2010, the observation of moods on social networks allowed Bollen to predict the direction of the Dow Jones with 87.6% accuracy.
