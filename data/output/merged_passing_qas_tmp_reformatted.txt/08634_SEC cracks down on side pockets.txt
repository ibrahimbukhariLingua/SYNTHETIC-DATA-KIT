SEC cracks down on side pockets


The SEC has created an enforcement unit with 60 attorneys led by Rob Kaplan and Bruce Karpati to investigate the use of side pockets by private equity funds, hedge funds and other asset managers, the Wall Street Journal reports. Some funds examined by the SEC may have provided an inaccurate evaluation of their assets in side pocketseven as they continued to charge commissions on these inflated valuations. The new enforcement unit will also seek to establish to what extent managers are honest when they invest their own money in their funds.
