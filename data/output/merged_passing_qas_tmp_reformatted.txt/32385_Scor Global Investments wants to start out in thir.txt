Scor Global Investments wants to start out in third-party management


Scor Global Investments, the asset management unit of the Scor group, has launched a website independent of that of its parent company. Agefi Weekly reports that the tool is intended to help the company grow, as it is planning to develop third-party activities. So far, results remain modest, as the firm has posted inflows of slightly over EUR100m. Without setting an overly ambitious objective, François de Varenne, chairman of the board, sees bigger. “If, in three to five years, I have the equivalent of 10% of assets from the Scor group under management for third parties, which would be EUR1bn to EUR2bn, I would be delighted,” he says. At this stage, activities are concentrated on continental Europe. Scor GI is targeting private banks, family offices and large institutional investors as its first priority.
