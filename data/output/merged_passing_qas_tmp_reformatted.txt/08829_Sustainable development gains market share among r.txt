Sustainable development gains market share among retail investors


According to a survey undertaken on behalf of Union Investment by the Forsa institute of 500 household “financial decision-makers” (aged 20-59), 32% of German investors estimate that sustainable development investments are attractive, compared with 27% who consider them uninteresting. In the 20-29 year old age group, the number of favourable opinions of green investment is far higher, at 45%. Meanwhile, 63% of those surveyed say that they are prepared to settle for lower returns on their investments in order to support sustainable development, while 35% say that they do not want to sacrifice a part of their expected financial gains.
