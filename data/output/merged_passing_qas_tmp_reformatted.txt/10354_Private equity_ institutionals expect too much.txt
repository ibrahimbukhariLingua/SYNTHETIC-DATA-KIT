Private equity: institutionals expect too much


There is a mismatch between long term actual and expected returns for private equity strategies, reveals bfinance in a global survey of institutional investors issued yesterday. Responses from institutional investors highlight a significant difference between expected returns from private equity strategies and the reality of realised net of fees returns in their portfolio. 93% of institutions set their private equity funds a performance target (net internal rate of return - IRR) of over 10% yet less than half generated an actual net IRR of more than 10%.However expectations and experience varies greatly by investment strategy. In terms of individual strategies, institutions considered expected returns from private debt investments as the most closely aligned with actual returns.74% expected a net IRR of over 10% and nearly 70% achieved this. In contrast investors’ sentiment on venture capital shows the largest difference between expectations and past experience with 87% of all investors expecting over 10% net IRR and only 44% of such investors having achieved 10% or above net IRR from prior venture capital investments.Also according to bfinance, 88% of investors identified «portfolio return enhancement» as the first or second most important reason to invest in private equity. A similarly important rationale for investing in private equity is the ability to obtain returns from sources not accessible through public markets: 81% of all investors say this as the first or second reason for investing. In contrast, only 24% of investors saw «risk diversification» as being amongst the first two reasons for allocating to private equity.
