Tobin tax will not apply to bonds


A tax on financial transactions would bring in EUR1bn per year, four times more than the market tax repealed in 2008, Les Echos reports. The government will target all securities traded in Paris. Equities would be taxed 0.1%, as stipulated in the European directive. Bonds would not be taxed.
