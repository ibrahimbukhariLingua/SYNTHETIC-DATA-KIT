Vanguard launches two bond funds with ETF share classes


The US firm Vanguard has filed with the SEC for two international bond funds, Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund and Vanguard Emerging Markets Government Bond Index Fund.The Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund will aim to replicate the performance of the Barclays Global Aggregate ex-USD Float Adjusted Index (Hedged) and will thus use currency hedging techniques.The product will be a part of the Vanguard Total product range, which has about USD300bn in assets.The Vanguard Emerging Markets Government Bond Index Fund will track the Barclays Emerging Markets Sovereign Index (USD). The portfolio will invest exclusively in emerging market government bonds denominated in US dollars, which eliminates currency risks for investors based in the United States.Vanguard will offer both traditional share classes for the two new funds (Investor, Admiral and Institutional), and ETF share classes. The latter will cost 0.30% for the Total International Bond Fund, and 0.35% for the Emerging Markets Government Bond Index Fund.
