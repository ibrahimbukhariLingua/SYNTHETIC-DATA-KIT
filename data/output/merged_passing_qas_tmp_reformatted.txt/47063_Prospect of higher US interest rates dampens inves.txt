Prospect of higher US interest rates dampens investors’ spirits


Data showing the US unemployment rate in February dropped to a more six year low of 5.5% has forced investors to revisit the question of when US interest rates will start to climb. Outflows for US bond funds during the week ending March 11 suggest a growing number of those investors expect a rate hike by the third quarter, according to EPFR Global.Having taken in USD48 billion during fourth quarter of 2014, US equity funds have seen over USD33 billion redeemed year to date because of the stronger dollar.Flows into Europe equity funds exceeded USD5 billion for the fourth time in the past seven weeks as the European Central Bank’s quantitative easing program kicked off.Overall, EPFR bond funds absorbed a net USD2.7 billion during the seven days ending March 11 and money market funds nearly USD20 billion while equity funds collectively posted modest outflows of USD695 million.
