QuantValley: make Paris a major centre of quantitative alternative management


Following on the observation that the Paris market is poor in quantitative alternative management firms, QuantValley, an association with 20 founding partners, including eight asset management firms, academic institutions (Paris-Dauphine, Institut Louis Bachelier, Ensae), the competitiveness unit Finance Innovation and SMBs – has unveiled its initiative entitled “Paris: City of Quants 2020,” Agefi reports. The objective is to make this strategy represent 10% of assets under diversified management in France, as their percentage of assets in London is ten times higher. The initiative hopes to eventually make Paris the top centre in continental Europe for active quantitative management. On Thursday, 17 November, at the inception of the project, it was announced that a research project had been initiated, entitled “Development of quantitative management.” The research will be carried out by Paris-Dauphine university and ENSAE ParisTech.
