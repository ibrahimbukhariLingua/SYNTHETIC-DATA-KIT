Feri EuroRating: ETFs show strong potential to penetrate retail markets


The results of an online survey of 572 Germans between 28 July and 14 September by Feri EuroRating Services reveal that 79% of respondents expect ETFs to show significant average net subscriptions in the next three to five years, while 45% of respondents are planning to increase their allocation to ETFs in the next two to three years. However, 52% of respondents do not yet have ETFs in their portfolio, while these products represent more than one third of the portfolios of only 8% of those surveyed. Feri EuroRatings finds that cost is the determining factor behind investment in ETFs, and that 74% of respondents are not prepared to pay more than 0.25% commission for a bond ETF. The other two decisive characteristics are the choice of underlying (for 46% of respondents) and transparency (32%). However, the reputation of the management firm and construction are important secondary factors (17% and 16%). Respondents spontaneously cited the issuers iShares (BlackRock) 202 times, db x-trackers (Deutsche Bank) 167 times, and Lyxor Asset Management (Société Générale) 132 times. ComStage ranked fourth, with only 38 mentions.
