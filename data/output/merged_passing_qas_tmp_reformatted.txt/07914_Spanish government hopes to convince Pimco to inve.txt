Spanish government hopes to convince Pimco to invest in its bonds


José Manuel Campa, Spanish secretary of state for the economy, on Monday held a meeting with “some of the main investors” in his government (banks, fund managers, and hedge funds) to explain to them “the reality of the Spanish economic situation, and to attempt to dispel the unfounded negative sentiment which is currently prevailing,” Expansión reports. On Thursday, the day after meeting the New York Times, Bloomberg, and the Financial Times in New York, he was to meet heads at Pimco, including Bill Gross, who manages the largest bond fund in the world, with USD464bn in assets. Gross has been one of the charpest critics of Spain in recent months.
