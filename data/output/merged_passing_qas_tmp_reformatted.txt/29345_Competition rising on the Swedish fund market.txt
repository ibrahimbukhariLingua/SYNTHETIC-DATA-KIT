Competition rising on the Swedish fund market


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In the decade of the 2000s, the market share for the four largest asset management firms in Sweden fell from 80% to 50% of assets under management, Fondbolagens Förening, the Swedish investment fund association, has revealed at the publication of a report on competition in the financial sector by the competition watchdog authority. This was due to the effect of the arrival of foreign firms on the market, as well as independent structures. However, tougher European regulations complicate the creation of new asset management firms, the association regrets. Also, several Swedish initiatives have damages competitive conditions. To improve things, Fondbolagens Förening is calling for three changes. It would like for asset management firms to be able to open investment savings accounts for savings investors, that the taxation be the same for all finance sector players, and that there should be more openness about commissions. However, it does not want these to be forbidden.
