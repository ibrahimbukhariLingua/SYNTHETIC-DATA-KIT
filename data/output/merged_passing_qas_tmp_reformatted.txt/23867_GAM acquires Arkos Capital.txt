GAM acquires Arkos Capital


GAM Group AG (GAM), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GAM Holding AG, announced on 28 February that it will soon be acquiring Arkos Capital SA, a Swiss independent wealth management firm, whose assets under management total CHF664m. The transaction will be completed by the end of second quarter 2012, pending approval from regulatory authorities. All key employees will be retained, including fund managers. They will continue to be based in Lugano, Switzerland. By the terms of the agreement, GAM will acquire 74.95% of share capital, once approval from the relevant regulatory authorities has been obtained, likely by the end of second quarter 2012. The remaining 25.05% stake, currently held by the management of Arkos, will be acquired via payments in various forms, depending on the future development of activities. The acquisition will have the effect of increasing profits at GAM from day one.
