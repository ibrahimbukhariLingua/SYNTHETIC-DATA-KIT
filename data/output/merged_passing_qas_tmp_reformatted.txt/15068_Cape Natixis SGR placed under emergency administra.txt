Cape Natixis SGR placed under emergency administration


The Italian asset management firm Cape Natixis, in which Natixis Private Equity owns 49%, has been placed in administration. “The minister of finance and the economy, at the suggestion of the Bank of Italy and the favourable opinion of Consob, has decided to dissolve the administrative and control organs of Cape Natixis SGR, based in Milan, and to place the firm under extraordinary administration, by a decree of 4 April 2011,” the Bank of Italy announced in a statement on 6 April. The decision to place the private equity firm under extraordinary administration was motivated by “severe irregularities in administration and regulatory violations” which emerged during an audit.
