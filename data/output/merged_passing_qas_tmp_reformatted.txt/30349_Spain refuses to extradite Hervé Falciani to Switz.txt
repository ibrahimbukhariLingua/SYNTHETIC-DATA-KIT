P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Spanish courts on 8 May refused to extradite the Swiss former HSBC bank IT employee Hervé Falciani, claiming that the deeds he is accused of would not be subject to prosecution in Spain, the National Audience court in Madrid has declared. Falciani, who was arrested in Barcelona in 2012, and who holds French and Italian citizenship, is accused by Switzerland of theft of banking data which made it possible to identify thousands of tax evaders. Switzerland, which issued an international arrest warrant for him, had requested his extradition froM Spain for theft and disclosure of industrial or commercial secrets and banking confidentiality. In its verdict, the National Audience claims that the deeds cited by Switzerland would not be subject ot prosecution in Spain, as in the latter country there is not “a specific penal protection of banking confidentiality as such.”
