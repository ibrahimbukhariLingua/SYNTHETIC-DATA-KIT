p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } UBS will be required to appear before a court in the United States over its sale of collateralized debt obligations (CDO). According to several press agencies, a New York court on Tuesday found that a lawsuit by the US investment firm Loreley Financing dating back several years will go to court. The suit is for USD331m. Loreley Financing previously filed suit against UBS and other banks in 2011 and 2012 for false information as part of sales of CDOs. The securities, which included Residential Mortgage-backed Securities (RMBS) and Credit Default Swaps (CDS), were sold in 2006 and 2007 and caused Loreley heavy losses during the financial crisis.
