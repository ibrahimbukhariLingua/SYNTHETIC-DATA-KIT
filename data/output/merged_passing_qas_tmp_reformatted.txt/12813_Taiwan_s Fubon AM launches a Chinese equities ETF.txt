Taiwanâ€™s Fubon AM launches a Chinese equities ETF


The Taiwan-based management firm Fubon Asset Management, which a few months ago received an allocation of USD100m as a qualified foreign institutional investor (QFII), will launch an ETF at the end of September which will replicate the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) 180 Index, and will be listed on the Taiwan stock exchange, Asian Investor reports. Fubon hopes to raise TWD3bn, more or less equivalent to the USD100m quota it has received.
