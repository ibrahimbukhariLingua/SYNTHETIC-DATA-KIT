Pimco has stopped buying Spanish bonds


Bill Gross (Pimco), Edouard Carmignac (Carmignac Patrimoine), Fidelity, DWS (Deutsche Bank), Investec and several other major international managers have not been buying up any more Spanish bonds for some time. The funds which are beginning to turn their backs on Spanish bonds already hold 17.3% of the country’s public debt, Expansión points out. The newspaper adds that managers are explaining that their abstinence is due to an increase in volatility and not by a risk of default.
