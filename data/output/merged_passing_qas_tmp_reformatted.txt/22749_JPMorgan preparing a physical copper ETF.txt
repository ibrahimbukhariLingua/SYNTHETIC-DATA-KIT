JPMorgan preparing a physical copper ETF


J.P. Morgan Commodity ETF Services LLP has filed to the SEC for a license to list a fund investing in physical copper stored by the Henry Bath Group, another J.P. Morgan affiliate. The new product would be listed by June on NYSE Euronext, and does not yet have an acronym or TER level. The filing states that the fund would not be actively managed. 6.18 million shares would initially be offered.
