Julius Baer publishes its first report on Asian high net worth individuals


In cooperation with the independent brokerage firm CLSA, the Swiss firm Julius Baer on 31 August published its first “Julius Baer Wealth Report,” focusing on themarket for high net worth individuals (HNWI) in Asia.At the time of the survey’s release, the Swiss group also launched the new Julius Baer Lifestyle Index, which tracks consumer prices in the Asia-Pacific region, and the rate of inflation particular to them. It takes into account a basket of 20 luxury goods and services representative of the consumer spending of HNWI, from high-end shops and businesses located in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore and Mumbai. In the twelve months to the end of April, the index has risen 11.7%, while the conventional consumer price indices have risen only 5.1% at the same time. This shows that the cost of living for HNWI in Asia is becoming more expensive much more rapidly than the average.According to the report’s predictions, the number of HNWI in Asia is expected to reach 2.82 million in 2015, with total wealth of USD15.81trn. Their total number in 2010 was 1.16 million, with USD5.6trn in assets. However, Julius Baer points out that the appreciation of Asian currencies may generate as many as 600,000 dollar millionaires by 2015.In the baseline scenario, China alone would have about 1.4 million HNWI by 2015, with wealth of USD8.76trn.
