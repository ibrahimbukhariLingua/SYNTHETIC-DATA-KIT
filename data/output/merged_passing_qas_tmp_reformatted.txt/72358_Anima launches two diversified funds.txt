The two funds will come as an addition to the multi-asset class range, which already includes Anima Sforzesco and Anima Visconteo, launched in 1985. Anima Magellano and Anima Vespucci are distinguished by a higher equity component than other products in the family, and by investment in emerging markets. Anima Magellano has an equity proportion of about 50%, while Anima Vespucci is at least 70% invested in bonds.
