CalPERS wins a battle at Apple


Apple shareowners have supported a proposal by the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) that advises the company to adopt a majority vote standard for board candidates in uncontested elections. Proposal 6 at the computer company’s annual shareowners’ meeting in Cupertino, California asked Apple to require a majority of shares to replace the current plurality vote standard for election of unopposed board candidates. The company confirmed that the proposal passed.“As a company that thrives on innovation, Apple should have the best governance practices possible,” said Anne Simpson, the senior portfolio manager who heads the CalPERS corporate governance program. The current plurality vote rule allows shareowners who oppose candidates only to withhold votes, making it possible for election of an unopposed candidate by a single “for” vote.CalPERS owns 2.6 million Apple shares and is the nation’s largest public pension fund with approximately USD230 billion in assets.
