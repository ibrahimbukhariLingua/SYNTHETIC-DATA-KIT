European stock markets hostile to creation of centralised market data register


The Federation of European Stock Exchanges (FESE) on 7 July announced in a statement that it is hostile to the planned creation of a mandatory Consolidated Tape (MCT) which would record market data for all of Europe, and that it would not like to see a limitation on prices. “From our point of view, these proposals will not serve the objective of improving transparency or reducing costs, but will instead represent a serious threat to the competitive environment which the MiFID directive has made it possible to create,” the European stock exchanges claim.= The federation is also making several pledges, among them, that it will make various market data publicly and freely available for final users one quarter of an hour after the trades are completed, by fourth quarter 2010, and that it will offer pre-trade and post-trade market data separately, at reasonable prices, by the end of the year.
