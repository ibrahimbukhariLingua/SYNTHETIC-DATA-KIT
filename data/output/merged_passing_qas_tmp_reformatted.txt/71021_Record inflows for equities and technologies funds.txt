Record inflows for equities and technologies funds


Equity funds have seen record global inflows of USD43.3bn for the week ending on 14 March, according to statistics from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. US equity funds alone have seen inflows of USD34.6bn. Bank of America Merrill Lynch emphasizes, on the basis of data from EPFR Global, that this appetite for equity funds is in line with a stable Nyse Composite Index since the start of the year.Funds investing in European equities have not been as successful, and have seen USD1.3bn in redemptions. Japanese and emerging market equity funds have continued to benefit from investorsâ€™ favours, with net subscriptions of USD2.9bn for the week.By sector, funds dedicated to technology stocks have posted record weekly inflows of USD2.6bn, for USD9.8bn since the beginning of the year, also an unprecedented record.In bonds, inflows are more modest, with a net USD2.4bn in inflows. High yield bond funds saw a ninth consecutive week of redemptions (totalling USD900m), the longest stretch of redemptions since 2007, analysts at BofA Merrill Lynch note, concluding that this may represent a fragility factor for equity markets.
