AIFM: A clear distinction must be drawn between professional investors and others


In an interview with Les Echos, Noël Amenc, director of the Edhec Risk and Asset Management Research Centre, points out inadequacies and incoherent areas in the planned AIFM directive to govern hedge fund managers. “The main risk is that we might see European managers with an AIFM label taking advantage of very lax national frameworks to distribute European hedge funds, under regulations that give a false impression of protection,” Amenc says, adding that “the proper regulatory response to promote the growth of alternative management in a secure framework would involve a clear distinction between professional investors and others. The former would be allowed to invest without restriction in offshore and onshore funds via a European private investment regime, while the latter would be allowed to invest only in onshore funds which carry a European passport.”
