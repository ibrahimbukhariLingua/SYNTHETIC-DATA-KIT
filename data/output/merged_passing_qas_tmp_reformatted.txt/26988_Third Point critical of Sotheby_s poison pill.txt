Third Point critical of Sotheby’s poison pill


The hedge fund management firm Third Point LLC has threatened Sotheby’s with a “proxy fight” if the auction house maintains a clause adopted on Friday which forbids any active shareholder from controlling more than 10% of capital; passive shareholders may hold up to 20% of capital, however, without triggering the mechanism. Third Point most recently held 9.3% of Sotheby’s.The CEO of Third Point, Dan Loeb, accuses Sotheby’s of having been too slow to adapt to movements in the art market towards contemporary works, online sales and the emergence of buyers from China and the Middle East.Third Point is seeking to obtain the removal of the CEO of Sotheby’s, William Rupprecht, and a seat on the board for Loeb.
