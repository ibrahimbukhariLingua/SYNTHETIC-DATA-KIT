p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Former partners from BlackRock, Macquarie and Millennium Capital Management are prearing to launch their own hedge fund, based in Hong Kong, which will use IT models to seize trading opportunities on 13 Asian stock markets. The new company, entitled Zentific Investmet Management, was founded by Christopher Lee, previously head of the scientific active equity department at BlackRock in Hong Kong and a member of the investment board at the Pan Asia Opportunities fund, and by Burke Lau, former head of quant research for Asia and Japan at Macquarie Securities. The two will be joined by a research team and professional programmers, while the activity will be led by Michael Friedlander, former head of operations and technology in Asia for Millennium Capital Management.Zentific Investment management is planning to launch its own vehicle, the Pan Asia Market Neutral Fund, in early 2015. Its seed capital will come from institutional clients and founding partners. The new structure also has the financial support of HS Group, an investment company based in Hong Kong, which provides long-term capital to new hedge funds in Asia. In a statement, HS Group has also announced an investment in the capital of Zentific, for its second investment since its launch, without revealing the total sum. The first investment by HS Group was in September 2014, when the group invested in the Pleiad Asia Fund.
