Mitsubishi launches a British commercial real estate fund


Mitsubishi has launched an investment fund specialised in commercial real estate in London, which may raise up to GBP500m from institutions in Japan, the Financial Times reports. The Japanese group has teamed up with UBS in the venture, and will supply GBP50m in seed funding. The fund may earn net returns of 8-10% per year, or about 13 times more than Japanese government bonds, according to Tak Ishikawa, CIO of the asset management division of Mitsubishi.
