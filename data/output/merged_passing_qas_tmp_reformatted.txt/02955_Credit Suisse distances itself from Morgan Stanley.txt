Credit Suisse distances itself from Morgan Stanley


In a clear allusion to a press statement from Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investment GmbH announcing the results of an audit of the open-ended real estate fund P2 Value, which revealed significant declines in the value of the portfolio (see separate article in today’s edition), Credit Suisse points out that the CS Euroreal fund, which reopened to redemptions on 30 June (see Newsmanagers of 26 June and 10 July) has completely different characteristics in terms of allocation by country, type of real estate assets, and age of properties in the portfolio.The fund management firm on Monday night emphasized that an audit of nearly 90% of assets in the portfolio in the first nine months of the current fiscal year (which will end on 30 September) revealed a need to correct the valuation of the fund slightly upward. Credit Suisse also points out that for 2009 as a whole, its projections of returns of over 4% have been confirmed (as returns have totalled 4.3% for the twelve months to the end of June). Lastly, the successful reopening of the fund to redemptions suggests that a wave of subscriptions may be expected, which would allow for “a targeted anticyclical extension” of the real estate portfolio.
