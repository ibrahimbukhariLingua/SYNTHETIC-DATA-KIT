Italian tax amnesty leads to repatriation of assets from Ticino canton


On the basis of figures from the Bank of Italy, Franco Citterio, director of the association of bankers in the Swiss canton of Ticino (ATB), says that Italians at the end of February “legalised” EUR85bn in undeclared assets deposited abroad, of which EUR60bn came from Switzerland, largely from Ticino, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung reports. But of this total, only EUR25bn actually returned to Italy. Many banks, such as the Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI) and Banca del Sempione, for example, were able to recuperate a large amount of the funds which were eligible for this tax amnesty, either through Italian affiliates, or through “legal repatriation.” Eventually, the fiscal amnesty offered by the Italian finance minister, Guilio Tremonti, did not achieve its other objective which was to draw assets out of the Swiss financial centre in Lugano.
