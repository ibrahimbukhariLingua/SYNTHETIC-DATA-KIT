Dexia AM launches a new UCITS III fund


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Dexia Asset Management on 16 November announced a new fund, bringing its product range to 24 funds. Dexia Global Alpha is based on a global macro investment process which seeks to exploit potential returns detected for several diversified asset classes (equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities), largely in Europe, North America, and Asia. The objective of the fund is to obtain substantial performance beyond the Eonia, with average volatility of about 6%, on a recommended investment horizon of 3 years. Dexia Global Alpha seeks to capture potential sources of returns in various asset classes and geographical regions. These returns correspond to the average performance over and above the risk-free rate for a given strategy. These premiums may come, for example, from dividends, reinvested profits, bond coupons, the return differential between currencies, etc. “Our management team has identified about 20 potential sources of returns which may be exploited via two types of strategies: long exposures, for example, to equities indices, government bonds from G20 countries, credit and commodities indices; and long and/or short arbitrage strategies based on a single asset class, in order to profit from macroeconomic, financial or market imbalances,” says Fabrice Cuchet, head of alternative management at Dexia AM. “Concretely, our fund is exposed to interest rate portage strategies, global currency portage strategies, premiums earned on the sale of options on equities indices, fixed income or currencies, and trend-tracking strategies, in order to profit from market excesses and behavioural bias,” says Charles-Henry de Courcel, manager of the fund.
