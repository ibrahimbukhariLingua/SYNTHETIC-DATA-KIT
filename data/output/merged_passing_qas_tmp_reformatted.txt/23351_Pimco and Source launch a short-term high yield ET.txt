Pimco and Source launch a short-term high yield ETF


The investment firm Pimco and the ETP provider Source on 19 March announced the launch of the Pimco Short-Term High Yield Corporate Bond Index Source ETF (STHY). The fund is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and aims to reproduce the performance of the BofA Merrill Lynch 0-5 Year US High Yield Constrained index. STHY is licensed for sale in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Austria, France, Finland, Germany, Italy (only to institutional investors), the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.STHY is the first ETF available in Europe to offer investors physical access to the short-term high yield bond sector. Exposure to the high yield sector is often used as an alternative to equity markets. Returns on the short-term segment of the high yield market historically are equivalent to those of the equity markets, but offer two timss lower volatility.The index selected for the ETF includes a wide range of issuers and bonds (821 securities as of 29 February 2012), which allows Pimco to rely on its experience and expertise in the optimisation of portfolios and high yield investment internationally. The Pimco optimisation process aims to minimise tracking error compared with the index, reduce trading costs, and avoid exposure to bonds considered illiquid, and issuers whose long-term viability is uncertain, while concentrating on the objective of replicating the index. These issuers generally represent a small proportion of the high yield universe.The Pimco Short-Term High Yield Corporate Bond Index Source ETF is the sixth fund launched in the physically invested Pimco Source ETF range, which includes the MINT strategies, which are the first actively-managed ETFs in Europe, and the first bond ETFs which weight the various countries according to the GNP so as to provide an optimised reproduction of local currency and European currency emerging market government bond indices.
