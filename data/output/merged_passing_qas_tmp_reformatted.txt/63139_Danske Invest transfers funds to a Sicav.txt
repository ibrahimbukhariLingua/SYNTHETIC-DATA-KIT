Danske Invest transfers funds to a Sicav


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Danske Invest will transfer 20 funds to a Luxembourg-registered Sicav. The funds have previously been in FCP format. The Danish asset management firm explains that in light of some legal and fiscal reforms in some jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, ownership and sales of FCPs has become less attractive to investors.

The funds affected by the changes are the following: • Danske Invest – Danish Bond • Danske Invest – Danish Mortgage Bond • Danske Invest – Denmark Focus • Danske Invest – Europe Focus • Danske Invest – Europe High Dividend • Danske Invest – Europe Small Cap • Danske Invest – European Bond • Danske Invest – Global Corporate Bonds • Danske Invest – Nordic • Danske Invest – Swedish Bond • Danske Invest – China; • Danske Invest – Eastern Europe ex.
