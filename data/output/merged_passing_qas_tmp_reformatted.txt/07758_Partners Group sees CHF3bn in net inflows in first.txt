Partners Group sees CHF3bn in net inflows in first half


On Tuesday, the Swiss firm Partners Group announced that in first half it has registered net subscriptions of CHF3bn, compared with CHF2.2bn in July-December 2009, and CHF1.4bn in the corresponding period of last year. Assets as of 30 June, for their part, totalled CHF26.5bn, as negative currency effects due to the depreciation of the Euro against the Swiss franc accounted for CHF1.8bn. Though Partners Group accounts are denominated in Swiss francs, 70% of activities are undertaken in Euros, compared with 25% in US dollars, and 5% in other currencies. Urs Wietlisbach, co-founder and vice chairman, says that Partners Group, which has already announced plans to open an office in Dubai (see Newsmanagers of 28 May 2010), is also planning to open an office in Latin America, and one in Asia.
