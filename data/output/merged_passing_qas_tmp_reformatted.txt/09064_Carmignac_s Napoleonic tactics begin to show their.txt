Carmignacâ€™s Napoleonic tactics begin to show their limitations


The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports that, although the Carmignac Patrimoine fund, which underwent a rapid growth spurt, bringing its assets to EUR16.5bn, up from EUR10bn nine months earlier, is still one of the best mixed fund selection products, it is no longer the outright leader, with returns of 15%, while competing funds are earning gains of 30% or more. The large size of the fund is certainly a handicap, as Carmignac is no longer as free in its choice of investments as its was in the past. As soon as it enters an investments, it must plan how it is getting out of it. Its aggressive tactics are beginning to reach their limits, but it is not yet a foregone conclusion that the campaign will end in a defeat reminiscent of Waterloo.
