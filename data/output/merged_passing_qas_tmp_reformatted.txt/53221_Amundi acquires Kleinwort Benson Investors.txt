Amundi acquires Kleinwort Benson Investors


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Amundi has announced that it has signed a final agreement to acquire an 87.5% stake in KBI from Oddo & Cie. The management team at KBI will hold the remainder of capital, at 12.5%, a statement says. KBI is an asset management firm specialised in equity management, an affiliate of BHF Kleinwort Benson Group, acquired recently by the Oddo group. The structure is based in Dublin, Ireland, and has offices in Boston and New York. It has 62 employees, and managed EUR7.6bn in assets as of 31 March 2016, largely in global equity strategies. In terms of clients, it is balanced between institutional investors, outsourced management and third-party distributors. The firm has successfully developed in North America, where 52% of its clients are domiciled in terms of assets under management, while Ireland and the United Kingdom together represent 26%, continental Europe 14%, and Asia 8%. In 2015, KBI announced earnings of EUR31m, and net profits of EUR9m. “Amundi and KBI are very complementary in terms of products and geographical regions: expertise in global equities from KBI will noticeably strengthen the equity management product range from Amundi; in exchange, KBI will benefit from the commercial presence of Amundi serving institutional and retail clients in Europe, Asia and the Middle East,” a statement says. Sean Hawkshaw and Noel O’Halloran will remain as CEO and chief investment officer, respectively. All teams are expected to remain in place.
