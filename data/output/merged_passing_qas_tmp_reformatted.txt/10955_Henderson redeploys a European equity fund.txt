Henderson redeploys a European equity fund


The Continental European Equity Fund (LU020915757), a sub-fund of the Luxembourg Sicav Henderson Horizon, has been renamed, under an application submitted on 7 October, to become the “Euroland Fund” (LU0011889846) as of 8 November, and at the same time the investment strategy of the manager is being changed. As the new name of the fund indicates, the portfolio will now focus on solid and undervalued equities from euro zone equities, rather than on continental Europe. The euro-denominated product will invest at least 75% in shares in businesses domiciled in the euro zone, or which realise most of their activities there. The benchmark index will now by the MSCI EMU Net Return Index, instead of the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index. The new manager is Nick Sheridan, who replaces Paul Casson. As of the end of September, assets in the fund, launched in July 1984, totalled EUR46.18m.
