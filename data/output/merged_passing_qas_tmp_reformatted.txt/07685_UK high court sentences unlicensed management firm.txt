UK high court sentences unlicensed management firm


A verdict of the United Kingdom high court on Wednesday, 21 July required an immediate payment of GBP3.717bn to compensate investors in a collective investment fund managed by Upton & Co. The business was also sentenced to pay GBP10,000 per month – lower than the GBP840,000 sought – to investors. The management firm based in Wakefield, which had no license from the FSA, the British market regulatory authority, managed a “Currency Plan” fund, which promised high returns via investments in currency markets.
