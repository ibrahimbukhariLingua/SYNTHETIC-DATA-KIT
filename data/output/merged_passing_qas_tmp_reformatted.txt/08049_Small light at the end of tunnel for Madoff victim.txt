Small light at the end of tunnel for Madoff victims


La Tribune reports that investors seeking to put an end to their involvement in the Madoff caper may sell their fund shares. Although the products are effectively worthless now, and most of them have entered liquidation, the Hedgebay Trading cross-border platform offers a way to put sellers and buyers of shares in the funds in contact. According to the newspaper, as much as USD5m in trades on the Fairfield and Plazza hedge funds are reportedy taking place. Some institutional investors have even approached the platform to buy illiquid shares “transparently.” The new owners of the shares are hoping that Irving Picard, the US liquidator of Bernard Madoff’s assets, will recover more money than expected. The unfortunate investors selling their shares will also have the relief of recovering some limited amount. The platform reports that the rebound in trading of these shares has brought their value back up to only 8% of the value of the initial investment.
