LLB Vaduz signs a non-prosecution agreement with the United States


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The US Department of Justice (DoJ) and the south district court of New York have signed a non-prosecution agreement with the Liechtensteinische Landesbank (LLB), by which the Liechtenstein bank agrees to pay USD23.8m as a fine under previously determined ad-hoc conditions.The agreement concludes several months of negotiations concerning an investigation by the US authorities into knowing whether LLB Vaduz clients violated US tax and/or market regulations, and if the bank itself may have been implicated in these deeds.By the agreement, the US authorities expressly foreswear any legal action and any subsequent fines.LLB states that it will now continue talks to obtain a settlement of the same type for LLB (Schweiz) AG, the Swiss affiliate, as well as for swisspartners Investment Network. These firms have already built up cash reserves to confront any administrative reviews of their accounts for first half 2013 and 2012.
