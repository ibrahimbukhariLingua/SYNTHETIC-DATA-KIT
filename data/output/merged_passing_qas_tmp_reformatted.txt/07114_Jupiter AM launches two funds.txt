Jupiter AM launches two funds


Jupiter Asset Management is to launch two funds on 1st October 2010. The Jupiter Strategic Total Return fund and the Jupiter Global Convertibles fund, which have been authorised by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) and registered with the Financial Services Authority (FSA), will be UCITS III sub-funds of the Luxembourg-domiciled Jupiter Global Fund Sicav which is registered in a number of jurisdictions across Europe and Asia. Both funds will be managed by Miles Geldard and Lee Manzi, who recently joined Jupiter from RWC Partners. The two fund managers have worked together for 12 years and have 40 yearsâ€™ combined investment experience. The Jupiter Strategic Total Return fund will aim to generate positive long term returns across varying market conditions, from an actively managed portfolio of different asset classes, including equities, bonds, convertible bonds, currencies and money market securities on an international basis. The Jupiter Global Convertibles fund aims to achieve long term capital growth through investment in a portfolio of convertible bond securities on a global basis. It is a long only fund which will seek to maximise the asymmetric return characteristics of the asset class. It will be diversified globally and can invest in any country, industry sector, credit rating or market capitalisation.
