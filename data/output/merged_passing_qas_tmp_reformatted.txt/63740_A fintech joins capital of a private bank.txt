A fintech joins capital of a private bank


A world turned upside down: at a time when many banks have recently been acquiring companies specialised in financial technologies with relative frequency, the opposite has just occurred. The fintech Net 1 UEPS Technologies, listed on Nasdaq, has acquired a 30% stake in the capital of the private bank Bank Frick & Co, based in Liechtenstein. Net 1 is a provider of solutions for transaction processing, mobile payments, and online transactions.The capital participation strengthens a pre-existing partnership between the two firms, who thus hope to accelerate development of the activities of the bank in wealth management, payment services, and real estate.
