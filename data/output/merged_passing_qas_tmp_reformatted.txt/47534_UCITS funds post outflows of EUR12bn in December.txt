UCITS funds post outflows of EUR12bn in December


UCITS registered net outflows in December of EUR 12 billion, compared to net inflows of EUR 27 billion in November, according to the European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA). This turnaround came on the back of net outflows from fixed-term funds during the month. Net sales of bond funds recorded net outflows of EUR 1 billion compared to net inflows of EUR 11 billion in November. “For the first time in 2014, demand for bond funds turned negative in December in a historically low interest rate environment where investors are searching for higher yield and protection against interest rate risk,” commented Bernard Delbecque, director of economics and research.Net sales of equity funds broke-even during the month, compared to net inflows of EUR 2 billion in November. Balanced funds recorded a second consecutive month of net sales of EUR 13 billion. Long-term UCITS (UCITS excluding money market funds) registered net sales of EUR 16 billion, compared to EUR 31 billion in November. Money market funds registered large net outflows of EUR 28 billion, which can largely be attributed to cyclical end-year withdrawals. Total net sales of non-UCITS remained steady in December at EUR 16 billion. Special funds (funds reserved to institutional investors) net sales increased to EUR 13 billion from EUR 12 billion in November. Total net assets of UCITS increased 0.2 percent in December to EUR 8,038 billion, whilst non-UCITS assets grew by 0.6 percent to EUR 3,194 billion.
