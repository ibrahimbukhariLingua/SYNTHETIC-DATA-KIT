German foundations withstand crisis


According to statistics from the German federation of charities (Bundesverband Deutscher Stiftungen), at the beginning of this year Germany had 16,406 foundations, managing wealth of more than EUR100bn. In the course of the year 2008 alone, 1,020 new foundations were founded. This trend highlights the growing interest of high net worth private individuals and businesses in foundations. The crisis has not spared foundations, however. The five largest foundations in Germany, including Robert Bosch, Dietmar Hopp and Volkswagen, saw a decline of 7% in their assets in one year, to a total of about EUR15bn.
