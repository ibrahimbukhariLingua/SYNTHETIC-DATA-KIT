AllianceBernstein launches Short Duration High Yield strategy in Europe


AllianceBernstein on 11 January announced the launch of the Short Duration High Yield Portfolio (LU0654559516), a fund which invests in high yield securities whose average maturity is under four years, in Europe. In a context which has recently been dominated by a contraction in spreads and an increase in volatility, the new Luxembourg-registered fund will aim for returns on high yield assets which have a more limited risk profile. The portfolio prefers corporate bonds of a rating below investment grade, as well as government and quasi-government bonds from developed and emerging markets. The strategies used to reduce volatility include a preference for short-term bonds, high-quality issuers within the high yield issue universe (excluding issuers rated CCC or lower), and the use of hedging techniques including particular protection against issuers taken singularly, and options on bond indices or interest rates. Research by AllianceBernstein finds that by shortening the duration of bond positions, investors lose relatively little performance over a complete market cycle, but gain some stability in times of crisis. The fund is managed by a team with average experience in the high yield sector of 14 years, and is benchmarked against the Barclays Capital Global High Yield Corporate 1-5 Years.
