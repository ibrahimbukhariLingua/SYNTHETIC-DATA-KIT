CAAM-SGAM to adopt the name Amundi AM


Crédit Agricole and Société Générale on Friday revealed the name of their joint asset management venture: Amundi Asset Management. The announcement of the name is a part of the merger process for the asset management activities of Crédit Agricole (CAAM) and Société Générale (SGAM), “which is proceeding on schedule,” says a statement. The plans were approved in September by the regulatory authorities (Autorité des marchés financiers and CECEI). Pending permission from the European antitrust authorities, Amundi will be created on 1 January 2010, with assets of nearly EUR650bn under management (as of the end of September 2009).
