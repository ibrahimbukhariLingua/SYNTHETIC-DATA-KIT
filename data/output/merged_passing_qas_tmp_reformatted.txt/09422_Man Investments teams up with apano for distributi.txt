Man Investments teams up with apano for distribution


The German financial services provider apano and the UK alternative asset manager Man Investments have agreed to extend their strategic partnership in Austria. They will be opening a branch office together in Vienna, with Thomas Steiner as head of distribution. Steiner was previously head of sales at C-Quadrat, before setting up the fund information website foonds.com for Styria BÃ¶rse. As a part of this partnership, apano will be in charge of monitoring the IFA market and brokerage pools. Retail client assistance will be added to this by the end of the year. The consultant Dirk Herrmann, former head of Fidelity for Austria, will also be involved in setting up the project.
