p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The asset management firm Somerset Capital Management, based in London and specialised in the emerging markets universe, has launched an emerging markets equity fund which will exclude all investments in the tobacco industry. The MI Somerset Global Emerging Markets (ex-Tobacco) fund, which was launched on 20 February, will follow the same investment strategy as the Global Emerging Markets fund, with assets under management currently totalling USD3.2bn. Somerset launched this new strategy at the request of clients seeking to implement an ethical investment strategy. The UCITS fund already has assets of GBP49.5m from a British charity. Due to its ethical approach, the fund is expected to attract bodies of this type as well as local councils and pension fund managers. The strategy will be managed by the cofounder of the asset management firm, Edward Robertson, who will rely on the investment expertise of 17 people bawed in London and Singapore. Assets under management at Somerset Capital Management currently total about USD8bn.
