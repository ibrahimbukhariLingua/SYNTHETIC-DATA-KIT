Switzerland: Signature of tax convention with Singapore postponed


Agefi Switzerland reports that a double taxation convention slated to be signed by Switzerland and Singapore in August is not to the liking of the cantons. At a consultation, the conference of cantonal finance directors were critical of the fact that the city-state of Singapore receives more than the cantons do in administrative exchange. Singapore has not agreed to make this assistance reciprocal. This means that Switzerland would be required to deliver up certain information which Singapore, for its part, refuses to disclose. This is the reason why Switzerland is undertaking negotiations with Singapore, a spokesperson for the federal taxation administration, Thomas Br√ºckner, declared. Further talks will take place by the end of the year. Any agreement could only be signed after this has taken place.
