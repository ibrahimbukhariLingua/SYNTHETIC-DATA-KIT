Luxembourg parliament passes law to cover financial sector in case of hard Brexit


The Luxembourg parliament has recentlypassed fourlaws ahead of a no-deal Brexit scenario. One of the four laws concerns the financial sector, as it grants special powers to the financial sector surveillance commission, the Luxembourg market regulator, and the insurance commissary. These two bodies will be empowered to authorise British traditional and alternative asset management, payment, and insurance companies on a case-by-case basis to continue to provide services to clients in Luxembourg for a period of 21 months following an exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
