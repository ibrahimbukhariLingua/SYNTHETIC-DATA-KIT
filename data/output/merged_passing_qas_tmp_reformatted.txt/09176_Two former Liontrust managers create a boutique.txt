Two former Liontrust managers create a boutique


Jeremy Lang and William Pattisson are planning their return to the industry with a new boutique called Ardevora Asset Management , following their departure from Liontrust almost a year ago, says Citywire. The duo plans to hire two fund managers to run money alongside them and will run long/short UK and global portfolios with absolute return targets between 7% and 10% a year.
