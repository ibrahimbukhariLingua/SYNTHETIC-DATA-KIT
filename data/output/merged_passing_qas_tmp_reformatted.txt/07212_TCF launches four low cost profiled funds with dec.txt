TCF launches four low cost profiled funds with decreasing fees


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } TCF Investment (the brand name of TCF Fund Managers) has announced the launch in mid-October of four Total Clarity funds, profiled products (Defensive Portfolio, Cautious Portfolio, Diversified Balanced Portfolio and Diversified Long-Term Growth Portfolio) whose TER is limited to 0.8%. This TER will be reduced gradually as assets increase, to finish at 0.6% when assets under management are over GBP1.5bn. TCF will pay no commissions to advisers, but will offer them the opportunity to invest in the funds. The products, which will carry no front-end or exit fees, will invest in a variety of low-cost vehicles, largely ETFs available in the UK. They may also invest in shares in institutional funds not available to retail investors, but not in hedge funds. Initially, the Total Clarity Funds will be available on the Axa Elevate, Ascentic, Macquarie, Novia, Standard Life Wrap, Suffolk Life, Transact, SIPP Centre, SIPP Deal and Raymond James platforms.
