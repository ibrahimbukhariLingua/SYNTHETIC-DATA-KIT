EFAMA plans to create Brexit working group


As European management leaders prepare to meet in Paris on Thursday, the European fund and asset management association (EFAMA) has announced that a working group will be created to analyse the consequences of Brexit for asset management in Europe. “We will create this group when the United Kingdom actually triggers article 50 in the European Union treaty to make its request to withdraw from the Union official,” says Peter De Proft, director general of EFAMA.“Negotiations over Brexit are still at a political stage,” says William Nott, vice-chairman of EFAMA, who promises that “altough it does not make the job easier, Brexit will not prevent EFAMA from continuing to discuss with regulators, the Commission and various European governments to create a capital markets union (CMU). … Brexit makes it more necessary than ever to unite and move quickly,” says Nott.The United Kingdom has engaged to implement European directives, including MiFID II.
