UBS revises bonus policies


L’Agefi Suisse reports that UBS, like Credit Suisse, has revised its bonus policies. But it has done so much more discreetly, without informing the media. Partners at the bank were informed in a letter published on the establishment’s web page. Like Credit Suisse, UBS will strongly increase the fixed portion of salaries for its top directors, and will reduce variable pay. Among the other measures which will be taken, bonuses will be tied to the performance of the bank, as measured by profits earned, and this will apply for each division of the firm. Shares received from the bank will be embargoed for three years. Meanwhile, the weekly newsmagazine Sonntag reports that UBS will massively increase the bonuses it pays its employees.
