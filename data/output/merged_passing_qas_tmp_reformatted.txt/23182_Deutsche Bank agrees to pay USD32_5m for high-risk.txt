Deutsche Bank agrees to pay USD32.5m for high-risk loans


Deutsche Bank has agreed to pay USD32.5m to settle class-action lawsuits by investors who accuse the firm of having misled them before the crisis when it sold them shares backed by high-risk mortgage debts. In documents submitted to the New York Eastern District court, lawyers for investors and the bank proposed an amicable settlement which has yet to be approved by the judge, Leonard Wexler.The suit was brought in summer 2008 by a series of institutional investors, largely pension funds, who claims that Deutsche Bank sold them securities backed by real estate loans on the basis of “misleading representations which omitted important elements” about the quality of the credit.
