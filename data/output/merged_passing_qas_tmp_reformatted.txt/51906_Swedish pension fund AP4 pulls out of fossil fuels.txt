p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Swedish pension fund AP4 will invest USD3.2bn in passive investment fund designed by the tracker provider MSCI, which tracks low carbon indices, Financial Times fund management (FTfm) reports. The institution, which has USD35bn in assets under management, would like to “decarbonise” its international equity portfolio (USD14.7bn in assets) by 2020. To achieve this, the pension fund has drastically reduced its investments in polluting businesses and consumers of fossil fuels, and conversely, has increased its allocation to businesses with low carbon emissions. This decision comes in a context of rising pressure on businesses to have low carbon emissions. The decision comes in a context of rising pressure on institutional investors to protect their portfolios against the risks of global warming and climate change.
