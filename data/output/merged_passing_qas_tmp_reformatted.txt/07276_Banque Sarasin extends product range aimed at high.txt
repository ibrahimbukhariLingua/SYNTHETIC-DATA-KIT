Banque Sarasin extends product range aimed at high net worth private clients


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Banque Sarasin announced on 15 September that it has added to its range of offerings for high net worth private clients, with the launch of the Private Solutions brand, which provides global wealth management advising and sophisticated solutions for the needs of non-bankable assets such as real estate properties, participations in private companies, intellectual property and lifestyle assets. The range is aimed to respond first and foremost to fundamental neets in relation to non-bankable assets, such as generating liquidity, improving returns, and reducing risk. Bankable assets, i.e. cash, securities, and precious metals, generally represent only a fraction of the total wealth of European high net worth clients. Most of the assets are located outside the world of banking, and are in principle declared in the country of domicile of the owner of the assets at book value. Real estate properties, stakes in private companies, intellectual property and lifestyle assets are a part of this largely unexploited and attractive realm of assets, the bank says in a statement.
