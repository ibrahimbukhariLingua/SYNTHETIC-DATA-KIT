Pictet offers new “green” product


Philippe de Weck, who is already manager of the Pictet Clean Energy fund, will be appointed as manager of the Environmental Megatrend Selection fund (see Newsmanagers of 29 July). The product will take advantage of the pooling scheme offered by Luxembourg law to invest in four “green” in-house funds: Water (EUR2.32bn), Clean Energy (EUR484m), Timber (EUR84m) and Agriculture (EUR122m). It will have 200 to 240 positions overall. The themes are the same as those of the fund which is already much more actively managed (60 positions) by Arnaud Bisschop (manager of the Pictet Water fund for the past 19 months), on behalf of Union Financière de France, and entitled UFF Capital Planète (see Newsmanagers of 27 July).
