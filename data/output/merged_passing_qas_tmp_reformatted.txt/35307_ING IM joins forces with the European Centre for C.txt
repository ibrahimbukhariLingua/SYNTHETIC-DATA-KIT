ING IM joins forces with the European Centre for Corporate Engagement


ING Investment Management has joined forces with the European Centre for Corporate Engagement (ECCE) of Maastricht University to develop new insights into the materiality of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. During a multi-year partnership, they will carry out three research projects focused on the impact of material ESG factors on investment returns.Material ESG factors are factors that are likely to have a material impact on the (longer-term) sustainability of a company’s business model and its share price performance. Examples include safety standards, shareholder engagement, environmental impact, labor issues, food safety, product liability, governance and alignment between management and shareholders.Hans Stoter, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at ING IM: “This collective effort will help us to further strengthen our investment processes and enable important advances in ESG integration within our industry. We believe that the increased importance of RI and ESG integration brings clear opportunities to all asset managers and investment professionals who embrace this trend.”The research projects will run in cooperation with ING IM’s Responsible Investment, Global Equity Research and Credit teams.
