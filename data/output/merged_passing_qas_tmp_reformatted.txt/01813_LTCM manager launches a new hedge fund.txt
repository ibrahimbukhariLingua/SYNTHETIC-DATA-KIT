LTCM manager launches a new hedge fund


John Meriwether, the hedge fund manager and arbitrageur behind Long-Term Capital Management, is setting up a new hedge fund â€“ his third, says the Financial Times. The move comes only three months after he decided to liquidate his second fund manager, JWM Partners, which was wound down after clients saw the value of their investments fall by more than 44 per cent over the course of the financial crisis.
