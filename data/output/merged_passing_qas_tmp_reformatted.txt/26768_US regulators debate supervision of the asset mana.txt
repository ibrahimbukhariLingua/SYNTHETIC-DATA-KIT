US regulators debate supervision of the asset management industry


The fact that the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a consultation to see if asset management firms pose a risk to the financial system is raising the eyebrows of other regulators, and may provoke a turf war for control of the industry, the Financial Times reports, citing sources familiar with the matter. The move follows the publication of a report by the Financial Research Office into asset management firms. If they are considered to present a systemic risk, their supervision would be transferred from the SEC to the Federal Reserve. This potential turf war could favour the asset management industry, which does not wish to be viewed as presenting a systemic risk.
