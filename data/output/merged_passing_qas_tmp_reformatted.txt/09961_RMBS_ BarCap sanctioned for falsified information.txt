RMBS: BarCap sanctioned for falsified information


The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in mid-week announced that it has issued a USD3m fine to Barclays Capital Inc for modifying data concerning issues of Residential Subprime Mortgage Securitizations (RMBS). Issuers of subprime RMBS are required to disclose information about the track records of securitizations containing mortgages offered to investors, such as RMBS. Default rates in particular are important information for investors in evaluating the value of the RMBS and determining future returns. The FINRA found that from March 2007 to December 2010, Barclays Capital modified the default rates for three subprime RMBS which it sold subscriptions to and sold. The incorrect data published on the Barclays website was identified as historic data for five subsequent investments in RMBS. The errors contained in the information was significant enough to affect investor valuations. To settle the case, Barclays neither admitted nor denied the accusations, but did not obstruct the investigation, FINRA says.
