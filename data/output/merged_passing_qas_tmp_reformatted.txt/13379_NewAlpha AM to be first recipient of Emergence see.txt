NewAlpha AM to be first recipient of Emergence seed capital


As planned (see Newsmanagers of 1 July) the Finance Innovation competitiveness group on 5 July unveiled the first seed money fund for the Paris market, entitled Emergence. The incubation fund will bring together the top managers in the Paris market, to contribute seed money to young asset management firms based in France, or which are hoping to set up offices there, in order to accelerate their development in the first years of existence.Emergence will provide EUR25m to EUR50m to each management firm selected over a three year period; the partnership will last 7 to 10 years.The objective for Emergence is to offer investors a way to participate in the performance of incubated funds (without buying a stake in the capital of the firms), and a participation in future revenues from the asset management firms.Emergence will take the form of a contractual SICAV with sub-funds, which will allow for various investment themes (absolute return, long-only, SRI, corporate bonds, etc.), with appropriate managers contracted to manage them, one per sub-fund, says Alain Leclair, a member of the board of directors at Finance Innovation and honorary president of the French asset management association AFG.The first sub-fund of Emergence will be an absolute return product launched in September (while the second one is expected be launched in early 2012), with NewAlpha AM (an affiliate of OFI) as its contracted manager, due to its recognised experience in this area (incubation for third parties, profit sharing with funds, and OPCVM mutual fund products). About 30 initial incubation targets have been identified. At this stage, the level of capital aimed at for the first sub-fund is EUR150m to EUR250m. According to information obtained by Newsmanagers, commitments already total EUR150m.
