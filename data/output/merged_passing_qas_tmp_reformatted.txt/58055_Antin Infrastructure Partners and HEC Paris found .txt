Antin Infrastructure Partners and HEC Paris found a joint Chair


HEC Paris and Antin Infrastructure Partners, a European venture capital company dedicated to infrastructure, have announced the creation of a joint Chair in “Private Equity and Infrastructure” which will debut from January 2018. “This new Chair will develop a series of studies of practical cases on the basis of investments made by Antin in Europe since its creation 10 years ago, in the energy, transportation, telecommunication and social infrastructure sectors,” a statement explains. The two entities have announced that the Chair aims to address the following challenges: in a context of rarity of public funds, infrastructure financing by venture capital professionals is growing fast in Europe and needs both advanced and polyvalent knowledge and expertise to steer long-term projects with increasingly large scope and complexity. The Chair aims to support excellent academic education and to assist in the practical training of high calibre professionals, raising awareness about the means of creating value used by infrastructure funds in their investments.
