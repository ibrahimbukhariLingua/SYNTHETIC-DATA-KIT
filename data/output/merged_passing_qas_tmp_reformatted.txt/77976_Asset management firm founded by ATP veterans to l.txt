Asset management firm founded by ATP veterans to launch its own fund


Qblue Capital, an asset management firm founded by former employees of the Danish pension fund ATP, is to launch its own fund. It will be a multi-strategy risk premia product in AIF format, which will invest in equities, bonds, commodities and currencies. The fund, Qblue Luxembourg, SICAV SIF, will target international professional investors. Qblue Capital, based in Copenhagen, was founded last October by Bjarne Graven Larsen, former chief investment officer at the Ontario Teachersâ€™ Pension Plan in the United States, and at ATP. He has been joined by a team of professionals who worked together at ATP, including former chief investment officer Fredrik Martinsson and managers Martin Richter, Thomas Stryger Olsen, Lars Voss Toft and Lars Hougaard Nielsen. Kevin Mitchell, a former manager from Kiski Europe AB, is also part of the team.
