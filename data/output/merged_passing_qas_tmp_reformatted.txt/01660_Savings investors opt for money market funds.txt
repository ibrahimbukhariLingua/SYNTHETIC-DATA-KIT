Savings investors opt for money market funds


Spanish clients, in keeping with their tendency to behave as savers rather than investors, preferred less risky investments in October, with net subscriptions of EUR2.2bn to money market funds, Cinco Días reports. This category of products benefited both from an exodus from short-term bond funds, and from new subscriptions: since the beginning of the year, net inflows to money market funds totalled EUR16bn, Ahorro Corporación estimates.
