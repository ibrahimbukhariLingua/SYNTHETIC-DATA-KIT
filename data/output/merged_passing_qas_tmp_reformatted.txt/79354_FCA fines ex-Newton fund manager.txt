FCA fines ex-Newton fund manager


The Financial Conduct Authority has fined Paul Stephany, a former fund manager at Newton Investment Management, GBP32,200 for his conduct in relation to an initial public offering (IPO) and a placing. «On two separate occasions, Mr Stephany submitted orders as part of a book build for shares that were to be quoted on public exchanges. Prior to the order books for the new shares closing, Mr Stephany contacted other fund managers at competitor firms and attempted to influence them to cap their orders at the same price limit as his own orders», the regulator explains. The FCA found that Mr Stephany risked «undermining the integrity of the market and the book build by trying to use their collective power». As a consequence, Mr Stephany failed to observe proper standards of market conduct. He was also found to have «acted without due skill, care and diligence by failing to give proper consideration to the risks of engaging in these communications».
