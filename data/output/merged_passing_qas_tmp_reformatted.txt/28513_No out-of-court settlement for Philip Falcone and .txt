P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } By a majority, including the vote of chairwoman Mary Jo White, SEC commissioners rejected a planned out-of-court settlement which had been negotiationed between the regulator and the hedge fund management firm Harbinger Group, the Wall Street Journal reports.The members of the commission found that the terms were too soft. There had been discussion of a professional bar of two years for Philip Falcone, CEO of Harbinger, and a fine of USD18m.That would have allowed Falcone to continue to lead Harbinger, and the amount of the fine was low compared with the USD113.2m which, in a civil suit, the SEC accused Harbinger of causing damages to its clients by making a personal loan to its CEO in 2009 which allowed him to pay his taxes, at a time when subscribers were not allowed to withdraw their own money from the fund.
