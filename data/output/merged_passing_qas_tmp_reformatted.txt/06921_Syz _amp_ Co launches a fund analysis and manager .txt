Syz &amp; Co launches a fund analysis and manager selection service


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Swiss banking group Syz & Co on Tuesday, 12 October announced the launch of Syz Fund Research, a long-only fund analysis and manager selection service. The service will be headed by Alan Mudie, previously CEO of the Oyster Funds division, and former head of the Swiss activities of FundQuest (BNP Paribas group). SYZ Fund Research is a complement to the external manager selection and control activity for the bankâ€™s fund family. For asset classes which are considered essential (European equities, global equities, asset allocation, absolute return, bonds), the banking group has developed its own expertise. However, the management of other asset classes is outsourced to external managers, making it possible to offer third-party funds to private banking clients and independent managers. A dedicated team in the Oyster division of the firm selects the managers. Due to its good results, it is now becoming a service in its own right, and will have its responsibilities extended. Syz Fund Research will also be responsible for detecting the winning trends of tomorrow, in order to create innovative new investment funds. The appointment of Mudie as head of the service means that he will be replaced as CEO by Xavier Guillon.
