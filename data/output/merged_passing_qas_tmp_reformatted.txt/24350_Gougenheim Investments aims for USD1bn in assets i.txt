A first fund, domiciled in the Cayman Islands, will be launched in June. “The initial size of the fund will be USD50m,” Gougenheim has told the newspaper, adding that the vehicle may eventually approach USD200m, depending on the interest received from invetors. The fund will be based on a global macro strategy.
