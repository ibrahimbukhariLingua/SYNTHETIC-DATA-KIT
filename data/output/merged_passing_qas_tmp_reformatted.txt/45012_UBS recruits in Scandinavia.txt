UBS recruits in Scandinavia


UBS has made several recruitments as additions to its organisation in Northern Europe, particularly in wealth management, the Swedish financial website realtid.se reports. As of the beginning of August, Måns Levin and John Whitlock will join the bank in Stockholm as wealth management client advisers. The two, who will be responsible for ultra-high net worth clients, join from Carnegie. They join Louise Granath, who was recruited late last year as a client adviser, and who had previously worked with Northern European clients at the Zurich office of Morgan Stanley. In Copenhagen, where UBS has recently opened an office, Henrik Wyrwik has been recruited as branch manager. He will work alongside Kim Høgsberg and Henning Sand. In August, they will be joined by Lars Hellum. Both are responsible for high net worth clients. At the beginning of this year, UBS lost three employees to Axa Investment Managers, realtid.se reports. These were David Ansersson, Henrik of Donner and Viktoriak Orhamn.
