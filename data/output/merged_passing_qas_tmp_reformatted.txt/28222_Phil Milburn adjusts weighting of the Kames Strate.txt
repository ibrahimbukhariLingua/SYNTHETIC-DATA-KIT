Phil Milburn adjusts weighting of the Kames Strategic Bond fund


The co-manager of the Kames Strategic Bond fund, Phil Milburn, has reduced his long-term underweight position on interest rate risk, in order to take into account the scale of the recent exodus of investors from bonds, Fundweb reports. Milburn states, however, that his fund, whose assets under management total slightly over USD640m, remains underweight on duration risk, and that this position helped it to get through a period of aversion to bonds.
