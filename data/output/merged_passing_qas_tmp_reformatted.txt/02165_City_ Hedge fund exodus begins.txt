City: Hedge fund exodus begins


The largest UK hedge fund manager, Brevan Howard (USD27bn in assets), has launched a search for an office large enough for at least 100 people in Geneva or Nyon, which could be the first sign of a massive exodus of financial groups from London, the Sunday Times reports. In June, the CEO of Brevan Howard claimed that the planned European hedge fund directive would make it impossible for them to continue their activities in London. In addition, moving to a country with lower taxes would save them millions. Brevan Howard has 100 employees in Switzerland, out of 240 total personnel.
