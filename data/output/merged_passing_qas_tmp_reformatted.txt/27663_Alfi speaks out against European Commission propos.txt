Alfi speaks out against European Commission proposals for MMFs


The Luxembourg investment fund association (ALFI) has become the next body to react to proposed regulations for money market funds, expressing deep concerns about the impact of the measures under consideration.“Money market funds represent 15% of the European investment fund industry. They represent a significant source of short-term financing for the economy. The proposals of the Commission, particularly with respect to assets which are eligible for diversification, are too severe, and even go further than the government rules for UCITS products, which is not justified,” explains Marc Saluzzi, chairman of ALFI, cited in a statement.The additional 3% liquidity cushion required for money market funds with a constant NAV (50% of European money market funds) is also ill-considered, as this type of cushion was originally designed for the banking sector. The investment fund sector is already highly regulated, ALFI says. The cushions envisaged by the Commission are too costly for money market funds with constant NAV, particularly in the current low interest rate environment.
