Anima and Poste Italiane scale up partnership in asset management


The Italian asset management firm and the Italian postal service Poste Italiane have announced a new agreement to “enlarge their partnership in the field of asset management,” a joint statement says.The new agreement stipulates the partial sale of the asset management activities for insurance products of the postal group, totalling over EUR70bn. These will move from Banco Posta Fondi SGR, the asset management firm for the Italian postal service, and will be taken over by Anima SGR.In exchange, Posta will receive newly-issued shares in Anima SGR, which will be simultaneously acquired by Anima Holding for a total of EUR120m. Anima will finance the sale through debt.Meanwhile, cooperation agreements between Anima and the Poste group will be “reviewed and enlarged.” The fisrt agreements, signed in July 2015, specify that Anima is the outsourced manager for retail funds created by BPF SGR, and for the underlying assets for some insurance products from Poste Vita. The changes will include an extension of the partnership, for a period of 15 years.Lastly, through the contribution of Anima, training and upgrading activities for the Poste Italiane sales network will be scaled up. The product range offered will be extended.Poste Italiane retains 100% of BancoPosta Fondi SGR, and aims to make it “a centre of expertise in the management of financial investments for the entire group,” the statement says. This contradicts a previous statement of 10 November, which stated that BancoPosta Fondi would be acquired by Anima.Poste and Anima have been partners for several years, and Poste controls 10.324% of capital in Anima.
