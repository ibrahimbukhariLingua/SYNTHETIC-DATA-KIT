Invesco releases a money market fund


Invesco is releasing a new “American-style” fund in France, called Euro Liquidity Portfolio. The fund, launched in June 2006, is aimed at corporate treasurers and investors, and allows them to invest short-term liquidities. The portfolio, totalling EUR719m, is composed of two parts. One of them, which represents up to 30% of the portfolio, aims to provide continual liquidity, regardless of market conditions. To achieve this, it is composed of securities with maturity dates of 1 to 3 days. The second part is invested in top-quality securities, with residual time until maturity of up to 397 days. These are retained until they mature. In practice, the average time to maturity for the entire portfolio taken together is about 35 days. Securities in the portfolio come from 40 issuers. The fund carries the highest possible credit rating, AAA. Its performance between 31 July 2008 and 31 July 2009 was 2.62%, compared 2.13% for the Eonia, its benchmark index.
