Vincent Passa has left Legg Mason


Vincent Passa, head of the Paris office of Legg Mason, has left the group. The announcement came in an email to clients on 16 May, NewsManagers has learned. The director had led the sales office since 2010. “This does not in any way call into question the engagement of Legg Mason in France. France remains an important market in which Legg Mason will continue to invest,” a spokesperson for the group has told NewsManagers.Although no information could be obtained regarding the reasons for his departure, it comes in a somewhat singular context for Legg Mason. A new organisation was put in place in Spring to optimise sales efforts in continental Europe. Passa in November explained to NewsManagers that the head of sales for Europe, Justin Ede, had extended his responsibilities to cover distribution in offshore Americas and Latin America. The group then decided in Spring to set up two subregions for continental Europe: one for southern Europe, including France, Italy, and Spain, and one for northern Europe, where Benelux, which had previously been with France, joins Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. The Paris office was placed under the leadership of the head of Italy, Marco Negri. But Passa told us that he welcomed this reorganization philosophically. “It allows me to better concentrate on France, and all the more good news are to come for institutional clients. In light of these advanced opportunities, Paris can be expected to cover USD900m in the short term. The new distribution organisation is bearing fruit,” he explained.The Paris office has four salespeople, with two for the French market and two for Benelux. Slightly under 100 UCITS funds from Legg Mason are registered for sale in France.
