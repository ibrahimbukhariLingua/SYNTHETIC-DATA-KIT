Interest in European equities recovers


Flows into Europe bond and equity funds hit six and 66 week highs during the second week of August as initial estimates from Eurostat confirmed the end of a recession that has gripped the European Union and Eurozone since the last quarter of 2011. For the week ending August 14, combined flows into Europe and Europe ex-UK regional equity funds exceeded USD2 billion, according to statistics from EPFR Global. At the country level Italy equity Funds posted their biggest weekly total in over a decade despite the fact Italy is one of four Eurozone economies that did not return to growth in the second quarter of 2013. One that did, France, continues to be viewed with skepticism: redemptions from France equity funds hit a 10 week high. Overall, EPFR global-tracked equity funds recorded net inflows of only USD1.26 billion. Chinese equity funds have seen a net outflow of over USD5bn. Bond Funds saw USD1.38 billion redeemed, while money market funds attracted USD6.53 billion with US funds accounting for the bulk of those inflows.
