Lyxor at work on a real estate ETF


Lyxor is planning to launch a new real estate ETF by the end of the year, according to Isabelle Bourcier, global head of ETFs at Lyxor Asset Management, speaking at a breakfast organised by bfinance. Bourcier also declared that the popularity of ETFs is not a passing fad. “Of course they may be fashionable just now, but in my opinion, the growth of this market is not related to fashion. The ETF market is here to stay,” she said. She adds that the European market has considerable potential for growth. Daily trading volumes on the US market, which now weighs in at about USD400bn, run to USD50bn, while in Europe (for a market that weighs EUR125bn), trading volumes are at about EUR1.5bn. Of course, the crisis has taught the markets a few lessons which it is wise to integrate into investment policies. In particular, it is important to ensure the quality of liquidities, as the crisis has shown the importance of maintaining liquidity in all phases of the market.
