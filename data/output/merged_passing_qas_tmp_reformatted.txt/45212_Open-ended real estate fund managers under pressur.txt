Open-ended real estate fund managers under pressure


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The open-ended real estate fund sector in Germany, in the midst of another crisis not long ago, is again facing a serious challenge: the huge inflows which it has to manage and invest, a survey undertaken by the Berlin-based Scope ratings agency finds. About 80% of suppliers of open-ended real estate funds surveyed in May this year, with a total of EUR68.6bn in assets under management, consider their situation good or very good as a result of capital inflows. In first quarter, net inflows to open-ended real estate funds totalled EUR1.7bn, EUR1bn more than in first quarter 2014. Two thirds of respondents are expecting to continue on this courst until the end of the year. In this context, more than half of respondents are planning to limit the liquidity of funds, and may therefore put cash stops in place. The liquidity level for funds currently totals an average of 22.5%. These strong inflows will result in increased investment activity, according to 60% of respondents, or even additional activity for 20%. This represents a challenge in a context of interest rates which remain very low, creating a highly competitive environnment on the real estate market, where supply is still luckily adequate according to two thirds of respondents. But it is observed that investment in incomplete projects, which already represent one third of total volumes, are continuing to increase this year.
