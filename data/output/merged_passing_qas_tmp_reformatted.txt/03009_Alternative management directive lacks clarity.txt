Alternative management directive lacks clarity


In an interview with Les Echos, Peter Clarke, CEO of Man group, says he supports “efforts to supervise and register fund managers. We are also in favour of a European passport for management firms. The directive, however, lacks clarity in some areas such as leverage, derivative products, and rules for funds of funds … it is essential to measure the implications of the bill for the hedge fund industry in Europe. We feel regulations should not block access to funds when they are appropriately structured. The work consists in determining what is appropriate. But for the moment, some measures in the directive are merely a barrier which makes access to alternative management funds more difficult.” Man Group is also planning to scale up its presence on the US market. “We want to be more active there. Before, the difficulty was that institutional investors in the United States had already selected their partners. But now, the circumstances have changed: it’s a good time for us to make inroads into that market, as investors revise their portfolios and allocation strategies,” Peter Clarke explains to the newspaper.
