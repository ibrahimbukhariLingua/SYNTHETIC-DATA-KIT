Bessent is in the process of setting up a company entitled Key Square Group, which will have seed money of USD2bn from Soros, according to a memo sent to employees of Soros Fund Management. Bessent also appears to have managed the fortune of Soros well, it must be said, with annual returns of 13% in recent years, according to a source close to the firm.
