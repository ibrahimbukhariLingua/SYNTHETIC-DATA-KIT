Bestinver cancels exit fees applicable to funds


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Spanish asset management firm Bestinver on Monday, 2 March announced that from that day it will eliminate the redemption fee applied to clients who unload their positions before one year of permanence. Investors will now no longer be penalised when they decide to withdraw from a fund from the Bestinver range. The asset management firm is responding to one of their investors’ traditional request, it says in a statement. The challenge is far from trivial since exit fees can be as much as 3%. The elimination of this commission will be applied to all investment funds, except for the free investment fund «Bestinver Hedge Value Fund».
