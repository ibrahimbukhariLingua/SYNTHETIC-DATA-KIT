GPIF lays out new compensation structure for managers


The Japanese government pension fund (GPIF), which manages nearly USD1.5trn in assets, has on 12 June presented the details of its new remuneration structure for external managers, whose performance “leaves much t obe desired,” from the perspective of the pension fund. The fund emphasizes that few funds have achieved their outperformance objecftives over the three years from 2014 to 2016, and raises the possibility that managers are no longer correctly setting their outperformance targets, making growth in assets under management a priority beyond their capacity to manage them correctly.Hence the decision to introduce a new compensation structure based on performance, with the introduction of a base commission equivalent to the remuneration for a passively-managed fund, the discontinuation of maximal commissions “in order to better tie performance to commissions,” and performance to be taken into account over the long term, with the signature of multiple-year contracts.
