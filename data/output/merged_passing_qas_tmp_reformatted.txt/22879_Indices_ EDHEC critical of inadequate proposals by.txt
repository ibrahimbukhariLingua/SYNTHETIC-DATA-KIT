Indices: EDHEC critical of inadequate proposals by ESMA


Although it welcomes the fact that the new ESMA consultation document issued in January 2012 extends its range to a more horizontal approach covering all UCITS-compliant funds, rather than focusing solely on UCITS-compliant ETF funds in a more vertical manner, the EDHEC-Risk Institute expresses regrets in its response to the consultation document that the text does not go further in several key areas.Specialists at EDHEC express regrets that the European regulator did not see fit to propose a definition of passive management which could be associated with an acceptable tracking error level. Meanwhile, they are critical of the fact that the ESMA proposal, although it recommends making information on the performance of indices available for free, does not require that all information on indices be published for free, particularly the composition history of the indices. Furthermore, EDHEC would like to see the quality of governance of indices and a way to audit the decisions of index committees receive more attention from the regulator.
