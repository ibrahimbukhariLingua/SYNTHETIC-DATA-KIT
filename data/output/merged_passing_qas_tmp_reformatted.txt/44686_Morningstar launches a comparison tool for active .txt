Morningstar launches a comparison tool for active and passive management


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The index and research provider Morningstar on 25 June launched the Active/Passive Barometer, to assist investors to better estimate the relative performance of US fund managers compared with their counterparts specialised in passive management. Among the findings of this initial barometer, based on data as of the end of 2014, is that actively-managed funds underperformed their passively-managed equivalents in virtually all asset classes and all Morningstar categories taken into account in the study, especially over a 10-year period. The mortality rate for actively-managed funds was also higher. The only exception to this general failure was US midcaps which had a success rate over 10 years of over 50%. Low-cost actively-managed funds had better chances of survival and of performance than higher cost actively-managed funds, from a long-term perspective, but low-cost actively-managed funds had lower average annual returns than passively-managed funds on average in nine of the 12 Morningstar categories. Over three-year and five-year periods, 72.9% and 69.7% of mid-term, actively managed bond funds, respectively, beat their passive competition, which is far better than the performance of US equity funds. In the US equity sector, no category has a success rate of over 50% for three-or five-year periods.
