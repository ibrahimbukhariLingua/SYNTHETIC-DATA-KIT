p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } The Netherlands-based asset management firm Robeco on 7 June announced the launch of the Robeco QI Multi Factor Multi Asset fund, a new vehicle which combines “the factoral expertise of Robeco in a multi-asset class solution.” The fund has a long-term target risk profile, in line with a traditional profile composed of 60% equities and 40% bonds, the asset management firm states. Its objective is to generate additional returns through tactical allocation and global stock picking. The strategy is based on six factors: value, momentum, low risk, quality, carry and flow. The fund will be managed by the quantitative allocation team at Robeco, led by Guido Baltussen and Pim van Vliet. The Robeco QI Multi Factor Multi Asset fund is domiciled in Luxembourg, and is available to institutional and retail investors and wholesale distributors in the main Robeco markets.
