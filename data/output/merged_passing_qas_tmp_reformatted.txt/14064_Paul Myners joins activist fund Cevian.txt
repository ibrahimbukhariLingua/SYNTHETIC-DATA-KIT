Paul Myners joins activist fund Cevian


Lord Myners, the former Gartmore chairman who always pushed institutional investors to engage more with the boards of directors at companies, will be joining the largest activist fund in Europe, Cevian Capital, as UK chairman, the Financial Times reports. Lord Myners will help Cevian to identify investment targets, to work with the boards of directors at businesses, and to team up with other investors. Assets under management by the Swedish-based fund, which has been present in the UK since 2009, total about EUR3.5bn.
