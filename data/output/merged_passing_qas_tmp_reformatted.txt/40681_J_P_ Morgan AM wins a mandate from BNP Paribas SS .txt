J.P. Morgan AM wins a mandate from BNP Paribas SS for “asset management firm” passport


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } J.P. Morgan Asset Management has announced that it has “successfully” implemented the asset management firm passport in Luxembourg and France, and selected BNP Paribas Securities Services as its depository and valuator for the management of its first French-registered fund with this model. The new contract strengthens the historic partnership between BNP Paribas and J.P. Morgan Asset Management. In order to develop fund distribution in France to French institutionals, the asset management firm already relies on the capacity of BNP Paribas to offer global solutions, providing local expertise and proven experience in the area of risk management, via a dedicated “Fund hosting” product. With the implementation of this passport, the bank offers a new solution to assist asset management firms with their international distribution. “France is the first country where we has put in place this passport created by the UCITS IV directive, in order to offer our clients a range of locally-registered products which benefit from integrated management and a French depository,” explains Jon Griffin, manager at JPMorgan Asset Management (Europe) SARL.
