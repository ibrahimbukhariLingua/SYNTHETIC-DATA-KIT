Deutsche Bank in exclusive talks with Belgium’s RHJ International to sell BHF Bank


The largest German bank, Deutsche Bank, on 7 July announced that it is in exclusive negotiations with the Belgian financial services company RHJ International for a sale of its affiliate BHF Bank. Deutsche Bank, which acquired BHF Bank with its acquisition of Sal. Oppenheim in 2009, last year announced that it was no longer planning to sell off the entity, after efforts to sell the firm to Liechtenstein’s LGT failed.Deutsche Bank says in a statement that BHF Bank is “one of the best-known brands in German finance, with a long tradition in asset management, wealth management, financial markets, and business banking.”Deutsche Bank claims that the planned operation would allow the Belgian holding company to add to the offerings from its affiliate Kleinwort Benson. That business, which is active in Great Britain, has similar activities to those of BHF Bank.As of the end of 2010, BHF Bank had about EUR43bn in assets, and employed about 1,500 people worldwide. It is present in Germany especially, and also in Luxembourg and Switzerland. It also has offices in Abu Dhabi, Egypt, and Vietnam.
