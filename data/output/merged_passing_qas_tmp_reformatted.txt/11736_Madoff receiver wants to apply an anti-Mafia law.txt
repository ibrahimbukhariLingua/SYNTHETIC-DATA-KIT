Madoff receiver wants to apply an anti-Mafia law


The Wall Street Journal reports that David Sheehan, the lawyer for Irving Picard, court-appointed receiver for the business interests of Bernard Madoff, is now seeking to convince the US District Judge Jed Rakoff that there are grounds to apply the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), which had originally been designed to be used against the Mafia and drug gangs. The RICO law allows victims to seek triple the damages they underwent. In the event, this would mean three times USD19.6bn, although the total losses have since been revised down to USD17.3bn.Picard is thus seeking USD59bn from Madoff, his accomplices, and beneficiaries of his Ponzi scheme. He is targeting UniCredit and the Austrian banker Sonja Kohn, among others. According to Picard, Kohn, who founded Bank Medici in Vienna, channeled USD9bn to Madoff via 6 feeder funds and secret or illegal channels since 1985.
