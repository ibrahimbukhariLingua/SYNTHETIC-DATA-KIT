Tikehau IM sets up an affiliate in Singapore


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; }a:link { } Tikehau Investment Management (Tikehau IM) has accelerated its international development. In a major step in its development, the asset management firm has announced the opening of an office in Singapore. Tikehau IM Asia, an affiliate of Tikehau IM, will have the status of asset management firm, as soon as the authorities issue its license. The Singapore-based firm, which will aim at institutional investors as its priority, is led by Suresh Withana, founder of the hedge fund Harmony Capital. Two people in the Paris office will be moved to Singapore in October to assist him. “The internationalisation of our activities is a strong desire of the group. And Singapore will be a first step in our development in Asia, which is a market with strong potential which we are following very closely,” Bruno de Pampelonne, chairman of Tikehau IM, commented. Other offices are expected to be opened in the region on the future. For now, international activities represent less than 20% at Tikehau IM, which has a total of EUR3bn under management. Tikehau IM would also like to support its growth in European markets. “Considerations are currently in progress to open offices in Spain or Brussels,” says de Pampelonne. At the Tikehau group, international activities are also taking on a larger scale. After London, where the group has had an eight-member team for one and a half years, dedicated to private debt in particular, an office may be opened in Milan, Italy in 2015. This would be led by Luca Bucelli, who joined the Tikehau group to develop all of its activities in Italy.
