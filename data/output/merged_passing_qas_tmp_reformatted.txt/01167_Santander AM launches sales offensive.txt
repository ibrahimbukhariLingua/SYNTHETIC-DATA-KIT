Santander Asset Management will reward clients who invest liquidity via the online banking network Openbank and Banesto until the end of the year. In the case of the first of the two distribution channels, the asset management firm will match 3.5% of subscriptions to the Santander Acciones Euro, and 3% for subscriptions to the Mixto Renta Fija 90/10, for investments between EUR3,000 and EUR200,000. The investor must pledge to leave the money in the funds for at least 12 months. For Banesto subscribers, Santander AM will offer a 1% supplement to subscriptions to diversified funds, up to a total reward of EUR1,500.
