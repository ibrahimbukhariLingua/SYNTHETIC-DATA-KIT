Filippo Madonia and Paul Keogh will be responsible for covering Scotland and south-east England, respectively. They will place the emphasis more particularly on the independent financial adviser sector, in which RLAM is seeking to accelerate its development. Madonia joins from M&G Investments, where he had served as director of development for Scotland and Northern Ireland. He had previously worked at Prudential, Prudential Assurance and Friends Provident. For his part, Keogh had previously worked at Premier Asset Management as business development consultant for south-east England. Over his career, he has also served at Kames Capital and Cofunds. Madonia and Keogh will both report to Phil Reid, head of wholesale at RLAM since his arrival at the firm in March 2016.
