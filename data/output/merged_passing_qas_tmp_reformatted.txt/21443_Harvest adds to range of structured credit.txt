Harvest adds to range of structured credit


Gregory Park, former head of securitisation products in Asia for Deutsche Bank, has signed a partnership with the asset management unit of the Chinese asset management firm Harvest Fund Management, to launch an Asian structured credit fund, Asian Investor reports. The new structure, Harvest Northstone Capital, will take the form of a joint venture between Harvest Alternative Investment Group and the team which has been working with Park since 2010. The joint venture will make mezzanine or high yield investments in debt from SMBs in the Asian consumer sector. The partners will seek to raise USD150m for their first fund.
