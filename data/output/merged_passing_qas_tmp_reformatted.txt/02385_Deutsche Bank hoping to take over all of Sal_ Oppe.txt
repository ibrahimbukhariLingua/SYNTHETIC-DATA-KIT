Deutsche Bank hoping to take over all of Sal. Oppenheim by 2011


Deutsche Bank and Sal. Oppenheim on Sunday declined to comment on an article in Focus magazine which claims that the former firm is planning to acquire an initial stake of 45% in Sal. Oppenheim, and then to buy up the remainder of the private bank by 2011, Die Welt am Sonntag reports. Sal. Oppenheim is now valued at EUR1.5bn-EUR1.8bn, down from the EUR2bn it was recently valued at. Sal. Oppenheim is reportedly also in exclusive negotiations to sell its investment banking operations to the Italian firm Mediobanca. Focus reports that the division also interests Barclays and Macquarie.
