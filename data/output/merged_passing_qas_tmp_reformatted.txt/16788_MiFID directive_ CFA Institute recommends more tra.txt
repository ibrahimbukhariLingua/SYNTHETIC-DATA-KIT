MiFID directive: CFA Institute recommends more transparency and fair competition


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }a:link { } The CFA Institute on 24 January published a new study of questions related to market transparency and the workings of fair competition in the fragmented European equities trading markets. The study was released as part of a consultation over the MiFID directive to regulate markets for financial instruments, which runs until 2 February 2011, and at a time when the market is increasingly fragmenting.The study (http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/ccb.v2011.n3.1), which reviews the structure of European equities markets as well as the regulatory framework applicable to the various types of trading platforms (bilateral and multilateral), concentrates its analysis on the need for transparency on each platform. The report also empirically demonstrates a correlation between high levels of transparency and low trading spreads, a sign that investors would have a lot to gain from increased transparency in trading.The study also estimates that the quality and unity of post-transaction information could be improved, for example, by shortening the deadlines for the publication of information about transactions, as recommended by the CESR, and by setting up a consolidated tape system to collect market data.
