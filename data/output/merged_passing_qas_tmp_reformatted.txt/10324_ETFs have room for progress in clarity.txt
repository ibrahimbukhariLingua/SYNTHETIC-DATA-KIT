ETFs have room for progress in clarity


At a presentation organised by the Club Tocqueville in partnership with Ossiam on ETFs, entitled “Do UCITS-compliant funds present a risk to the financial system and to savings investors?”, Pierre Bollon, director general of the French asset management association (AFG), sought to identify the element that differentiates synthetic and physical replication ETFs, an emblematic debate which calls for more global consideration.He identified several risks, including the risk of what he called “confusionism,” due to the common intermixing of ETP, ETF and ETN products. “We need transparency,” he claimed, “but also clarity. Adding information doesn’t always provide the necessary clarity.” In terms of transparency, the director also noted that the lower the tracking error on an ETF is, the better it is. From this point of view, synthetic ETFs are the best, he says. The AFG director says that a fourth risk is naïve optimism. Bollon was also critical of the role of various regulators worldwide, whose primary goal is to defend the financial systems in their respective countries.Patrick Artus, a member of the economic analysis council that reports to the French prime minister, picked up on this last ideas, pointing out that Basel III, for example, was a rule that would not affect US and Asian banking establishments, for example.Thierry Francq, secretary general of the AMF, gave the key another turn with the observation that for securities lending and borrowing, the rules currently in force were very different from one country to another, but that this problem is not unique to this topic. “There are other examples,” he says. In France, for example, depositories are subject to tough rules, but this is not the case in some other countries. In the Anglo-American countries, he said, regulations are more favourable to the intermediary than in France, which is more careful to protect the interests of the investor.
