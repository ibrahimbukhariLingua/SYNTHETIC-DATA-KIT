Legg Mason looking for a European acquisition


Mark Fetting, chief executive of Legg Mason, wants to turn the US investment manager into a global investment manager. “Now 35 per cent of our assets are held by non-US clients. My goal is to get that to 50:50 or even more,” he said to the Financial Times Fund Management. At the moment he is travelling around the world, meeting shareholders, clients and colleagues, but also window-shopping for potential acquisition targets. He wants to get more capability in international equity, and many of the best international equity investors are based in Europe, many located right here in London. Legg Mason glanced at Pioneer, Unicredit’s asset management subsidiary which is currently on the market, but “I can’t see us being very interested”, says Mr Fetting.
