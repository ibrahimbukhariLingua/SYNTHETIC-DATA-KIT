Marc Krombas (ex-SGAM UK) leaves GLG


fundstrategy reports that Marc Krombas, who managed a fund dedicated to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, left GLG Partners a few months ago. The firm has since recruited Mark Diab as equities portfolio manager for the MENA region. Krombas joined GLG last year when the British alternative management firm acquired Société Générale Asset Management UK, which launched the MENA fund in May 2008, as these markets showed little correlation with the turbulence which affected the financial markets of the developed world at that time. GLG has no comment on the reasons for the departure of Krombas, nor about his plans since then.
