SEB AM sells two properties from ImmoInvest fund


The German management firm SEB Asset Management on 4 April announced that it has recently sold two properties at an “attractive” price, which has allowed it to improve the risk/reward profile for its open-ended real estate fund SEB ImmoInvest (EUR6.38bn), from which redemptions have been frozen since 5 May 2010. The management firm has sold a shopping centre in downtown Salzgitter for EUR34m to Aviva Investors, and a complex with retail (14,500 square metres) and office space (8,500 square metres) in Esslingen for EUR69m, to Rockspring Property Manager LLP. The German financial surveillance authority (BaFin) at the end of March signed a lease for the former offices of PriceWaterhouseCoopers in the Undine building in Frankfurt. The property is in the portfolio of the SEB ImmoInvest fund.
