Adicae accuses Banif of favouring some clients over others


The association of bank, savings bank, and insurance clients (Adicae) has filed a complaint with the CNMV against Banif, the private bank from Santander, accusing it of having apparently given preferential treatment to more than 9,000 subscribers to the real estate fund Santander Banif Inmobiliario, Expansión reports. These investors received redemptions in December, at a time when redemptions from the fund were frozen. The fund declared 51,432 shareholders at the end of December, but only 42,309 in March, Adicae claims.The association adds that 15% of subscribers, theoretically representing EUR614m in assets, got out just before audited figures were published which revised the value of the fund’s assets downward.
