Fund administrators in the firing line


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Are trustees guilty of negligence? Whatever the case, the members of boards of directorrs responsible for overseeing mutual funds are now under pressure, as investors in the United States are widely suspecting that trustees may not have acted in the interests of shareholders, the news agency Reuters reports. Some investors also esitmate that trustees, who often pocket hundreds of millions of dollars per year in remuneration, have been negligent, for example by not passing on economies of scale that could be achieved as funds grew to investors, or by not showing enough rigour in pricing. On the sensitive subject of commissions, a Morningstar study released in 2015 says that assets in the asset management sector had risen 143% over ten years, at a time when commissions rose 78%. These figures would seem to suggest that investors were not treated as well as companies. Lawsuits have been filed, and are still in progress, against giants in the sector including BlackRock and Pimco, who refute the accusations against them. Other actions against firms including Hartford Fund and American Funds were not successful, but did draw some criticism of trustees.
