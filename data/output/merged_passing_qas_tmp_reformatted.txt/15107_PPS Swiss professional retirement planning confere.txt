PPS Swiss professional retirement planning conference special: Vanguard recruits European staff


Since mid-March, the Zurich office of the US management firm Vanguard has been transformed into a Swiss-registered affiliate, Vanguard Investments Switzerland GmbH, Jacques-Etienne Doerr, head of business development for Switzerland, told Newsmanagers at the 3rd annual PPS conference in Geneva. Once the necessary permission has been received from Finma, Vanguard, whose local assets total CHF4.5bn, will be authorised to serve a wider range of professionals (charities, family offices, insurers, private wealth managers), and to advertise its products to this audience, including UCITS-compliant funds and US-registered ETF products. The staff of 3 at the office is expected to double by the end of the year.Switzerland will manifestly not be the sole target of Vanguardâ€™s efforts, as it has redeployed its personnel to other European countries. The Amsterdam and Paris offices have recently been converted into subsidiaries, and the Brussels office has been closed, in order to construct a larger platform in London, where staff has been significantly expanded, beyond the mere integration of Belgian personnel who agreed to transfer.According to the US press, the Vanguard group is planning to actively enter the European market to enlarge its product range, which could involve the release of further products, including additions to its Irish ETF range. But initially at least, products would focus on major asset classes, without thematic specialisations.
