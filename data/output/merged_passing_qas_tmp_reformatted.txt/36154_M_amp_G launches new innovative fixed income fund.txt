M&amp;G launches new innovative fixed income fund


M&G Investments is to offer retail investors the opportunity to protect the value of their bond investments from rising interest rates by opening up a new market to them for the first time.A new fund, scheduled to be launched in the UK in September and then registered across Europe, will invest primarily in the $43.9 billion global high yield floating rate note (FRN) market. FRNs provide a natural hedge against rising interest rates because they pay a variable income which is reset every three months. The M&G Global Floating Rate High Yield Fund will also offer investors an attractive level of income because it will invest predominately in FRN issuers with below-investment grade credit ratings. Investors receive a higher level of income to compensate for the higher risk associated with below-investment grade credit.
