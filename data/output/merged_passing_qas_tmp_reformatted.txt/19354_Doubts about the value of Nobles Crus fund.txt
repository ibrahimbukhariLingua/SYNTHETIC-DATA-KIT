Doubts about the value of Nobles Crus fund


Nobles Crus, one of the foremost wine investment funds in the world, values its assets at far higher levels than those used by ten of its rivals, Financial Times Fund Management has learned. The difference raises questions about precise valuations on the market for fine wines, which has attracted billions of dollars in investment in the past few years. Few wine funds have performed better than Nobles Crus, which was launched in 2008 with EUR2m, and now has EUR109m in assets, FTfm notes.
