SEC steps up surveillance of investment advisers


The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will require investment advisers to provide them with additional information about their activities involving segregated managed accounts. Advisers will be required in particular to provide aggegate data about their use of loans and derivatives, as well as other information concerning their advising activities, including their use of social networks. Advisers will also be required to retain information concerning the calculation and distribution of returns.At a time when several investment advising companies have recently been fined by the SEC (Newsmanagers of 26 August), these measures again illustrate the desire of the US authority to better regulate activities in the asset management sector. “These amendments represent another step as part of the measures we are taking to improve surveillance and regulation of the asset management sector by the SEC,” said Mary Jo White, chairman of the SEC, in a statement. Companies will be required to implement the new amendments by 1 october 2017.
