Nordea has reached an agreement with Norwegian company B2Holding for the sale of a portfolio of non-perfoming loans. Some 12,000 non-perfoming customer accounts, representing €388m of total debt, will be transferred to B2Holding, that operates debt collection company Nordic Debt Collection in Danemark.The transfer will occur on 31 October 2018. Furthermore six employees will be transferred to Nordic Debt Collection on 1 December 2018. Upon completion of the transaction, Nordea is expected to generate a capital gain of around €35-45m which will be included in the financial statements for 2019. “We let professional debt collection companies take over more of the non-performing accounts. Instead we can focus on our prevention work and help our customers avoid debt problems,” said Mads Skovlund, deputy head of Personal Banking, Denmark. B2Holding provides debt solutions to banks and institutional providers.
