Hedge fund lawsuits against Porsche dismissed


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The court of Stuttgart, the city where Porscheâ€™s headquarters are located, on 17 March rejected a lawsuit filed by hedge funds against the luxury auto maker. More than 20 funds, including Viking Global Invetsors, Glenhill Capital and Greenlight Capital, had been suing Porsche following its failed takeover of Volkswagen (VW) in 2008-2009, and were seeking EUR1.36bn in damages and interest. The plantiffs claim that throughout 2008, the Porsche holding company never mentioned its plans to acquire VW, and then quietly entered the capital of its target in order to gradually increase its stake. The announcement of a takeover bid for Volkswagen by Porsche boosted VW share prices, and this rise was accentuated by hedging of short positions. The judge delivering the verdict on Monday found that there was no proof Porsche had acted deliberately to damage the interests of the hedge funds.
