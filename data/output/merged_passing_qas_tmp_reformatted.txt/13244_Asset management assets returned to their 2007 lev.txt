Asset management assets returned to their 2007 levels in 2010


As of the end of December, assets at asset management firms had risen by 8% in one year, to USD56.4trn, following an increase of 13% in 2009 and a contraction of 17% in 2008. Assets thus slightly exceeded their total of USD56.2trn as of the end of 2007, according to the ninth annual survey by the Boston Consulting Group (Building on Success: Global Asset Management 2011).The increase in assets under management is largely due to continued rises on equities markets, while net subscriptions have remained marginal.The sector has also brought its costs under control; these remained at 20% of assets last year. Net margins have increased to 33% from 31%, which remains well below an all-time peak of 39% in 2007.
