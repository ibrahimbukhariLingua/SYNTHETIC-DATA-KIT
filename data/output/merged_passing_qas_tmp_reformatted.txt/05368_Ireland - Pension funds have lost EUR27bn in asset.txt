Ireland - Pension funds have lost EUR27bn in assets


Rubicon Investment Consulting estimates that Irish pension funds have seen a decline of EUR27bn in their assets in 2008, with an average loss of 34.8%. The best manager of the ten large groups studied was Setanta Asset Management, with losses of 29.6%, while the worst was Hibernian Investment, with losses of 38.8%. This is largely due to excessive exposure to Irish equities, which represented 14% of the fundsâ€™ assets at the beginning of 2008, and which lost 65% last year. This allocation alone cost the funds EUR4.6bn in assets.
