Names of ETF funds are too often misleading


In the ETF universe, the name of a product, as long and detailed as it may be, does not necessarily give the correct information about its contents. These are the findings of a study by the US consultant Casey Research (“Top 10 Misleading ETFs”). Casey has created a list of the 10 ETFs with misleading names, which includes, for example, the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Eastern Europe Index Fund (ESR). Unlike what the name would suggest, this ETF does not cover a range of promising countries of Eastern Europe, but is exposed largely to Russia (76%), with 21% invested in Gazprom, 16% allocated to Poland, 4.1% to the Czech Republic and 3.4% to the Hungarian market. Due to the large number of products which sometimes lack transparency in their names, Casey Research emphasises that it is important to select products that are adapted to the needs of investors.
