Singapore sovereign fund invests in UBS


Agefi Switzerland reports that the GIC, one of the two major Singapore sovereign funds, will on 5 March convert a loan it made to the Swiss UBS group into shares in the firm. The CHF11bn, which it lent to UBS in 2007, will give GIC a stake of at least 6% in a capitalisation estimated at CHF59.453bn. This CHF11bn stake has nonetheless lost about 70% of its value in two years, giving it a potential value of CHF5.5bn, though the Singapore fund also holds about CHF2bn in coupons. It appears unlikely that GIC will seek to sell its stake off in the short term, and will be likely to hold it at least until it can break even on its initial outlay.
