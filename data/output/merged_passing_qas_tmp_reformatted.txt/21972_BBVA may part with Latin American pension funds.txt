BBVA may part with Latin American pension funds


On 24 May, the BBVA notified the CNMV that it has decided to study “strategic options for its mandatory retirement savings in Latin America.” Although this is a very attractive area, but has few synergies with the core profession of the group, universal banking, which has triggered a reconsideration of maintaining the activity.Among the options under consideration are a total or partial sale of pension fund administration firms in Chile, Colombia and Peru, and a retirement fund administration firm (Afore) in Mexico, though this will not necessarily mean a sale.The process will most likely take several quarters, and will not be completed before the end of the current fiscal year under any circumstances.Funds People understands that BBVA is already considering several proposals, with assets in question totalling over EUR30bn. Expansión estimates that BBVA could possibly make EUR3-4bn if it succeeds in selling the whole Latam pension fund business.
