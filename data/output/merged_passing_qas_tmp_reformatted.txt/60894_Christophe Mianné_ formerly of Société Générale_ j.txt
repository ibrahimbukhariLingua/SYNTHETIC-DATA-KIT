Christophe Mianné, formerly of Société Générale, joins Primonial


Christophe Mianné, formerly of Société Générale, is joining Primonial on 14 June, and will be appointed as deputy CEO, following the next general shareholders’ meeting of the group. He becomes head of the financial asset management unit, Primonial Investment Managers (PIM). He will also be a member of the executive board.Mianné, a graduate of the Ecole Centrale de Paris, had spent his entire career at Société Générale (SG Corporate and Investment Banking). He had been a member of the board of directors at the group since 2001. He left the bank in late March, a few weeks after the promotion of Didier Valet to the position of deputy CEO of Société Générale, Bloomberg reported at the time.From 1999 to 2007, Mianné led the equity derivatives department and then was director of markets until 2012. Since then, he had been deputy director of the investment and financing bank, the private bank and asset management. He was one of the founders of Lyxor, where he had until recently been chairman of the supervisory board.The arrival of this professional, coming a few months after the entry of Bridgepoint into its capital, is a strong sign of the ambitions of Primonial in the area of asset management. “We have great ambitions in the area of financial asset management both for entities already present in the group and for the implementation of our development strategy for new asset classes,” says Stéphane Vidal, chairman of the Primonial group.The Primonial Investment Managers unit, which Mianné will lead, represents EUR1.9bn, out of total assets at Primonial of EUR17bn.
