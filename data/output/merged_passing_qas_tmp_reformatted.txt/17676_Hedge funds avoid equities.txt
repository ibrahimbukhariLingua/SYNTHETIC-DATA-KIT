Hedge funds avoid equities


Assets in fixed income hedge funds are expected to overtake assets in equity strategies for the first time in the history of the industry, the Financial Times reports. At the end of third quarter, equity and relative value arbitrage hedge funds (which include various bond strategies) represented USD586bn each. “It is highly likely that by the end of the year equities will no longer be the main strategy, and that has never happened before,” predicts Ken Heinz, chairman of HFR.
