Azimut accelerates its development in Turkey


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } The Italian asset management firm Azimut has signed an agreement with Bosphorus Capital Portfoy Yonetimi, an independent Turkish asset management firm, to acquire 70% of capital in Bosphorus for about EUR7.4m. The agreement comes with a sales partnership, as the two firms have decided to work together to accelerate the growth of their activities in Turkey in the mid and long term. Bosphorus, a firm founded in 2011, has about EUR390m in assets under management as of the end of 2014. With this operation, Azimut strengthens its presence in the Turkish asset management market. At the end of 2014, the asset management firm signed an agreement to acquire 100% of capital in the company AZ Global Portföy Yönetimi, which was renamed Azimut Portföy Yönetimi. At the completion of the transaction with Bosphorus, consolidated assets under management by Azimut in Turkey will total about EUR754m, the asset management firm says in a statement. “The comercial and industrial integration of the companies Azimut Portföy, AZ Notus Portföy and Azimut Bosphorus Capital Portföy will create the largest independent Turkish player in asset management, with a diverse range of products and a distribution network that combines proprietary financial advisers and third-party distributors,” Azimut says in a statement.
