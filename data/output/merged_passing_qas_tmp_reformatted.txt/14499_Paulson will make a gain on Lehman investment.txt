Paulson will make a gain on Lehman investment


The hedge fund manager John Paulson made USD4bn by betting against subprime mortgage, the market which precipitated the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings. Now, his fund Paulson & Co. could reap profits between USD350m and USD726m on bonds it bought up at a heavy discount from the investment bank two and a half years ago, the Wall Street Journal reports.
