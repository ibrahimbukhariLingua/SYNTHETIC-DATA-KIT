Morgan Stanley P2 Value to reopen to redemptions


Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investment GmbH is preparing to reopen redemptions from the open-ended real estate fund P2 Value. As the redemption freeze will end before the expiration of two years, the fund will not need to be liquidated, Handelsblatt reports. Walter Klug, one of the MDs of the asset management firm, estimates that after the revision of estimates for all properties in the portfolio, the fund may reopen with assets of EUR820-EUR870m, compared with EUR1.7bn as of the end of October 2008, when the redemption freeze was declared.
