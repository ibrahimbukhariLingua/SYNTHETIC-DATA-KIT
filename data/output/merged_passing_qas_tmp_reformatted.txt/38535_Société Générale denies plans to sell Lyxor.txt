Société Générale denies plans to sell Lyxor


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Société Générale is strenuously denying rumours of a potential sale of its asset management affiliate Lyxor. “It is a strategic asset for the group, and as such, it is not for sale,” the bank says when asked by Les Echos. “We are not selling and we are even potentially buying opportunities that present themselves,” another internal source tells the economic newspaper. According to Les Echos, several causes are driving speculation concerning Lyxor. Firstly, Amundi is seeking to make acquisitions to grow its new ETF franchise, an area in which Lyxor is one of the European leaders. Then, Lyxor has been confronted with a cascade of major departures in the space of two years, including that of its chairwoman, Inès de Dinechin, in February.
