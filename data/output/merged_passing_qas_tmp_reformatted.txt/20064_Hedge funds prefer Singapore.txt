Hedge funds prefer Singapore


The status of London as a top destination for hedge funds appears to be under threat, according to a survey undertaken by the recruitment firm Astbury Marsden, FINalternatives reports. When asked about the preferred location for their activities, 462 British bankers and hedge fund managers placed Singapore on top, with 31% of votes, followed by New York (20%) and London (19%). The British capital comes only slightly ahead of Hong Kong (16%) and Dubai (15%).
