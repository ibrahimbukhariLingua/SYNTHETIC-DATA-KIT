Fidelity goes it alone in retirement planning


Fidelity International has created the website www.fidelity-direktvorsorge.de, a specialist service which offers retail clients direct access to retirement planning solutions, including advising and the opportunity to subscribe to unit-linked accounts such as the Fidelity VorsorgePlan or the Garantie Investment Rente. The range also includes the Fidelity Fondsdepot. These products make it possible to take into account the age, family situation and appetite for risk on the part of each subscriber. The manager had previously offered complete solutions only through products intended to be sold by external insurers. Now, Fidelity International has created an insurance product distribution affiliate in Germany.
