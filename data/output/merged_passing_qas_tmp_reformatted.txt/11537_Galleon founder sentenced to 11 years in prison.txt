Galleon founder sentenced to 11 years in prison


Five months after being found guilty of 14 counts of indictment, Raj Rajaratnam, founder of Galleon, has been sentenced to 11 years in prison, Les Echos reports.The severity of the sentence is a sign of a desire on the part of the US Justice department to crack down on insider trading, and to strengthen oversight of hedge funds.The chief prosecutor on the case, Preet Bharara, an ardent advocate of moral reforms on Wall Street, is thus rewarded for his three years of work on the case. But some observers raise questions about the more favourable treatment that bank heads at the time of the sub-prime crisis received.
