GAM repatriates management of an emerging markets debt fund


Following the acquisition of the bond and currency markets specialist Augustus Asset Managers by GAM, the management of the GAM Star Pharo Emerging Market Debt & FX fund will be brought back in-house, and will be given to Paul McNamara, investment director at GAM. The fund will become known as the GAM Star Emerging Markets Total Return. The fund had previously been managed by Pharo Global Advisors Limited. The outsourcing contract for the management of the fund will conclude on 1 June. McNamara and his team joined GAM following its acquisition of Augustus Asset Managers in 2009. The asset management firm invests in emerging markets debt, and as of 30 April 2011, McNamara managed about USD7.6bn in assets. The fund will continue to aim for total returns 3% to 5% higher than the JP Morgan EMBI Global Diversified Composite index, and will continue to be managed with a top-down macroeconomic style which prioritises active risk management.
