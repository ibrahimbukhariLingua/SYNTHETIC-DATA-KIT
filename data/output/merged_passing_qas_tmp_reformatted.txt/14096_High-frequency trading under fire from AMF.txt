High-frequency trading under fire from AMF


Jean-Pierre Jouyet, the president of the French financial market regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), just before the weekend denounced high-frequency trading’s impact on the wider economy. “The impact of ‘high-frequency trading’ on trading macrostructures has not been adequately studied to date,” Jouyet said in a speech given at the ICMA’s annual general conference.“High-frequency trading leads to rapid changes to order books, at such a pace that between the time when investors make an order and when it is executed, the order has already been changed. This constant instability is a source of concern to investors,” Jouyet explains, and warns that circuits breakers should be put in place, so that processes could be halted to prevent a domino effect from gathering pace. A mechanism “which would allow for moving trading from an autopilot to a manual pilot whenever the pilot wants to take back control of the market seems necessary to me, as has been decided in the United States as well,” the AMF president announced.
