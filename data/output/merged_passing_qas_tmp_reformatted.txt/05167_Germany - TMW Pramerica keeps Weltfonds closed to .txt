Germany - TMW Pramerica keeps Weltfonds closed to redemptions


The Munich-based management firm TMW Pramerica Property Investment has announced that it will not be able to reopen its open-ended real estate fund TWM Immobilieon Weltfonds to redemptions at this time. The closure of the fund took place on 28 October 2008. To keep up with redemption demands, the fund (EUR1bn as of the end of October) will be obliged to sell assets. In order not to sell its properties below their value, the manager has extended its redemption suspension until the end of October 2009, while it retains the option to extend the measure for a further year after that. TMW Pramerica has, however, decided to recommence payment of dividends to retirement plans, but will pay these out of its own capital, and not out of the fundâ€™s assets, in order to comply with a directive from the German financial surveillance authority (BaFin).
