World - Michael Hasenstab (Franklin Templeton) bets on Asian currencies


Michael Hasenstab manages Franklin Templetonâ€™s FTIF Templeton Global Bond Fund fixed income fund. For the coming 3 months, the main performance drivers should be the drop in interest rates, Asian currencies and emerging debt in USD. He explains he is a buyer of Asian currencies because he is confident in economic growth in Asia (ex-Japan), which should in his opinion remain positive, even though it is slowing.
