BlackRock completes acquisition of French firm eFront


BlackRock has completed its acquisition of eFront, which presents itself as the global leader in software for alternative asset management. The group “establishes a new standard for investment and risk management technologies, by greatly extending the capacities of Aladdin in the area of alternative investment to offer a complete portfolio management solution to clients,” a statement says. BlackRock had announced in March that it had made a firm offer and that it was in exclusive talks to acquire 100% of capital in eFront from Bridgepoint and the employees of the firm for a total of $1.3bn in cash. “eFront extends the end-to-end processing capacities of Aladdin to other asset classes, to give clients an overall view of their portfolios,” says Rob Goldstein, chief operating officer at BlackRock. “We are delighted to welcome the 700 employees of eFront into BlackRock, and we will continue to offer eFront as a separate platform, while adding its value to the analysis tools of Aladdin. BlackRock and eFront share the same vision of making alternative assets less alternative, and will work together to achieve that,” he adds. eFront, based in Paris, was founded in 1999 by Olivier Dellenbach. It was acquired by Bridgepoint in 2015.
