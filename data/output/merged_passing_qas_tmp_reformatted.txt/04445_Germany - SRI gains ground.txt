Germany - SRI gains ground


Despite the financial crisis, many funds managed with an awareness of ecological and social criteria have been placed on the market recently. In the German-speaking countries alone (Germany, Austria, Switzerland), 50 new products were launched in 2008, representing total assets of EUR900m, according to the Sustainable Business Institut (SBI). Handelsblatt reports that some sustainable development fund promoters have posted net subscriptions at a time when net redemptions for asset management in Europe totalled EUR300bn, according to Lipper FMI. However, with market effects taken into account, assets in SRI funds fell by one third, a contraction less severe than the average for German equities funds (-38%).
