ALFI critical of Volcker rule and Tobin tax


2012 will be marked by an increase in regulatory pressure, according to the Luxembourg investment fund association (ALFI), which says that it is “particularly concerned” by the Volcker Rule and a proposed tax on financial transactions.At a press conference, Marc Saluzzi, the new chairman of ALFI, claimed that the Volcker rule, in its current form, would create market distortions, and needs to be modified. “At the least, we think that the final version of this law should put European regulated funds on an even footing with their US equivalents,” says Saluzzi. In relation to the proposed tax on financial transactions, ALFI claims the legislation may drag down sales of UCITS-compliant funds outside Europe, and significantly reduce assets in European funds. In order to limit its impact, financial institutions “will make large-scale efforts to move their activities abroad, and/or to increase costs for consumers.” ALFI insists that the proposed legislation could slow sales of UCITS-compliant funds outside Europe, and significantly reduce assets placed in European funds. The impact on the fund sector would be significant, not only due to the high level of tax proposed, “but also because the proposal assumes multiple taxation of the fund portfolio and investors.”
