China fund from Anthony Bolton pays price for two investments


Anthony Bolton has announced that his Fidelity China Special Situations Fund has seen losses due to the fact that two Chinese firms listed in the United States (including China Integrated Companies) in which he had invested have been charged with fraud, Money Marketing reports. The manager says that with his team, he will now dedicate more time to due diligence, having underestimated the risks related to investments in China. Several positions have been liquidated at a loss, including those corresponding to the two companies incriminated in the fraud.
