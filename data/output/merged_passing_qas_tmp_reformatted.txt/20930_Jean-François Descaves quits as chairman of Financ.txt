Jean-François Descaves quits as chairman of Financière de Champlain


Jean-François Descaves on 27 June left his position as chairman and CEO of Financière de Champlain. For nine years, he had led the asset management firm which he founded, and which is now an affiliate of Ecofi Investissements (Crédit Coopératif group). Tristan de Vasselot, currently chief financial officer, will become chairman of the firm specialised in sustainable development. He will continue to serve in his original role in addition to serving as chairman, he has told Newsmanagers. The future development of the firm will be oriented to three major areas. The first is collective management, “which remains our core profession,” the chairman says. The second is development of private management, with the support of the Crédit Coopératif group, which will allocate a part of its private management assets to Financière de Champlain. The third area of expertise will be investment in real assets, via its affiliate Champlain Ressources Naturelles. Following the creation of Foncière Forestière in 2010, Financière de Champlain is preparing to launch an infrastructure project, which will also be in the theme of sustainable development.
