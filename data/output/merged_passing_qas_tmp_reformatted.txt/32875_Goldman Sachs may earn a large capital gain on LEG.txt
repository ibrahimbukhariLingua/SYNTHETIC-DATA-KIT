Goldman Sachs may earn a large capital gain on LEG


An IPO of 57.5% of the German real estate firm LEG Immobilien (90,000 units) is scheduled for 1 February, within a price range of EUR41 to EUR47 per share, Die Welt reports. This means that the RE Whitehall funds from Goldman Sachs, which controls 87% of LEG, and the private equity investor Perry, which controls the rest, may earn as much as EUR1.4bn from the operation, though they paid only EUR800m for the entire firm at the end of 2008. Since then, they have also earned about EUR350m in dividends.At the low end of the price range, the firm is valued at a 10% markdown on its net asset value; the high end of the price range corresponds to a premium of only 3%.
