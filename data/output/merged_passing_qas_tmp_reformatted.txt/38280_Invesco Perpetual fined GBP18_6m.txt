Invesco Perpetual fined GBP18.6m


Invesco Perpetual has had a setback. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the British regulator, has fined Invesco Asset Management Limited and Invesco Fund Managers Limited (Invesco Perpetual) GBP18.64m for exposing investors to excessive risks. The regulator claims that between May 2008 and November 2012, Invesco Perpetual did not respect the investment limits which were set to protect consumers by limiting their exposure to risk. This situation led to losses estimated at GBP5.3m. “These losses, however, may have been higher,” the FCA notes in its statement. The FCA found that the asset management firm violated rules designed to limit risks to investors on 33 occasions, and that these violations occurred across 15 funds from Invesco Perpetual, respresenting more than 70% of assets under management. The regulator also accuses the asset management firm of failing to clearly communicate to investors, “as it did not disclose the use of derivatives in simplified prospectuses, and inaccurately described the impact of the use of these derivatives in information documents produced in 2012,” according to the FCA. The FCA notes, lastly, that Invesco Perpetual failed to register transactions in time, which means that the funds may have been priced badly, and that the firm also failed to control the manner in which the transactions were allocated between funds, leading to risk for some funds which may have been disadvantaged. The local regulator notes hat Invesco rapidly negotiated to solve these problems, reducing its fine by 30%. Without this negotiation, the sanction might have been GBP26.63m.
