Difference between managers getting smaller


Les Echos reports that the Alpha League Table 2009, established by Europerformance-Groupe Fininfo and Edhec on the basis of 2008 performance of products invested in equities, shows that French managers invested in equities added considerably less value in 2008. Alpha is down by nearly 30%, to 1.78% in monthly terms, from 2.5% in 2007 and 3% in 2006. The rankings are topped by Carmignac Gestion, State Street Global Advisors France SA and Comgest SA, but the differences between the leaders in the rankings is smaller than last year. Management firms for insurance companies have withstood the downturn more successfully than others.
