Wellcome Trust invests in venture capital


The charity Wellcome Trust has decided to invest in venture capital in order to profit from expected initial public offerings by internet companies such as Facebook and Twitter, the Financial Times reports. In the past year, the trust has increased its allocation to venture capital and private equity to 19% of its GBP13.6bn potfolio. The charity has not disclosed its previous level of allocation to private equity, which now represents about 50% of the GBP4bn invested in private equity.
