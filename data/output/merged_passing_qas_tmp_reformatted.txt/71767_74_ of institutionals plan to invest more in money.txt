74% of institutionals plan to invest more in money market funds


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } Nearly three quarters (74%) of institutional investors are planning to make more use of money market funds, in addition to savings accounts, in direct reaction to regulations such as Basel III, which is leading several banks to remove non-operational savings from their balance sheets, a new study from State Street Corporation finds. Partitipants in the survey include institutional and alternative managers who operate in sectors such as hedge funds, real estate and private equity. In total, 82 people responded to the survey, undertaken between 8 and 25 January 2018. 43% of institutional investors are convinced that bank savings interest rates will continue to fall this year, helping to make other cash investment options, such as money market funds, which have higher potential for returns, more attractive. By 2021, 43% of institutionals participating in the survey are also predicting that investors will pay more attention to cash allocations, while only 4% predict that these will decline. In addition to Basel III, new regulations such as European Union money market reforms which will take effect on 21 July 2018 for new funds, and 21 July 2019 for conversion of existing funds (which will affect EUR1trn in assets) will reform standards for liquidity and quality of securities credit, State Street Corporation notes. As a direct consequence of this reform, 45% of participants feel that investors will undertake a complete reexamination of the way in which they use money market funds. More than half of respondents (54%) predict that the new rules will contribute to a change in investment policies for many European institutional investors, to authorise investments in variable liquidity money market funds.
