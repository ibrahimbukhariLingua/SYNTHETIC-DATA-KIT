Spain - Santander postpones sale of asset management unit


According to sources close to the banking group reported by Cinco DÃ­as, Santander has decided to postpone the sale of its affiliate Santander Asset Management, whose assets fell by 36% last year to less than EUR32.95bn. At present, in light of the conservative profile of the portfolio, which as a result does not generate very high revenues from management commissions, Santander would make only EUR800m-EUR1.2bn from a sale of its affiliate, though it had hoped to sell it for EUR3bn.
