Hedge funds are not systemic institutions, says AIMA


The Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA), an association of hedge fund managers, announced at the end of last week in a statement that no hedge funds were qualified to be labelled as financial institutions that are relevant to the financial system. That designation would of course imply increased surveillance by regulatory authorities. In the United States, the Financial Stability Oversight Council will soon announce a decision as to the criteria which will determine the systemic character of non-banking financial establishments.“We estimate that no hedge fund is currently important, leveraged, complex or interconnected enough that its bankruptcy or a situation of financial stress would lead to a disturbance in the market capable of destabilising the financial system,” the AIMA president, Todd Groome, says, adding that the British FSA has recently undertaken a study of hedge funds which found that the levels of leverage used were “relatively low,” suggesting “a limited level of risk.”The professional association comments that in 2008, more than 1,400 hedge funds were closed or liquidated without particular impact on the stability of the financial system as a whole.The AIMA reiterates its support for registration of hedge fund managers with the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) or other national authorities.
