Crux AM to launch a new European strategy in Luxembourg


The British asset management firm Crux Asset Management will in February 2017 launch a new European equity strategy to include British equities within a Luxembourg Sicav, Richard Pease, the iconic manager of the independent boutique, has announced at a press conference in Paris.The launch will make it possible to satisfy the expectations of European investors in two ways. Many of these investors prefer to invest in European portfolios which include the United Kingdomm. The current funds of the Crux AM range are focused on equities of continental Europe, and are also British-registered OEIC funds. The Luxembourg Sicav will thus give the firm a European base, at a time when the United Kingdom has voted in favour of Brexit. A feeder fund for the Crux European Special Situations Fund will also be created.Crux AM, founded in October 2014, had hitherto managed two funds. The larger of these, Crux European Special Situations Fund, is partly the fund which Pease had managed at Henderson Global Investors, which he brought with him at his arrival at the firm in June 2015. The fund currently has assets of EUR1.5bn. The other fund, launched one year ago, has about EUR30m in assets. Both are managed in nearly the same manner, by Pease and James Milne, with a bias for larger caps in the second case.The management approach of the two managers is oriented strongly to businesses, and is close to private equity. This allows it to step back from an “ugly” economic and political environment, according to Pease.
