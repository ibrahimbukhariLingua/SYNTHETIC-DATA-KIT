Hamlin Capital Management launches its first UCITS fund


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The asset management firm Hamlin Capital Management, based in New York, has launched its first UCITS fund domiciled in Ireland, entitled Hamlin High Dividend Equity Ucits Fund. For this, RBC Investor & Treasury Services has been mandated for custody and administration services to the new fund. The launch confirms the interest of US asset management firms in the UCITS format. “US fund managers are increasingly seeking to grow outside their traditional national market, and they are attracted to countries like Ireland and Luxembourg for their status as international centres for distribution of investment funds worldwide, notes Kevin O’Neill, managing director in charge of asset management firms for North America at RBC Investor & Treasury, cited in a statement. US asset management firms already represent 54% of assets under administration and under custody in funds domiciled in Ireland, and 24% for funds domiciled in Luxembourg.”
