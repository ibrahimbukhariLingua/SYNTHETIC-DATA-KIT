UK asset management firms on the offensive


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The British Investment Management Association (IMA) has decided to create a centre to help foreign asset management firms which would like to set up shop in London, rather than Dublin or Luxembourg, Investment Week reports. The professional association is responding to an initiative by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to improve the attractiveness of the United Kingdom to asset management firms. Among the measures taken are the discontinuation of a tax of funds, which is often cited as slowing the inflow of foreign firms to the UK. The director general of the IMA, Daniel Godfrey, has said that a working group would study the priority measures that may be passed within the next few weeks to capture billions of pounds in assets in UCITS funds domiciled in Ireland, but mostly sold to British investors, within the next few weeks.
