Bestinver seeks to reassure investors


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } The departure of Francisco Garcia Paramés, chief investment officer at Bestinver (EUR7.5bn in assets) after 25 years of good and loyal service to the asset management firm, is causing a lot of ink to be spilled in Spain. His replacement by Beltran de la Lastra, who has had an 18-years career at J.P. Morgan, visibly did not reassure the markets. For this reason, Luis Rivera Novo, chairman of Bestinver, has sent a letter to investors to reassure them about the current situation at the firm. In the letter, dated 26 September, a copy of which has been obtained by NewsManagers, the chairman states that the departure of Garcia Paramés “has not interfered with correct operational daily operations” at the firm, noting the experience, quality and excellence of the professionals who make up Bestinver. He also claims that the departure “has not provoked significant redemption demands either.” Moerover, according to the website Cinco Dias, which offers figures compiled by Morningstar, investors have withdrawn about EUR611m from Bestinver, equivalent to a loss of 7% of its assets under management. These figures should be treated with caution, however, since they are not official figures.
