Local approach is key for a sucessful strategy in Asia, according to Cerulli


Adopting a localization approach appears the best bet to gain success and challenge local players, according to Cerulli Associates’ report, Asia Marketing and Sales Organizations 2014.“Foreign asset managers that attempt to formulate a pan-Asian marketing and sales strategy need to address diverse regulations, differing investor maturity levels, and largely bank-dominated distribution networks inherent in the current landscape”, writes the consultant.Unlike local managers who have strong brand recognition either due to a long history in these markets or because they are part of a bigger financial holdings group, foreign managers have their work cut out to generate a level of brand awareness strong enough to challenge local players.Cerulli also found that more than 60% of Asian managers intend to increase leverage of the internet and social media platforms for advertising purposes. This is especially apparent in more locally focused markets such as China, India, and Korea."Asians generally seek financial information from their colleagues, friends, or relatives. As such, word of mouth will have a great impact on people’s perception of a fund manager. A re-post of an article from a fund manager by an investor in their WeChat or KakaoTalk accounts is a personal endorsement to hundreds of their friends,» says Rachel Poh, an analyst with Cerulli who co-led the report.Deepening relationships with major distributors in each market is also a key element in managers’ marketing and sales strategies."Providing consistent and continuous support, timely data, and proactive communication with easy access to portfolio managers are essentials that managers have to fulfil, and these can be best achieved with sufficient on-the-ground resources,» says Yoon Ng, Asia research director with Cerulli."Beyond increasing engagement with local partners and distributors, understanding the taboos within each market can help managers to structure marketing efforts and make it easier for distributors to sell their products, as well as forge closer relationships with them,» she adds.
