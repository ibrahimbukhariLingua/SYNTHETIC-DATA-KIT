IPOs: Postponements and cancellations rife in second quarter


Initial public offerings with a total value considerably higher than EUR8bn were postponed or cancelled on stock markets worldwide in first quarter, according to the “IPO Watch Europe” study from PwC. During this period, many businesses seeking a stock market debut ultimately abstained due to increasingly serious concerns about global economic growth, particularly in China, but also due to the ongoing debt crisis in the euro zone. Volatility indices have reached their highest levels since November 2011. After an encouraging first quarter, activities slowed considerably in second quarter. The 80 operations completed raised only EUR0.7bn, while the number of launched and funds raised fell by 40% and 95%, respectively, year on year. In second quarter 2011, 134 operations generated EUR13.4bn (of which EUR6.9bn were due to the Glencore IPO). This slowdown is the result not only of difficult conjuncture, but also of the fact that many businesses have postponed their stock market debys for 6 to 12 months due to deteriorating market conditions in the second half of 2011. The European market was the most severely affected of the major markets, and risks remaining at a flatline for a good part of second half, until investor confidence in the markets returns. Only three IPOS were completed in Paris in the quarter, raising EUR42.8m, a 31% increase in value compared with second quarter 2011 with an equivalent volume, when 3 IPOS raised EUR29.7m.
