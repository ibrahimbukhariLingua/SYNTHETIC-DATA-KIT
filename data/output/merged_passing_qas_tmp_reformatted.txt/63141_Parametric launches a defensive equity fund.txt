Parametric launches a defensive equity fund


Parametric Portfolio Associates LLC (Parametric), an affiliate of Eaton Vance Corp., has announced the launch of Parametric Volatility Risk Premium ‒ Defensive Fund. The fund is co-managed by three Parametric investment principals: Thomas C. Seto, head of investment management, Thomas B. Lee, CFA, managing director of investment strategy and research, and Jay Strohmaier, managing director and senior portfolio manager. Eaton Vance Management is the fund’s investment adviser and Parametric serves as the fund’s sub-adviser.The fund’s investment objective is total return. It invests in a base portfolio generally comprising an approximately equal mix of U.S. equity securities and cash and cash equivalents. The fund sells call options on the S&P 500 Index (or a substitute) on substantially the full value of the Fund’s equity securities, and put options on the S&P 500 Index (or a substitute) on substantially the full value of the cash position. By applying a systematic, rules-based options strategy, the fund seeks to take advantage of the tendency for volatility priced into options to be higher, on average, than the volatility actually experienced on the securities underlying the option. Actual, or realized, volatility may be higher or lower than anticipated. The fund also intends to engage in a systematic program of tax-loss harvesting within its equity portfolio.
