Tradeweb launches a trading platform dedicated to European ETFs


Tradeweb Markets on 23 October announced the launch of an electronic trading platform dedicated to ETFs listed in Europe via its MTF operator, Tradeweb Europe Limited. This is an unprecedented initiative in Europe, which may give a new impetus to the ETF segment, which has already seen growth of nearly 40% per year over the past ten years, and whose assets under management as of third quarter totalled USD309bn, according to the research agency ETFGI. A significant proportion of these assets are traded over the counter due to the fragmentation of this market. Tradeweb is launching a dedicated platform in order to provide privileged access to a consolidated liquidity pool for all ETFs listed in Europe. Eleven dealers are already offering liquidity to the market. The new framework will also allow better price formation for over-the-counter transactions. Adriano Pace, head of equity derivatives at Tradeweb, says the platform offers an integrated trading process and several functions which reduce the risk of errors and improve the efficiency of the market substantially.
