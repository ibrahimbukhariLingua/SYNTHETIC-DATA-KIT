US private equity moves in on repossessed homes


Oliver Chang, who until recently had been a real estate specialist on behalf of the Morgan Stabley bank, has announced that he is creating an investment fund to buy up to USD1bn in repossessed homes in the next two years, Les Echos reports. He has already raised USD300m from a private equity investor, whose identity has not been revealed. Changâ€™s new firm, known as Silvan Road Capital LLC, will focus on the South-Eastern and Midwestern United States, in markets where it will be able to acquire hundreds of houses at a time, in order to realise economies of scale. Chang is promising his investors returns of about 9% per year.
