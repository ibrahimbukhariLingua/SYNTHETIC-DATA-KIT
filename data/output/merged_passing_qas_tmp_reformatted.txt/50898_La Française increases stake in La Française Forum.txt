The platform will be renamed as La Française Real Estate Partners International (La Française REP International), and “will benefit from reinforced services from La Française in terms of commercial development and customer relationship support,” a statement says. Following the reorganization, the existing London-based team will join the offices of La Française at 78 Brook Street in Mayfair. The platform provides compete investment management services, both for direct and indirect real estate investments, to clients in Europe, the United Kingdom and Asia. It has offices in London and Frankfurt, and has recently opened an office in Seoul. The firm had EUR996m in assets under management as of 31 July 2016.
