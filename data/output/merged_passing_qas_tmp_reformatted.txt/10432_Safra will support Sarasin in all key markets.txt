Safra will support Sarasin in all key markets


The CEO of Sarasin, Joachim Strähle, has said in an interview with Finanz und Wirtschaft, published on 3 December, that the new majority shareholder in Sarasin, Safra, will support the Swiss bank in all of its key markets. Unlike its former majority shareholder, Rabobank, Safra is prepared to invest, and the group has USD12.2bn. The new majority shareholder will also support Sarasin’s expansion strategy. “Safra wants us to develop further in the Middle East and in Asia, and to accept slightly lower profitability in exchange,” the CEO says.
