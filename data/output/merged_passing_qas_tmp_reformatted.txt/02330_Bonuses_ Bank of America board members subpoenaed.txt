Bonuses: Bank of America board members subpoenaed


The day after a federal judge rejected an out-of-court settlement between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Bank of America over USD5.8bn in bonuses the latter paid to its employees on the day before its acquisition of Merrill Lynch on 23 December, the attorney general of the state of New York, Andrew Cuomo, yesterday subpoenaed five board members at the American bank, Les Echos reports. Like judge Jed Rakoff, who on Monday rejected the compromise with the SEC, the attorney general accuses the directors of the bank, which received USD45bn in federal assistance, including USD20bn to aid in its absorption of Merrill Lynch, of knowingly concealing the bonus payments until after the closing of the merger deal on 1 January.
