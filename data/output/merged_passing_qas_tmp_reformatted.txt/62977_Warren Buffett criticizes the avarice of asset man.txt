Warren Buffett criticizes the avarice of asset managers


In his letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett stepped up his attacks against Wall Street fund managers on Saturday, estimating that US investors have wasted more than $ 100 billion over the past decade on expensive advice. The billionaire devoted much of his 27-page letter, read widely in the world, to arguments against stock pickers that charge high management fees and fail to beat the market. He also assured that he had won a $ 1 million bet with another asset manager that index funds would outperform hedge funds within a decade. It has taken a fund replicating the S & P 500 index, which has performed better than several hedge funds over the period 2007-2017, as the index fund has gained 85.4% since 2007, compared with 2.9% to 62.8% for Other funds. «A hedge fund operator’s ability to simply pile up assets under management has made many of these managers extraordinarily rich, even as their investments have performed poorly» he says."If 1,000 managers make a market prediction at the beginning of a year, it’s very likely that the calls of at least one will be correct for nine consecutive years. Of course, 1,000 monkeys would be just as likely to produce a seemingly all-wise prophet. But there would remain a difference: The lucky monkey would not find people standing in line to invest with him», said the letter."The bottom line: When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients. Both large and small investors should stick with low-cost index funds», conclude the billionaire
