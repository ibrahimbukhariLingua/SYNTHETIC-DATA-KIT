Raiffeisenbank Reutte acquires Bauer private bank


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Since 1 October, the Austrian firm Raiffeisenbank Reutte, which already controls the Austrian private bank Bankhaus Jungholz, controls 85% of the German private bank Bankhaus Bauer, based in Stuttgart, while the remaining 15% for the moment remains in the hands of the DÃ¼sseldorfer Hypothekenbank. The acquisition price has not been disclosed. The Jungholz bank is based in a village with 300 residents in Bavaria, but which legally belongs to Austria. As Johannes Gomig, chairman of the managing board at Raifeissenbank Reutte explains, the acquisition of Bauer will allow the Austrian group to serve high net worth German clients who do not want to open an account abroad, but who are interested in banking with an Austrian institution.
