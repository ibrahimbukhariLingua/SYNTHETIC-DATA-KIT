Official report calls on Norwegian fund to increase equity exposure


The Norwegian sovereign fund, Government Pension Fund Global (EUR798bn in assets under management) is expected to increase its exposure to equities and take more risks, according to the findings of a report ordered by the government, published on Tuesday. The majority of members of the committee responsible for creating the study recommend that the sovereign fund place 70% of its assets in equities, compared with 60% presently. “A higher share of equities increases the expected return, and the contribution to the fiscal budget, but also entails more volatility in the value of the Fund and a higher risk of a decline in its long-run value. The majority is of the view that the this risk is acceptable, provided that there is political will and ability to adapt economic policy to the accompanying increase in risk, in both the short and long run,” the report says.A minority of members of the committee, including its chairman, Knut Anton Mork, recommend that the proportion of equities be reduced to 50%. This suggests that the question will be debated before being ruled upon by the government next Spring.
