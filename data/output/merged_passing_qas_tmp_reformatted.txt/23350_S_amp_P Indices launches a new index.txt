S&amp;P Indices launches a new index


The index provider S&P Indices on 19 March announced the launch of the S&P GIVI (S&P Global Intrinsic Value Index), which associates reduced volatility with a specific weighting which takes into account the intrinsic value of a share rather than its market capitalisation. S&P has issued a license to use the index and the complete family of sub-indices for developed and emerging markets to Goldman Sachs Asset Management.
