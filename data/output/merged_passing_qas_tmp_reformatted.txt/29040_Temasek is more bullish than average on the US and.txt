The executive, who claims to be more bullish than average about the two regions, sees potential in the areas of energy, healthcare, and tech. In addition, Temasek “has the luxury of being a long-term investor, doesn’t have to worry about redemptions, which allows it to make investments in the country it wants when it wants.”
