Julius Baer makes major recruitments for private banking in Germany


Following the example of Vontobel, which more than one year ago decided to make Germany its second domestic market, Swiss-based Julius Baer on 10 January announced that it has made a very significant addition to its private banking personnel in Germany, with the recruitment of Heiko Schlag (formerly of HypoVereinsbank) as head of private banking at Bank Julius Bär Europe (headquartered in Frankfurt), and of 14 client relationship managers, for locations in Frankfurt, Hamburg and Stuttgart. New offices will be opened in Kiel and Würzburg.Schlag, Christian E. Dubler and Gerhard Grebe are board members at Bank Julius Baer Europe AG. With Alexander Jecht, they form the extended executive board.
