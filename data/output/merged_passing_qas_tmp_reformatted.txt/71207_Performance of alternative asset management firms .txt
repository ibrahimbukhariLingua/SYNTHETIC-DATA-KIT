Performance of alternative asset management firms is key for private banks


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } A vast majority of private banks in Europe (84%) think that performance is the most important factor when they undertake due diligence on third-party alternative asset management firms, a new study by Cerulli Associates finds. Risk controlling and fees take second and third place as important factors in the selection of managers. Meanwhile, 72% of private banks surveyed by Cerulli indicate that performance is one of the most important factors when they decide to remove managers from their list. However, some pension funds can tolerate underperformance for a few years.
