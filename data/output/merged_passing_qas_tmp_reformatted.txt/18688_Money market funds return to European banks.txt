Money market funds return to European banks


US money market funds have raised their exposure to European banks, the Financial Times reports, citing figures from Fitch Ratings. Exposure by he major money market funds to European financial sector businesses at the end of September rose 16% in US dollars. This increase follows declarations by Mario Draghi, chairman of the ECB, in July, that he would do “everything necessary” to preserve the euro. Despite the rebound in confidence in European banks, US money market funds are still avoiding banks on the European periphery. Exposure remains low overall, as funds are allocating only 11% of their portfolios to banks located in Europe.
