Invesco PowerShares launches the first ETF to target equity buybacks in Europe


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Invesco PowerShares, the fourth-largest ETF provider in the world, on 3 November announced the launch in Europe of the PowerShares Global Buyback Achievers UCITS fund, listed on the London Stock Exchange since the end of October. The new ETF invests in companies which have repurchased at least 5% of their equities in the past 12 months, the asset management firm says in a statement, where it claims that the fund is the “first Buyback ETF available in Europe.” The vehicle replicates the Nasdaq Global Buyback Achievers Net Total Return index via complete physical replication. The benchmark index is composed of businesses from two other indices, the Nasdaq US Buyback Achievers and Nasdaq International Buyback Achievers, which includes companies which have carried out an overall reduction in their capital of at least 5% in the past 12 months, in the case of the first index, and in the past tax year in the case of the second index. The new PowerShares Global Buyback Achievers UCITS ETF will be listed on Euronext Paris on 12 November, and on Borsa Italiana and Deutsche Börse Xetra on 24 November. The tracker fund will be listed on SIX Swiss Exchange in December, pending approval by the regulator.
