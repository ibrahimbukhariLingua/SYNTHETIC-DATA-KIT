Bill Ackman and Perry Capital fund attack JCPenney


Bill Ackman of the fund Pershing Square Capital Management has called for Thomas Engibous, chairman of the board at the retail chain JCPenney, to be replaced as soon as possible, Les Echos reports. Ackman already has a replacement in mind: Allen Questrom, former CEO of JCPenney, who would be willing to return to the role. The current chairman and CEO, Myron Ullman, is not to the liking of Ackman either, who would like to see him go. The speculative fund Perry Capital, which controls 7.3% of capital, on Friday announced that it plans to support Ackman, the largest shareholder in the business. The management at JCPenney has called Ackman’s agitation “misleading, inaccurate and counterproductive,” at a time when the survival of the business is at stake.
