Appetite for risk at highest levels since April 2006


In October, investorsâ€™ appetite for risk is at its highest levels in more than three years, while fears of a W-shaped recession have dissipated, according to the most recent BofA Merrill Lynch Survey of Fund Managers (October). A majority of respondents estimated that a global recession in the next twelve months was unlikely, compared with 47% one month earlier. A net 72% of respondents estimate that corporate profits will improve in the next twelve months, compared with 68% in September. The corollary of this optimism is that exposures to cash are at their lowest levels since January 2004, and respondents are now overweight in equities (a net 38%) compared with 27% in September. Optimism for Europe is also notable. 30% of managers estimate that Euro zone equities are undervalued compared with other regions, the highest level of respondents to think so since April 2001. 9% of respondents want to go overweight in the region in the next twelve months, compared with 7% one month earlier. Japan, however, is seen as the least attractive region for the next twelve months, while outlooks for China remain excellent.
