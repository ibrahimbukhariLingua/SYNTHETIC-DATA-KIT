NGAM tops EUR2bn in assets in Germany


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In an interview with the Börsen-Zeitung, Jörg Knaf, CEO for Nothern Europe at Natixis Global Asset Management (NGAM), admits that the entanglement of the various asset management firms in the group can be a little hard to follow, not only for retail investors, but also for future distribution partners.Each affiliate uses its own investment strategy, largely independently of that of the group. NGAM is now successful with institutional investors, particularly pension funds, with the Loomis Sayles equity and bond small cap corporate bond funds and the Ossiam ETFs.Since its arrival on the German market in 2008, NGAM has passed EUR2bn in assets, not counting real estate assets.
