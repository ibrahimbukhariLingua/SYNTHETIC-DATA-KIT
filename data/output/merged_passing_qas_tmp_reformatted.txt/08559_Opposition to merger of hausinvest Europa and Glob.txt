Opposition to merger of hausinvest Europa and Global funds


The investor defence association Aktionsbund Aktiver Anlegerschutz (AAA) is planning a lawsuit against Commerz Real over its plans to merge the open-ended real estate fund hausinvest Europa (EUR10.89bn in assets) with the hausinvest Global fund (EUR1.58bn) on 30 September, Das Investment reports. The AAA claims that the deal could disadvantage subscribers in the hausinvest Europa fund as half of the portfolio of the hausinvest Global fund is composed of properties located in Singapore, Canada and Japan, many of which are under leases which will expire this year or in 2011. Fees for the hausinvest Global are also higher, and would be charged to shareholders in the hausinvest Europa if the funds were merged.
