BrickVest launches first actively managed fund


BrickVest, an online real estate investment platform, on Thursday11 April launched its active fund strategy with a first fund, entitled Harvest Active 1. The fund is currently on sale to members of BrickVest Access, the AIFM fund distribution and liquidity platform from BrickVest, supported by a community of 6,000 investors. “The objective for this fund range will be to facilitate transactions on the secondary market, which is traditionally not highly liquid, by offering unique advantages to buyers and sellers,” the private equity specialist explains. Harvest Active 1 is about to acquire a minority stake in a portfolio of real estate properties located in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The portfolio consists of three office properties and one shopping centre, which already generate tens of millions [of euros] in net annual revenues. The occupancy rate for the existing properties stands at 96%. The operation is undertaken in partnership with HB Reavis, a specialist in the promotion of real estate, which has a strong presence in central and eastern Europe, Germany, and the United Kingdom. “After this initial placement, the fund will have a sourcing, negotiation and trading mandate for equities in the underlying property on the secondary market. This strategy will aim to generate optimal returns through the acquisition of equities over the liquid valuation, while providing liquidity to shareholders,” BrickVest states.
