Changes on the way in banking surveillance


The directors of the Bundesbank this weekend voted to set up an integrated structure to which all banking supervisory functions which it currently shares with BaFin, the German market regulator, will be transferred. The head of the Bundesbank, Axel Weber, says that a complete absorption of BaFin could put an end to the two-headed structure created a decade ago, which is currently viewed as ineffective.
