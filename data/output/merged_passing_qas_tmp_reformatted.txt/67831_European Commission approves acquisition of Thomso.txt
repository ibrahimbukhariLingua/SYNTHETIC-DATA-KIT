European Commission approves acquisition of Thomson Reuters F&amp;R by Blackstone


The European Commission has approved the acquisition of Thomson Reuters Financial and Risk Business (“Thomson Reuters F&R”) by the Blackstone group in the United States. Thomson Reuters F&R is a data and financial technologies business, an affiliate of the Thomson Reuters group, which provides information and data analysis, allows financial transactions, and connects professional trading, investment and risk communities. The operation, valued at USD20bn for 55% of F&R, was announced in January this year. The European Commission notes that Blackstone, via its portfolio company Ipreo, and Thomson Reuters F&R both provide financial information products to professionals in financial markets, including real-time and non-real-time data services. The operation will result in a number of horizontal and vertical overlaps between the activities of the companies. But following its investigation, the Commission concluded that the planned operation would not create any competition problems, in light of the limited market share for the two companies, the continued presence of a number of competitors on the financial information market following the transaction, and the fact that Blackstone represents only a minimal part of demand for F&R products from Thomson Reuters. p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; }
