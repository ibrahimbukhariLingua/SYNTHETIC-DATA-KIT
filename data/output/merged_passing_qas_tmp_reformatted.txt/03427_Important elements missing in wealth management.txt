Important elements missing in wealth management


According to statistics dating from 2007, the Chinese wealth management market had doubled since 2000, to a total of USD350bn. At the end of 2007, there were about 415,000 high net worth investors (HNWI) with financial assets of over USD1m, and 6,038 ultra-high net worth investors (UHNWI) with more than USD30m, according to a Celent study (http://www.celent.com/124_1600.htm). Hua Zhang, an analyst at the Asia Research Group at Celent, says the major challenges for the wealth management industry lies in the fact that products are undifferentiated, and a prevailing ignorance about global asset allocation. In addition to this there is a lack of protection of clientsâ€™ personal information and genuine risks in need of management. Lastly, the sector is suffering from a lack of high quality professionals.
