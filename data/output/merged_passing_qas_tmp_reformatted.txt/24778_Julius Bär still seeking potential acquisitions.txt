Julius Bär still seeking potential acquisitions


The bank Julius Bär no longer sees great acquisition opportunities in Switzerland, after a proposed merger with Sarasin fell through, the CEO of the bank, Boris Collardi, says in an interview with Funanz und Wirtschaft magazine reports. He also stated that he was not interested in acquiring independent wealth management firms, as he sees consolidation as “inevitable” in this area. However, Julius Bär may acquire the Swiss affiliates of international banks which are currently under pressure, the CEO says, adding that potential acquisitions are not limited to Switzerland. Participations in banks and financial service providers in emerging markets are also possibilities.
