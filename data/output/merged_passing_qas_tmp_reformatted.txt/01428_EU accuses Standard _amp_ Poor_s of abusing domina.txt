EU accuses Standard &amp; Poor’s of abusing dominant position


La Tribune reports that Standard & Poor’s was notified on Monday that a complaint has been filed against it by the European Union for abuse of its dominant position. The EU accuses the agency of taking advantage of its monopoly in the United States on the assignment of ISIN codes to require banks and providers of information services in Europe to pay usage fees. Standard & Poor’s yesterday stated that it “disagrees” with this initial evaluation; it now has eight weeks to respond. The firm faces a fine of up to 10% of its annual revenues, the newspaper notes.
