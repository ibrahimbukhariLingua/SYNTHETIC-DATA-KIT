SEB ImmoPortfolio Target Return gets keys to Cacilium


Approximately 14 months after the contract was signed, the ImmoPortfolio Target Return fund from the British management firm SEB Asset Management has received keys to the Cäcilium building in Cologne, which it purchased for EUR75.5m from the developer Kölbl Kruse of Essen. The 6-story property, with 17,500 square metres in floor area and 141 underground parking spaces, has received the DNGB environmental label. The property is already 89% leased, and the vendor will provide a guarantee on the remaining vacant space in the property for a two-year period. The Cäcilium building is the 11th German property in the portfolio of the ImmoPortfolio Target Return, an open-ended fund reserved for high net worth private and institutional investors. Assets total EUR734.3m, and the portfolio is composed of 37 properties in 12 countries.
