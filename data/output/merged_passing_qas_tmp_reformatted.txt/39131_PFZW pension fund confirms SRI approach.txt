PFZW pension fund confirms SRI approach


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Netherlands pension fund for healthcare professionals PFZW, whose assets under management total about EUR140bn, would like to continue to apply its SRI strategy despite the upset provoked by its decision to pull out of the capital of five Israeli banks, IPE reports. The decision to divest take by PFZW led to demonstrations in front of the offices of PGGM, the asset management firm of PFZW, as well as outgrated reactions from several Jewish organisations. PFZW does not plan to modify its approach, but admits that in the case of the Israeli banks, its communication could have been better in order to prevent its initiative being interpreted as a boycott of Israel.
