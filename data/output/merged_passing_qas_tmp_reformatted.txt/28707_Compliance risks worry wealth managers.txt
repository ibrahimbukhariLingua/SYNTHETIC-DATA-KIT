Compliance risks worry wealth managers


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Private banking and wealth management professionals are under increasingly significant regulatory pressure, which is influencing their profit margins, according to the findings of a report by the auditing and consulting firm PwC, “Navigating to Tomorrow: serving clients and creating value,” a survey taking in 200 institutions in over 50 countries. The pressure is triggered by “increasingly strict and onerous” regulatory requirement, as well as “an unequal rate of growth in various geographical regions, the loss of certain commissions, and a reduced level of activity,” PwC says. In terms of risk management, respondents say that in two years, quantifying risks (+28%) and concentrating on the final value delivered to participants (+25%) will be the two criteria whose importance will increase most. The cost of applying regulations will continue to increase. Respondents predict that the cost of compliance with regulations will represent 7% of their annual earnings in the next two years, compared with 5% currently.
