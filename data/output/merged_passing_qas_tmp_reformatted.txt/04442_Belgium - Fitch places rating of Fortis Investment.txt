Belgium - Fitch places rating of Fortis Investments on ?rating watch evolving?


On Thursday, Fitch Ratings announced that it has placed its asset manager rating of M2 for Fortis Investment Management (FIM) under a ?rating watch evolving,? for all asset management activities excluding alternative investment and structured credit. The ratings watch is due to a lack of details about the ongoing merger process between Banque Fortis and BNP Paribas; in particular, there is a lack of clarity about the possible integration of FIM and BNPP Investment Partners (which is rated M2+).
