FSMA fines Ageas EUR500,000


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Belgian financial market authority, the FSMA, has imposed a fine of EUR500,000 on Ageas, the insurer descended from the former Fortis, for late or incorrect information in the lead-up to the collapse of Fortis in 2008, Reuters reports. Two former Fortis heads at the time, in May and June 2008, have also been fined, though the amounts were not disclosed. The FSMA finds that Fortis was too late to release, and released incorrect information regarding conditions imposed by the European Commission after the acquisition of the Netherlands activities of ABN Amro. Ageas on Wednesday announced that it intends to appeal.
