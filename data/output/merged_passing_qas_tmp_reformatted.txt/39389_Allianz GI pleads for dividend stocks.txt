Allianz GI pleads for dividend stocks


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In many countries, dividends offer a higher return than 10-year government bonds. In this area, European businesses in particular are more generous than their US counterparts, and for more than 2 years, investors exposed to European equities have been benefiting from dividends returns well higher than those from bond investments. A study recently publshed by Allianz Global Investors finds that in the past 40 eyars, dividends accounted for 40% of total returns from European equities. At a time when profits have risen sharply after the 2008-2009 crisis, the distribution rate for businesses has fallen considerably, In Europe the dividend/profit ratio per share now stands at about 55%, which is a lower level than historically. Denis Nacken, author of the study, says this is a sign that “there is room for dividends to rise.” The study also finds that didends payments have been very closely watched by market actors. Every downward revision of dividends also becomes a subject of concern. As shown by conclusive data for the United States since 1900, dividend payments have been less volatile than corproate profits in real terms.
