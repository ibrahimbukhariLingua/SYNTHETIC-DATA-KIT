Caceis and Santander Securities Services to merge


Crédit Agricole and Santander on 17 April announced that they have signed an agreement in principle to merge their institutional services into a new entity, which will be 69.5% controlled by the French banking group, and 30.5% controlled by the Spanish group. The entity will include Caceis, an affiliate of Crédit Agricole SA, and the Spanish and Latin American activities of Santander Securities Services (S3), an affiliate of Santander, and will retain the name Caceis, a statement says. The merger, which will be finalised by the end of 2019, will create a group with €3.343trn in assets under custody, and €1.833trn in assets under administration. “S3 will bring 100% of its Spanish activities, and 49.99% of its Latin American activities into Caceis,” a statement says, adding that the new Caceis will be “better placed to profit from growth in high-potential countries (Latin America and Asia).” Jean-François Abadie, currently CEO of Caceis, will retain his position at the new entity, while Carlos Rodriguez de Robles, the current CEO of S3, will head up activities in Spain and Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Colombia), the two businesses say. The final agreement will be subject to prior approval by personnel representative bodies. Crédit Agricole and Santander are expecting to finalise the operation “by the end of 2019.” Caceis was created in 2005 in the merger of the custody activities of Crédit Agricole and the Caisses d’Epargne.
