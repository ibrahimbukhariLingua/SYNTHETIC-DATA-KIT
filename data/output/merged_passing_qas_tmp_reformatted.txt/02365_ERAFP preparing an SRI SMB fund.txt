ERAFP preparing an SRI SMB fund


In partnership with EDHEC, the French civil servants pension fund ERAFP (Etablissement de retraite additionnelle de la Fonction publique) is working on an SRI index of SMBs, based on risk budget rather than capitalisation, Responsible Investor reports. Once the index has been created, ERAFP will launch a RFP to manage a fund worth a few tens of millions of Euros, which would use the index as a benchmark, says CEO Philippe Desfoss√©s, who adds that ERAFP is likely to open the index to other asset management firms.
