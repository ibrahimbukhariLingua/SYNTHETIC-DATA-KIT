Hedge funds do not want to limit bonuses


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Specialists in the hedge fund sector have called on the British government to protect the interests of the City, by moving to protect hedge funds from proposals coming from the European Union which would require the funds to limit bonuses, as the rules could drive hedge funds to move to more friendly regulatory environments, City A.M. reports. According to the proposal, which has not yet been adopted, but which is widely supported, variable pay would not be allowed to exceed fixed pay. Bonsues would, however, be allowed to reach as much as twice fixed remuneration on the condition that a qualified majority of shareholders approve it. “This proposal presents an enormous problem for hedge funds, and we are all asking about how we can build a remuneration structure which would let us encourage hedge funds without exiling them to Hong Kong or New York,” says Joe Seet, of the consulting firm Sigma Partnership. The British Investment Management Association (IMA), for its part, has announced that it will do everything it can to prevent the regulations being imposed on the hedge fund sector, which it claims is already well aligned with the interests of its clients.
