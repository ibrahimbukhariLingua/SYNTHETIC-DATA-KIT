Banking secrecy is officially abolished


The era of numbered bank accounts is officially at an end. The contributions tax administration (AFC) on 5 October announced that Switzerland will now be automatically sharing information concerning clients with the tax authorities in dozens of countries. The AFC has announced that for the first time, it exchanged data in late September, “as part of global standards for automatic information exchange (EAR),” according to a statement. The first EAR data exchange is specified for Switzerland to exchange with the member states of the European Union in 208, and with nine other countries and territories (Australia, Canada, South Korea, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Iceland, Japan, Jersey and Norway).Cyprus and Romania are not included for the moment, since they do not yet fulfil international requirements in the area of data confidentiality and security. The AFC also comments that “transfer of data to Australia and France will be delayed, since these States cannot yet deliver data to the AFC for technical reasons.” The AFC has also not yet received data from Croatia, Estonia, or Poland. The other partner states have sent data to the AFC.So far, about 7,000 financial institutions submitting declarations (banks, trusts, insurers, etc.) have registered with the AFC. These entities have collected and submitted the data. The AFC has sent information on about 2 million financial accounts to member States, and has received information about millions of accounts from them. Final figures concerning the data received are not yet available. The AFC cannot reveal any information about the volume of financial assets.
