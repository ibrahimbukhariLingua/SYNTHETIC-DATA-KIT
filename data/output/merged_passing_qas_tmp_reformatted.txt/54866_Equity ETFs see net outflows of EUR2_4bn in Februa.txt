European ETFs dedicated to equitie finished February with net outflows of EUR2.4bn, at a time when they had taken in over EUR1bn in the previous month, according to the most recent monthly statistics from Lyxor Asset Management. In all categories combined, the month brought net outflows of EUR271m. In the first two months of the year, assets were down 5% compared with their levels at the end of 2015, at EUR428.5m.All equity ETFs dedicated to developed markets have been affected by outflows. For the first time since April 2015, ETFs in the European region posted capital outflows for the month, totalling EUR1.1bn. Inflows to ETFs specialised in Asian and US equities were also in negative territory, with -EUR821m and -EUR442m respectively. Emerging market equities, however, saw very limited capital outflows (-EUR124m), while emerging market ETFs overall posted positive inflows of EUR196m. This appears to indicate that investors are making a prudent return to this segment at a time when oil prices may have flattened out. It is interesting to note that smart beta ETFs posted significant capital inflows EUR907m), largely to defensive strategies.For bonds, the past month was much more favourable. Capital inflows to bond ETFs recovered, to EUR1.9bn. It is to be noted that bond inflows went largely to government bonds from developed markets. European government bonds saw significant capital inflows (EUR871m), as a further round of quantitative easing is expected to be announced at the next meeting of the ECB in March. Investors seeking safe investments, in a highly volatile environment, also preferred US and German bonds, which took in EUR317m ande EUR332m in capital, respectively. With a total of EUR380m, inflows to ETFs dedicated to corporate and high yield bonds rebounded slightly, mainly on US indices.
