Santander Real Estate postpones sale of Banif Inmobiliario assets


In a notification to the CNMV on Friday, Santander Real Estate has announced that the liquidation of most of the assets of the real estate fund Banif Inmobiliario (EUR2.69bn), from which redemptions have been frozen since 4 March 2009, will come not in second quarter 2010 as initially planned, but in 2011 and the years following. The delay is due to the poor liquidity situation and depressed prices on the real estate market, which has led potential buyers of properties owned by the fund to offer prices which are viewed as unreasonably low by the management firm and its external advisers (CB Richard Ellis and Clifford Chance).
