Santander reaches out-of-court settlement with Madoff receiver


Santander has reached an agreement with Irving H. Picard, the court-appointed receiver to liquidate the assets of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, totalling USD235m, or EUR169m, to settle all legal proceedings filed in the United States against the Spanish bank, Cinco DÃ­as reports. The agreement will now be sent to the bankruptcy court for approval. Picard has admitted that the conduct of Santander in the Madoff affair was not fraudulent, and that there are not grounds to sue the bank or its Optimal funds for damages.
