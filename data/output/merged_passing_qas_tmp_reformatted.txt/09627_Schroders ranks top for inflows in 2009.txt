Schroders ranks top for inflows in 2009


For the British group Schroders, 2009 was probably one of the best years ever in terms of both profits and inflows. And Europe contributed largely to this performance, according to the earliest available data ahead of the publication of results for the group in mid-February. According to data to the end of November released by Lipper Feri, net inflows (excluding money market funds) at Schroders in Europe totalled nearly EUR16bn, putting the British group at the top of the rankings, ahead of Carmignac Gestion (EUR14.66bn) and Deutsche Bank (EUR13.15bn). “Europe drove growth at the group in 2009,” said Nuno Teixera, deputy CEO of Schroders in France, at an investors’ meeting yesterday, adding that bonds attracted EUR5bn in investments, while high yield attracted about EUR2bn. In France, assets increased from about EUR1.8bn at the end of 2008 to about EUR3bn one year later, with net subscriptions of about EUR850m, largely to corporate bonds.
