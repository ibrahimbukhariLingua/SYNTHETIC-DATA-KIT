Equity allocations at their lowest levels in four years, according to BofA Merrill Lynch


Investors are remaining highly prudent, and are continuing to maintain very high cash allocations. Liquidity represented 5.5% of assets in September, compared with 5.4% one month earlier, according to the most recent Fund Manager Survey from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, conducted between 2 and 8 September, and covering a sample of 208 respondents with a total of USD579bn in assets under management. There are at least two reasons for maintaining such a large stash of cash, with pessimism about the evolution of markets a reason for 42% of respondents to the survey, and preference for cash compared with other low-performance alternatives (20%). The September survey finds that 54% of investors, a record percentage, estimate that equities and bonds are overvalued. Equity allocations are currently at their lowest level in four years compared with cash allocations, BofA Merrill Lynch notes.
