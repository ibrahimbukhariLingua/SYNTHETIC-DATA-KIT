Fitch downgrades its AAA rating for France


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } On 12 July, Fitch Ratings lowered its long-term rating of French government debt denominated in foreign exchange as well as in local currency to AA+ from AAA, while maintaining a stable outlook. The country had already lost its AAA rating from S&P and Moodyâ€™s last year.Among the motives for the downgrade, the ratings agency cites the fact that the debt/GDP ratio for France is now expected to reach a peak of 96% in 2014, up from 94% projected in December. Fitch also predicts that the ratio will fall only to 92% by 2017, rather than the 90% previously predicted.The fiscal projection range is primarily negative, due to uncertain growth outlooks and the persistent crisis in the euro zone, even supposing that there is no hesistation in the implementation of budgetary austerity.Meanwhile, economic activity and projections are substantially lower than when Fitch revised its outlook to negative in December 2011.
