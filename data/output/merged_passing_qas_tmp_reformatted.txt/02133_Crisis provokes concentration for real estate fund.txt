Crisis provokes concentration for real estate funds


The Wall Street Journal notes a growing trend for limited partners in private equity funds to require general partners to transfer real estate funds or assets to other fund managers whom they trust. For example, Palmer Capital Partners took over two European real estate funds in July from Belgravia Asset Management, a firm which has since closed down. ING Groep has taken over about USD2.1bn in assets since the beginning of the year from clients seeking to change managers, and in June, ING Clarion took over the New City Asia Opportunity Fund, which was previously managed by New City Asia Fund Management Pte. Ltd of Singapore. AEW (an affiliate of Natixis Global Asset Management) has received transfers of about USD1.5bn in assets from institutional investors, including CalPERS, as these investors have withdrawn their assets from other managers (Shattuck Hammond, in the case of CalPERS).
