UBI and Fédéris Gestion launch SRI convertible bond fund


Union Bancaire Gestion Institutionelle, a French firm of the Swiss Union Bancaire Privée group, and Fédéris Gestion d’Actifs, are launching a socially responsible European convertible bond fund, entitled Convertibles Europe Responsable. The product is managed by the convertible bond team at UBI, which consists of five specialists and two managers. Fédéris Gestion d’Actifs contributes its expertise in SRI analysis, to select from a universe of 1,700 securities. “The selection of convertible bonds responds to environmental, social and governance (ESG) management, with the objective of achieving a portfolio with a higher SRI rating than its benchmark index, the UBS Global Convertibles Indices Europe Hedged (EUR),” a statement says. The fund invests at least two thirds of its assets in convertible and assimilated bonds. The sensitivity range of the fund to interest rates is from 0 to 6. Maximal exposure to equity markets may be 100% of net assets, with a total average exposure of 10% to 60%. The performance of the fund may be compared with the performance of the UBS Global Convertibles Indices Europe Hedged (EUR) index, which is calculated on the basis of coupons and/or dividends reinvested.
