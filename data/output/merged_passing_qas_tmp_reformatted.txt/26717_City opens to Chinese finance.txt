City opens to Chinese finance


At a time when the position of London as the major foreign offshore centre for the Chinese yuan outside Hong Kong has recently been strengthened, the Chinese and British authorities have announced three major agreements during a visit to China by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, Les Echos reports. Firstly, Chinese banks will be allowed to operate in the City as branches. The second agreement signed by the British delegation is an additional quota for direct investment in Chinese publicly-traded equities for British companies. Its maximum has been set at GBP8.2bn. Lastly, the two countries have agreed that the pound becomes the fourth currency, after the US dollar, the Australian dollar and the Japanese yen, to be allowed to be traded directly with the yuan, on markets in Shanghai and in licensed offshore centres. A timeline has not yet been set.
