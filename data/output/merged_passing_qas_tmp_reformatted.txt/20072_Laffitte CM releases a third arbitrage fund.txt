Laffitte CM releases a third arbitrage fund


Laffitte Capital Management is planning to launch an arbitrage fund based on indices. The fund, entitled Laffitte Index Arbitrage, will be a UCITS-compliant European product, and will aim to detect arbitrage opportunities on the global stock markets on the basis of indices. It will have complementary drivers of performance: arbitrage of index re-balancing, arbitrage on dividends, and also securities trading arbitrage.“With this fund, we return to one of our first loves. From 1990 to 2006, we used index-based arbitrage for proprietary trading at Crédit Mutuel-CIC,” explains Eric Robbe, co-founder and chairman of Laffittee CM. “But it had previously been difficult to realise this activity within a regulated and liquid fund, since many products were traded over the counter. In addition, there was disparate fiscal treatment of dividends throughout Europe. These obstacles have been removed today. As many banks are withdrawing from this profession, we also have expertise on the market,” he continues. Laffitte has recruited Gregory Meyappen for the fund; he had previously directed operations of this type for proprietary trading at Crédit Agricole. He will co-manage the fund with two colleagues from Laffitte CM. The fund has a capacity of up to EUR1bn. With daily liquidity, it will be on sale to clients of all types, and will have an institutional and a retail share class to this end. It will also be listed on life insurance platforms. With the Laffitte Index Arbitrage, the firm diversifies its range, which now consists of two merger and acquisition arbitrage funds. This may help the firm to reach its objective of EUR500bn. Five years after its launch, the firm currently has slightly under EUR300bn in assets under management, and 10 employees.
