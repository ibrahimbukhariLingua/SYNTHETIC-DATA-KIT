Sallie Krawcheck leaves Bank of America in management reshuffle


The banking group Bank of America, which is facing major difficulties, on 6 September announced a reshuffle of its management team, with the appointment of two new chief operations officers, David Darnell and Tom Montag, both internal promotions. Meanwhile, the current head of the banking services to individual and small business clients division, Joe Price, and the head of the wealth management and investment divisions, Sallie Krawcheck, a Wall Street star, will be “leaving the firm” the establishment says in a statement. The bank says the most aims to “align the operational units of the business with its three major groups of clients: individuals, businesses, and institutional investors.” Darnell becomes head of the divisions in charge of individual clients, while Montag will oversee the divisions in charge of medium to large businesses and institutional investors. The move marks “an important step in the transformation” of the business, says chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan, cited in a statement. “Removing a level in operations management” and “simplifying the organisation” will allow for “a significant reduction in costs,” among other measures, Bank of America states.
