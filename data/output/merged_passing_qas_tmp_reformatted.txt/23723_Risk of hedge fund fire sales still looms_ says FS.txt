Risk of hedge fund fire sales still looms, says FSA


The British Financial Services Authority (FSA) claims that there is still a systemic risk of fire sales of assets by distressed hedge funds during periods of market turbulence, according to its most recent study of the sector (“Assessing the possible sources of systemic risk from hedge funds.»)The most recent surveys by the FSA suggest that the footprint of hedge funds remains modest in most markets, with the possible exceptions of convertible bond, interest rate derivative and commodity derivative markets.For most hedge funds, leverage remains relatively low, and most funds estimate that they would be able to liquidate their assets more rapidly then the deadlines on their liabilities, which suggests that the transformation of maturities into liquidity is not highly developed. The FSA adds, however, that these estimates are not necessarily appropriate in times of market stress.Statistics also suggest that counterparties have increased their requirements in terms of margin calls, and toughened up the terms for hedge fund exposures since the financial crisis, which has increased resistance to hedge fund defaults.
