MF Global: bill rises to USD1.6bn


According to the New York court-appointed trustee James Giddens, the total amount of missing funds that need to be refunded to clients of MF Global is now estimated at USD1.6bn, the Wall Street Journal reports. A total of USD700m located in the United Kingdom have been added to the USD900m in commodities trading in the United States. These USD700m may be at the centre of legal battles with KPMG, which is in charge of overseeing the unwinding of MF Globalâ€™s division in the United Kingdom.
