Schroders takes over marketing for its European Alpha Plus fund


The British firm Schroders has begun to offer its European strategy European Alpha Plus, which it had decided to close to new investors in November 2011, Investment Week reports. The fund had then reached its capacity of EUR5bn. Assets in the fund were then reduced by significant proportions due to a disaffection with European equities related to the ongoing crisis in the euro zone. In the three years to 17 October, the fund has posted returns of 14.2%, compared with average returns of 3.6% for the European equity sector.
