Fund of hedge fund assets down 30%


Assets in funds of hedge funds fell to USD530bn as of the end of June 2009, from a peak of USD825bn. Between September 2008 and June 2009, the decline in assets totalled about USD200bn, which represents a decrease of about 30%, according to the Telegraph, citing a study by the Hedge Fund Journal and Newedge Prime Brokerage of the 50 largest funds of funds. This is a major crisis for the sector, whose assets increased by an average of more than 20% per year between 2000 and 2008. Most funds have lost an average of 25% to 30% of their assets, but some have seen even more major decreases. Among the latter, the Alternative Investments division of HSBC has seen a decline of 51.9% in its assets, to USD22.3bn. Only two providers of funds of funds have posted gains: Blackstone, whose funds have gained 25%, to USD25bn, and Grosvenor Capital Management, which has gained 1% to USD21bn.
