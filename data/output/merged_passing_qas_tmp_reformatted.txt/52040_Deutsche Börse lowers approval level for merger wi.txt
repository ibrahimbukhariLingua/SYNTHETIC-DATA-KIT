Deutsche Börse lowers approval level for merger with LSE


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The German stock market operator Deutsche Börse on 11 July indicated that it was lowering the level of approval required from its shareholders to merge with the British firm LSE from 75% previously to 60%, to increase the changes that the operation may succeed. The offer to Deutsche Börse shareholders will now run until 26 July. They will initially be required to redeem their shares by midnight on Tuesday, but the minimal approval level set by Deutsche Börse at 75% may not be reached in time. At the end of last week, ony about 25% of capital had been contributed. Deutsche Börse on Sunday evening explained that it is planning to lower the level in order to allow some shareholding funds, tracker funds, to participate in the operation. They are technically not able to contribute their shares until this level has been reached. Once the level is lowered, “we remove a technical obstacle,” the CFO of Deutsche Börse, Gregor Pottmeyer, says. But this initiative “has purely technical reasons,” he says. “We are persuaded that we will reach 75% during this process.” We may add, however, that the prospects of the United Kingdom pulling out of the European Union has complicated the picture for this operation, which was initially presented as a “merger among equals». Reticence is strong on the German side as to seeing the Frankfurt stock exchange directed from a country which is no longer a member of the EU. However, LSE shareholders already approved the principle of a merger by an overwhelming majority last week.
