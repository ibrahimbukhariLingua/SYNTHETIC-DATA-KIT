P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } A final vote will be held today in Strasbourg, which may cast the position adopted in March to strictly limit bonuses in the asset management sector, similarly to the limits that have already been imposed on bankers, into doubt, Les Echos reports.The Parliamentary committee on economic affairs decided that the variable portion of remuneration may not exceed the fixed portion, the same as the rule imposed on banks.An additional rule was added to take the specificities of asset management into account: performance commissions were disallowed, when a UCITS fund is open to retail investors. For funds restricted to professional investors, commissions would continue to be allowed, but could become maluses in the case of negative performance.
