ECMI publishes 2011 capital market statistics


The European Capital Markets Institute (ECMI) on 1 December announced the publication of its “2011 Statistical Package,” which covers the full range of European capital markets in the wake of the financial crisis. The body of statistics is divided into six major chapters: equity markets, debt markets, ETF markets, over-the-counter derivative markets, asset management, and comparative international data. The institute says that for the first time in 2011, statistics required by the MiFID directive for pan-European and national trading platforms have been included. The chapter on debt markets has been enlarged, with data on securitisations, while the asset management chapter now includes data on pension funds and insurance companies.
