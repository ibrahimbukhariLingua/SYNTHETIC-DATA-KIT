France - CAAM converts its regular money market funds to ESG-aware management


All regular money market OPCVM funds in the product range from Crédit Agricole Asset Management (CAAM) are now undergoing a process of ESG (environment, social and governance) filtering, said Patrick Simeon, head of bond management, on Tuesday. In principle, they satisfy all the criteria for IDEAM, the provider of extra-financial analysis for the group. Unlike other promoters, who have confronted some deficiencies relatively recently in the area of transparency, CAAM does not need to launch new products which are specifically ESG-aware. The management firm can simply incorporate an ESG constraint which will hardly modify its existing funds. The first will be a money market fund in the ?credit? category, probably by the end of first half.This type of product appears to interest a fairly varied client base, which includes institutionals, businesses, pension funds, and client associative structures of the Crédit Agricole and LCL networks.
