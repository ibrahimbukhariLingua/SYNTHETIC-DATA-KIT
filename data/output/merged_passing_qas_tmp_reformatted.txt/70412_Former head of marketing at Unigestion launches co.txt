Former head of marketing at Unigestion launches consulting firm


Jean-François Hirschel, formerly head of marketing and products at Unigestion, is launching a strategic consulting and marketing firm entitled H-Ideas, NewsManagers has learnt. The new agency, based in Geneva, advises companies throughout the fields of finance, technologies and fintech on their marketing strategy. It has a network of five consultants, and already includes Groupama Asset Management, La Banque Postale Asset Management and Sanso IS among its clients.“I created H-Ideas because I could see an increasing divergence between investors who feel that managers do not meet their expectations, and managers who are under increasingly intense pressure (regulatory, margins, difficulty managing in a low-interest rate environment, etc.),” Hirschel explains.“I am convinced that the managers who will be able to construct their strategy, positioning and language around the needs of their clients will be the ones who will be successful over the long term based on the long-term confidence which their clients will place in them. That is the way I have thought of my work at companies I have worked at in the past 20 years, and that is the experience I am now putting to the service of the industry with H-Ideas,” Hirschel adds.H-Ideas assists boards of directors, heads of marketing and distribution and heads of strategy with marketing positioning, maximizing success, and improving marketing organisation.
