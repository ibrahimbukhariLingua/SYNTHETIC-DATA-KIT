Richelieu Gestion recruits new manager


Richelieu Gestion is consolidating its teams with the arrival of David Autin, European equity manager, in parallel with the arrival of Benoît de Brie as head of multi-management, NewsManagers has learnt. The two new managers will be part of the team led by Alexandre Hezez, and will work to continue to add to the range developed by Richelieu Gestion. Autin began in the role on 2 May, while de Brie will begin from 20 May. The recruitments come as part of a new wave brought in by Christophe Boulanger since his arrival as head of the asset management firm. Driven by a desire to give Richelieu Gestion a breath of fresh air, Boulanger has undertaken a profound overhaul, which has brought in a new management team, with the recruitments of Laurence Adam (deputy CEO, recruited in November 2018), Michel Dinet (director of development, January 2019), and Hezez (director of financial management, strategist and allocator for the group, March 2019). After earning a BA in international business from the university of Brighton (2004) and an MA in finance from the NEOMA Business School (2005), Autin quickly specialised in the analysis and management of French and European small and midcaps, from his beginnings at Traditions Securities in 2005, and then at Berenberg Bank (2008-2010), Amalthee Gestion (2010-2014), Auris Gestion (2014-2017) and Pléiade Asset Management (2017 – 2019).
