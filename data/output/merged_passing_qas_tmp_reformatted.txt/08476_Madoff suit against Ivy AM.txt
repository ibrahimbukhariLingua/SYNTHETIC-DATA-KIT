Madoff suit against Ivy AM


Andrew Cuomo, the attorney general of New York, has filed a civil lawsuit against Ivy Asset Management (which in 2000 became an affiliate of BNY Mellon Asset Management), and two of its founders, Lawrence Simon and Howard Wohl, claiming that these individuals were aware of “disturbing facts” about the management firm led by Bernard Madoff, but that they “hid the truth” from clients to whom they recommended Madoff’s products.
