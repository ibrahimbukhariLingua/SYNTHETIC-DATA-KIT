The services company Research Affiliates, based in the United States, a specialist in smart beta strategies, has announced the launch of a new analytical tool, Smart Beta Interactive, which is presented as a website which makes information available to investors about factorial or smart beta strategies, including track records, relative valuations, estimates of potential for alpha, and other characteristics. “By going beyond track records, Smart Beta Interactive will be useful to the investment community by providing a more robust toolbox which puts the emphasis on projections of future performance on the basis of relative valuations and transaction costs,” a statement says.
