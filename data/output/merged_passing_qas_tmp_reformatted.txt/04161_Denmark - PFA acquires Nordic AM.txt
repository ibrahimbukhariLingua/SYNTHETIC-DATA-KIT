Denmark - PFA acquires Nordic AM


PFA Pension in 2008 earned pre-tax profits of SEK3.5bn, or EUR460m, on its investments, thanks to an increase to its allocation to bonds, IPE reports. This has allowed the insurer (SEK219bn in assets) to acquire Nordic Asset Management (SEK28bn), making the firm able to offer asset management services to institutional investors.
