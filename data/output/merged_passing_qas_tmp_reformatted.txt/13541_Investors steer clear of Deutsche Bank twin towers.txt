Investors steer clear of Deutsche Bank twin towers


According to financial industry sources, investors have been hesitant to acquire shares in the closed real estate fund DWS Access Deutsche Bank TÃ¼rme, to which Deutsche Bank sold its freshly renovated twin tower headquarters in Frankfurt in March for EUR600m, Handelsblatt reports. Clients are not concerned that returns will be on the weak side, at only 5% per year, because the tenant is financially solid, the lease is very long-term and the properties are of high quality.
