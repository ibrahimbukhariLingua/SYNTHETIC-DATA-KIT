Bono’s fund buys 1% stake in Facebook


Elevation Partners, an investment fund in which Bono, the singer for the group U2, is one of the shareholders, at the end of 2009 bought a 1% stake in the social network Facebook for USD90m, Cinco Días reports. Facebook has declined to comment. In early 2010, Elevation Partners went on to invest USD25m in Yelp, a social networking startup; the fund has since confirmed its plans to increase its investment in the firm to USD100m.
