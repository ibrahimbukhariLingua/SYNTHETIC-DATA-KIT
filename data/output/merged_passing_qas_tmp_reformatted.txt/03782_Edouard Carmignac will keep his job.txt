Edouard Carmignac will keep his job


In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, Edouard Carmignac states that he is 62 years old, and that his work still gives him pleasure, and that he is planning to stay on board. But he is naturally thinking about the future. The important thing is for the management firm (EUR14bn in 16 funds), and with it, the team, should remain independent in their decisions. Next year, his daughter may return to the business. Carmignac says she is certainly a candidate to succeed him, but that others also stand a good chance.
