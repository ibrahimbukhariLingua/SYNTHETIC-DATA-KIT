Madoff: US courts demand HSBC accounts


Les Echos reports that the US bankruptcy judge Burton Lifland is asking the London High Court to force HSBC to release a range of documents touching on the firm’s relations with the brokerage firm controlled by Bernard Madoff, from reports to registrations and contracts, ordered by the auditor KPMG. Like the Swiss bank UBS, London-based HSBC was a depository for feeder funds supplying the former US broker’s network of frauds. The funds concerned include the Luxembourg-registered Herald and the Irish-registered Thema. Three months before the arrest of the author of frauds estimated at USD50bn, KPMG wrote reports on behalf of HSBC on the fraud and the operational risks at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, according to the summary judgement. HSBC declined to comment on the reports to Bloomberg. A hearing is scheduled for 4 November in New York.
