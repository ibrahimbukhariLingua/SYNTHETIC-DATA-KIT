Director of LSE comments on announced move of Euronext


Xavier Rollet, CEO of the London Stock Exchange (LSE), has commented in an interview with Agence France Presse (AFP) on the announcement by NYSE Euronext of its plans to move the servers for its electronic trading platforms in France to south-east England. He says traditional markets now have no choice but to modernise their technologies. “Infrastructure follows clients. If you want to convince Euronext to return to Paris, you need to attract clients, particularly hedge funds,” says Rollet.
