Feri: Managers predict that 2010 will be the year of emerging markets


A survey of 67 management firms undertaken between 22 March and 12 April by Feri EuroRating Services has found that 85% of respondents are expecting an increase in assets allocated to emerging markets. Emerging markets equities funds have the best potential for inflows, according to 14.1% of respondents, while 13.3% say that emerging market bond funds have the best chances. However, the asset classes which are said to have the highest odds of outflows are corporate bonds (by 24.7% of respondents) and inflation-indexed bonds (by 15.3%). European equities funds are said by only 10.7% of respondents to have favourable prospects for asset inflows.In general, 86% of managers surveyed have positive outlooks about the chances for inflows to diversified funds, and 78% say they have a positive opinion of the prospects for equities funds. However, no trend is apparent for bond funds, and professionals are pessimistic about money market and real estate funds, which are said to have limited potential on the distribution front. According to respondents in the survey, foreign management firms are best positioned to take advantage of the wave of investment in emerging markets. JPMorgan AM was most often cited as an important competitor in the area of equities funds, followed by Aberdeen, HSBC and Schroders, who share third place. For bond funds, managers cite Pictet as their major rival, followed by Swiss & Global, Franklin Templeton, and Schroders.
