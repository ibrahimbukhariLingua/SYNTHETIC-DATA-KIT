Solactive and Equileap launch indices dedicated to promoting gender equality


The index provider Solactive and the Equileap organisation, which promotes gender equality in the workplace, have teamed up to launch a new family of indices which monitor companies which practice gender-balanced promotion. The range includes three indices, the Solactive Equileap Global Gender Equality Index. The indices will be used as underlying baskets to develop ETFs and structured products.All of the indices, which offer exposures to various geographical regions, use the same methodology for the central theme of the line. Equileap collects information about over 3,000 companies listed in 23 countries, and ranks them according to 19 gender equality criteria, including leadership, careers, work/life balance, remuneration, holidays, and health and safety issues. Solactive has constructed indices based on traditional liquidity criteria and ESG and typological filters supplied by Equileap.
