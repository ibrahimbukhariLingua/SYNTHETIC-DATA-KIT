Austria - Bank Medici transferred its commissions into Swiss accounts


?The fate of Bank Medici is sealed. The Viennese firm will be closed in a few weeks,? repeated the members of a special task force at Himmepfortgasse 8, the headquarters of the Austrian finance ministry, Il Sole - 24 Ore reports. According to the newsmagazine Format, Sonja Kohn, chairwoman of the bank, made EUR50m per year from commissions earned on the sale of Madoff funds. But, according to the Austrian authorities, in 2007, only EUR4-5m in commissions were registered on the books. The remainder is reported to have been transferred into Swiss accounts.
