Schroders plans to develop in Switzerland


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The British Schroders group is planning to build its presence in significant proportions on the Swiss market, where it already has more than 250 employees, the head of Schroders, Michael Dobson, has told the newspaper NZZ. The development of activities in Switzerland is already a consequence of the acquisition of Cazenove in July 2013, as the administrative services from Cazenove will now all be executed in Switzerland. Dobson has also emphasized that unlike what is being done in many other countries, Schroder Investment Management in Switzerland has not only a distribution team, but also eight investment desks, from which it is possible to manage funds.
