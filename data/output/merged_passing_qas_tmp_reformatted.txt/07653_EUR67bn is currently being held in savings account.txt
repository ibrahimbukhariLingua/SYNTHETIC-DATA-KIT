EUR67bn is currently being held in savings accounts or under the mattress


According to a survey of a representative sample of 1,005 people aged 16-65, conducted by Forsa Institut on behalf of Skandia Lebensversicherung, “Germans are bad at saving.” 28% of those surveyed said that they had set aside more than EUR5,000 either in a savings account or under the mattress. Extrapolated to account for all Germans in the age ranges considered (48 million people), that would represent at least EUR67bn in the country as a whole. The proportion of respondents aged 45-65 who have savings of this kind is as much as 34.5%.
