Real estate funds of funds obliged to liquidate their positions


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The recently-passed bill regulating open-ended real estate funds is slated to come into force at the start of 2011. But the legislation is flawed, as the government forgot to make real estate funds of funds subject to the same terms as real estate funds, Handelsblatt reports. This means that funds of funds may have to redeem their shares on a daily basis, though they would be invested in real estate funds which would lock in their money for at least two years. Some real estate funds of funds are therefore beginning to liquidate their positions in order to remain sufficiently liquid.
