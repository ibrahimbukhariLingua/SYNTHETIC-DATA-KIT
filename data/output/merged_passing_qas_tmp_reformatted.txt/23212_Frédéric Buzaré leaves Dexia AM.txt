Frédéric Buzaré is leaving Dexia Asset Management, where since 2007 he had served as global head of equities, and then as an equity strategist. “The decisions of our equity strategists will not be impacted by the departure. They remain in line with our principle of having dedicated and specialised teams which are responsible for decisions, under the direction of Vincent Hamelink, global head of traditional investments,” a spokesperson for the asset management firm says. The name of his replacement has not yet been announced. Buzaré has joined the Singapore sovereign fund GIC, according to reports in Les Echos. “He will be a senior manager in the European equities team. He will begin in his position at the end of April, first in London, and then in the Asian capital,” the finance newspaper reports. Before joining Dexia AM, Buzaré was senior equity fund manager at Axa Investment Managers and BNP Paribas Asset Management, according to his LinkedIn profile.
