SEC issues warning to Regions Financial


Regions Financial Corp has announced that it has received a ‘Wells notice’ that it faces fines for possible violations of federal securities regulations, the Wall Street Journal reports. The notice related to three bond funds managed by James Kelsoe at Morgan Asset Management, an affiliate of Morgan Keegan which is itself an affiliate of Regions Financial. The funds have lost an average of 59.5% in the 12 months to 30 April 2008. They were dragged down by their exposure to CDO and mortgages. Regions Financial states that the management of the funds has since been transferred to Hyperion Brookfield Asset Management.
