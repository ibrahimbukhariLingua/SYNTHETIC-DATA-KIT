Tax scandal: More data stolen from Julius Baer


The private bank Julius Baer has once again been the victim of theft of banking information, Sonntagszeitung reports. An employee of the firm suspected of the theft was arrested and subsequently released. The bank had no comment on the quantity of data stolen, which has been transmitted to Germany. The theft was discovered due to “strengthened control mechanisms and an internal investigation,” the CEO of Julius Baer tells the German newspaper. The stolen banking information had apparently been copied onto a CD-ROM, and sent to the tax authorities of the German region of Rhenania-North Westphalia. The tax authorities in that region had previously, in October 2010, acquired a CD containing data from Julius Baer. They paid about EUR1.5m for the disc, containing information on 200 clients of the bank, including Germans who were dodging taxes in the country.
