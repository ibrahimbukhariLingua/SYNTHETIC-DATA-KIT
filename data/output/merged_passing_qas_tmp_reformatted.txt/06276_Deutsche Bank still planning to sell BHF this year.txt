Deutsche Bank still planning to sell BHF this year


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Stefan Krause, CFO of Deutsche Bank, has told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that the firm is still planning to sell BHF-Bank by the end of this year. Talks have been held with several potential buyers. Deutsche Bank would like to sell the Sal. Oppenheim affiliate as a whole in a single transaction. According to sources familiar with the matter, only LGT is said to be inclined to pay a price close to EUR650m, the book value of BHF. Among the other candidates are Apollo, the Hinduja group and perhaps also KKR, which at one time had teamed up with the Lampe private bank.
