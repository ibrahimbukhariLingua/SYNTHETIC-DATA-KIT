Cantonal bank of Zurich under pressure


The regulatory tsunami in the banking sector is one of the most difficult challenges facing the Cantonal Bank of Zurich (ZKB), the CEO of the bank, Martin Scholl, says.In an interview with finews. Scholl remarks that in comparison to this regulatory tsunami, which may be necessary but which could be put in place with more discernment to avoid distortions to competition, “pressure on margins is a small problem.” Alongside measure to optimise structures and processes, the head of the cantonal bank does not rule out limited staff cutbacks.In relation to the taxation quarrel with the United States, the bank, which is co-operating with the US authorities as part of a “constructive dialogue,” is hoping to reach an agreement “as soon as possible.” In relation to plans for a tax agreement with Germany, which is in the hands of mediators, Scholl says he is optimistic, and says that a final rejection by the German government would from his point of view be a missed opportunity to find a “balanced and sustainable” solution to a taxation issue which divides the two countries.
