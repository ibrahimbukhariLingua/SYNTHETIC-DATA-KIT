These sub-funds can be created rapidly and sold independently,” a statement says.Should they take advantage of the considerably reduced launching and operating costs, asset management firms have a more profitable solution at their disposal than the creation of an independent funds. Funds also have additional services offered by Gateway, such as auditing and general secretary services.Asset management fiirms are assisted throughout the administrative process, from the application for a license from the Central Bank of Ireland to analysis of distribution needs for local markets. As soon as a license is received, the funds receive distrbution support services offered by SGSS through its European local agents and paying agents. Additionally, SGSS also offers fund administration, transfer agency, custody and depository banking services, as well as auxiliary services such as the production of Key Investor Information Documents (KIID).
