To meet demand from investors who are increasingly concerned about the risk of rising interest rates, State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) has launched a very short-term bond ETF, in a niche in which net subsriptions have already reached USD9.4bn in the first nine months of the year, according to Morningstar.This time it is an actively-managed ETF, the SSgA Ultra Short Term Bond ETF (ticker: ULST), listed on the NYSE Arca platform since 10 October, which offers investors access to a diversified portfolio of bonds with ultra-short term durations. The product allows clients to earn additional returns without sacrificing liquidity, says James Ross, senior managing director and global head of SPDR ETFs at SSgA.The fund charges fees of 0.20%.
