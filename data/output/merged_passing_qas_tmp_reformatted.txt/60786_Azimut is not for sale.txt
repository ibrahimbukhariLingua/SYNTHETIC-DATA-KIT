Azimut is not for sale


“Azimut is not for sale,” Pietro Giuliani, chairman of Azimut Holding, has said in an interview released on Milano Finanza, in the wake of rumours of possible interest on the part of major groups in the Italian network of financial advisers and private bankers. “Let me take this occasion to repeat that Azimut is not for sale. So, if someone’s objective is to contain the share price in order to be able to put the company at a low price, we say clearly that, in our view, these shares are worth no less than EUR50, and we are convinced that by the end of the industrial plan, thus within a maximum of two and a half years, Azimut will achieve this value on the stock market,” the director says. Shares are now trading at less than EUR18 on the Milan stock exchange as of 13 June.
