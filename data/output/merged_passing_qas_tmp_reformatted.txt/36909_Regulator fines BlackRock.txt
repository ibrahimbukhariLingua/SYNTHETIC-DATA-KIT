p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } The Italian financial market regulator, Consob, has fined BlackRock, the largest fund mangement firm in the world, EUR150,000, for market manipulation, Reuters reports. BlackRock was found guilty by Consob of falsely reporting a reduction of its stake in the Italian bank UniCredit, which was preparing to launch a capital increase. The BlackRock group on Thursday stated that it would accept the fine from the Italian regulator, adding that it had made a “technical error” when it declared a reduction of its stake in UniCredit bank to less than 2%.
