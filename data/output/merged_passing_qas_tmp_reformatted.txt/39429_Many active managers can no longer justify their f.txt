Many active managers can no longer justify their fees


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } To what extend is your manager active, and what chance does he really have of beating the market, asks the Financial Times? These questions are related. A measurement of the deviation of managers from their benchmark indices can help to predict which funds will outperform. The measurement is called “active share” - the part of the portfolio of a fund which differs from its benchmark index. A well-managed tracker fund will have an active share of 0, and an esoteric fund which will contain no shares from the index will have an active share of 100. The concept was popularised by university professors Martijn Cremers and Antti Petajisto, who have made two important discoveries. Firstly, closet indexing, in which funds limit underperformance risk by staying close to the index, has become widespread in the United States. Secondly, the larger the active share of a fund is, the more chance it has of beating its index. Funds which charge active management fees but which barely stray from the index have difficulty justifying these fees. Due to the implications this may have, the fund management industry in the United States and Europe is seeking to discredit the concept.
