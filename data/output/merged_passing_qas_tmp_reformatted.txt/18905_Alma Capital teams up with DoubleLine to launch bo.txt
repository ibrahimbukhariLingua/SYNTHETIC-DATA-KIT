Alma Capital teams up with DoubleLine to launch bond fund


The Luxembourg Sicav Alma Capital Investment Funds (an affiliate of the French firm Alma Capital), which already has a sub-fund with USD23m managed by Shenkman Capital Management since the end of 2011 (see Newsmanagers of 16 December 2011), has added a new UCITS IV-compliant managed by the US firm DoubleLine, led by Jeff Gundlach, entitled Alma DoubleLine Core Plus Bond. The fund will open for subscriptions on 22 October.The fund will invest in a wide range of bond and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), a market in which the managers at DoubleLine (USD45bn in assets) are specialised, and which accounts for slightly over one third of assets for the strategy, government bonds, and corporate bonds from the US and other developed and emerging countries.With the new fund, which will have about 330 positions, DoubleLine will provide European investors with a choice of management similar to its Core Plus strategy (nearly USD3bn), which it already offers to US clients in the form of mandates or mutual funds, with the Aston Core Plus (USD169.8m) fund and a RiverNorth fund, Loren Fleckenstein, a research analyst at the US firm, explains to Newsmanagers.The strategy combines dynamic allocation on the basis of fundamental analysis of the various sectors with rigorous stock-picking. The idea is to construct a portfolio which “performs” well in all market situations, while, according to Gundlach, “you can only make money in bonds slowly, while you may lose it very fast.” DoubleLine “endeavours to take less risks for the same amount of returns.”So far, the fund is licensed only in Luxembourg, in institutional share classes.
