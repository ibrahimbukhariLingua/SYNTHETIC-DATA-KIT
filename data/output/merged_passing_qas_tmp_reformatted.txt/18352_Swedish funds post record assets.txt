Swedish funds post record assets


In October, funds on sale in Sweden reached record assets of SEK1.97trn (EUR230bn), the highest level ever recorded by the Swedish fund association (Fondbolagens FÃ¶rening), which nonetheless states that this record level was reached once previously, in May 2011. In October, funds posted net subscriptions of SEK6.6bn. Inflows were driven by balanced funds (SEK2.9bn), bond funds (SEK3.4bn) and money market funds (SEK3.4bn). However, equity funds have seen outflows of SEK2.9bn. Funds invested in Swedish equities have primarily suffered from these outflows (SEK3bn). Since the beginning of this year, funds on sale in Sweden have posted net inflows of SEK17.7bn, largely driven by bond funds (SEK16.1bn), and to a lesser extent by balanced funds (SEK8.9bn).
