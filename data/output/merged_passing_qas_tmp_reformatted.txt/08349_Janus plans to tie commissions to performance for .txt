Janus plans to tie commissions to performance for eight more funds


Janus Capital Group is planning to introduce performance commissions for 10 of its mutual funds, according to MutualFundWire. Janus already applies performance commissions for 14 of its funds, out of a total of over 100. The new commission structure, which will be put up for a shareholder vote on 10 June, would apply to the Janus Forty Fund, Janus Fund, Janus Global Opportunities Fund, Janus Overseas Fund, Janus Twenty Fund, Aspen Forty Fund, Aspen Fund, Aspen Global Opportunities Fund, Aspen Overseas Fund and Aspen Twenty Fund. If the proposal is passed, Janus would charge set fees of 64 basis points per fund, plus a commission of up to 15 basis points depending on performance over a 36-month period.
