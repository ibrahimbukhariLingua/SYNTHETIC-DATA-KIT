CME wants to open a derivatives exchange in London


The US firm CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) is in talks with the British Financial Services Authority (FSA) over a launch of a derivatives exchange based in London, Les Echos reports. CME, which opened a clearing-house in London last year, is hoping to be able to begin its activities by the middle of next year, initially with futures contracts on currency markets, and potentially trading of other products subsequently. The Chicago-based operator is hoping to rival Eurex and Liffe, both of which are operating in London, at a time when regulators are moving to impose ruled on over-the-counter trading.
