Lyxor reported to have poached a top head from iShares


On Tuesday, due to the relevant authorized persons being on holiday, Lyxor Asset Management was not able to confirm to Newsmanagers reports in several British media sources that the asset manager has recruited Nizam Hamid, head of sales strategy at iShares Europe since November 2008. Hamid would take over responsibility for global ETF sales, which Dan Draper left behind to join Credit Suisse (see Newsmanagers of 9 February), and which were taken over for the interim by Isabelle Bourcier. Apparently, Bourcier will retain her role as global head of ETFs at Lyxor AM, as part of her responsibilities as head of marketing & sales for listed products at Société Générale.
