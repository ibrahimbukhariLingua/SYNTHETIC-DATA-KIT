How to exit from crisis: major management firms each have their own ideas


The major asset management firms are adopting various strategies to exit from the crisis, Expansi√≥n reports. According to the New York Times, JPMorgan Asset Management, for example, has chosen to recruit sales staff to increase its assets, particularly internationally, with the objective of doubling net profits in five years. For its part, Fidelity International, according to Ignites Europe, will change its international image and will become known as Fidelity Investment Managers, with a new logo which will be unveiled later this year. BlackRock has invested the most in the hopes of pulling out of the crisis, particularly with the acquisition last year of Barclays Global Investors and its iShares brand. Another major player in the sector, Pimco, has changed strategies, and has launched its first equities fund, though it had previously been a specialist in bonds. Throughout Europe, the major French groups are the most active, with Amundi and Natixis the best-positioned to acquire Pioneer from UniCredit. Other firms are betting on the quality of their products to drive growth. Carmignac, and also M&G, are following this route.
