Aviva Investors France bets on European equities


Aviva Investors France is not giving way to panic; quite the opposite. Despite a difficult economic and political environment, the asset management firm of the Aviva group does not subscribe to a scenario of a double-dip recession, nor does it predict that the euro zone will implode. It has even chosen to invest in risky assets, more particularly equities. Compared with a balanced portfolio composed of 50% equities and 50% bonds and money markets, with a preference for the European market and overweight positions on the banking and industrial sectors, “the equity markets, which have integrated an extremely pessimistic scenario, are inexpensive. There are very good points of entry, particularly on the European market, which is completely undervalued. That’s the market we are preferring currently,” says Pascal Heurtault. In terms of credit, Heurtault steers clear of German government bonds and is neutral on Spanish and Italian bonds. He prefers corporate issues, particularly from the banking sector. “We are lucky to belong to a major insurance company, which has made us safe from major redemptions,” says Heurtault. Aviva Investors France can therefore confront and consider long-term investments. “Our parent company is confident in our management teams, which have been in place for many years. We know that we have to accept some temporary declines, as this is a difficult period, but it will allow us to prepare for future gains,” says the chief investment officer at Aviva Investors France.
