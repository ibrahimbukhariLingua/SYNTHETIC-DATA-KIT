Regulators sound alarm over Patrimoine Gestion Management


Following several reports, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) and the Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution (ACPR) have warned the public against the activities of Patrimoine Gestion Management and PGM Patrimoine and related sites, which have been offering investment services without a license. These entities and the websites www.patrimoinegestion-management.com and www.pgm-patrimoine.com “are not licensed either by the AMF or the ACPR to provide investment services or savings packets,” the two regulators say in a statement. The authorities recommend that investors not respond to solicitations from them, and not to disseminate these to third parties.
