Barclays Cap may offer indices for Chinese ETFs


On Monday, Barclays Capital signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Shanghai stock exchange, by the terms of which the investment bank of the Barclays group will become the first licensed provider of global bond indices in China, the Wall Street Journal reports. Currently, according to Waqas Samad, head of index, portfolio and risk solutions at Barclays Cap, the British firm is in talks with several Chinese fund managers who are planning to launch ETFs to invest in foreign bond products using Barclays indices as benchmarks. But the Chinese regulator will still need to license these managers to issue ETF products under the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors (QDII) regime to allow Chinese subscribers to invest in funds based on foreign indices directly in China.
