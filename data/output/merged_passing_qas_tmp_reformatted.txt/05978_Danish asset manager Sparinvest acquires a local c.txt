Danish asset manager Sparinvest acquires a local competitor


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Sparinvest group on 29 November announced that it has acquired the fund management activities of its Danish rival EgnsINVEST. “The sale, which is expected to be finalised in spring 2011, confirms Sparinvest as one of the asset management leaders in Denmark. Sparinvest also strengthens its sales base and realises economies of sale,” says a statement from the Danish group. The Danish management firm Sparinvest is taking control of all investment activities by the Danish management firm EgnsINVEST. The acquisition reflects a synergy between the two independent asset management firms. It si also a reaction to changes in the Danish banking sector, which are leading to a wave of consolidation among the smaller players. Since Sparinvest and EgnsINVEST operate as independent asset management firms, retail banks are their major distribution channel. Once the deal is approved by the supervisory authorities and shareholders in general assembly, investment products from EgnsINVEST, with assets under management valued at about EUR700m, will be merged with the product range from Sparinvest in spring 2011. When the acquisition is completed, Sparinvest will manage assets totalling about EUR9.4bn, firmly positioning the Sparinvest group as one of the asset management leaders in Denmark.
