Europe - BlackRock buying bonos


Cinco DÃ­as reports that the US management firm BlackRock has begun to buy Spanish government bonds (bonos) since their spread compared with German bonds (bunds) has hit a ten-year high. It is also interested in Italian and Greek debt, as current prices reflect a 10-20% chance of a disintegration of the Euro zone.
