Kommalpha: institutional investors heading for health sector


According to a survey of 60 German institutional investors, of whom 17% have assets of over EUR10bn, the Kommalpha agency has found that professionals are clearly intending to increase their exposure to the health sector. 68% of them say this taste is due to a megatrend which profits the sector, while 50% are attracted by the potential for growth, and only 29% cite an attractive return/risk ratio as a motive in their investment decision, while 15% explain it as related to the low correlation of the sector with other asset classes. The three best-known funds in the sector are the BB Biotech Lux from Bellevue Asset Management (cited by 56% of those surveyed), the PF (Lux) Biotech I from Pictet Funds, and the DWS Biotech-Aktien from DWS, cited by 50% and 46%, respectively.
