Denham will be based in London, and will be repsonsible for managing the European funds Carmignac Grande Europe and Carmignac Euro-Patrimoine, which represent a total of EUR418m in assets under management (as of 31 May 2016). Before joining Carmignac, Denham worked for 13 years at Aviva Investors in London, where he was responsible for managing European equity funds, and had EUR5bn in assets under management, in mandates from 2004, and in open funds from 2012. His management is characterised by low turnover rates and controlled volatility, a statement says. He had previously been head of European equity funds at Insight Investment and at National Mutual Life.The recruitment of Denham comes following the departure of Muhammed Yesilhark, head of European equities, at the beginning of the year “for personal reasons,” according to an article in the Financial Times in March. According to the London newspaper, the departure of the manager was the result of an internal investigation initiated last year against him and his colleage Mate Heininger, following transactions with the controversial businessman Lars Windhorst and his company Sapinda in September 2014.
