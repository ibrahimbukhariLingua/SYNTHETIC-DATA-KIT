Liontrust soon to launch a value fund


The British management firm Liontrust Asset Management will next month launch the European Value Fund, which will be compliant with the UCITS III directive. Investment Week reports that the fund will be managed by two former GAM managers, Ross Hollyman and Rob Cornish, who joined Liontrust last October. At the time of the launch, the fund will have about 70 positions, selected from a universe of 1,300 firms. The managers give priority to the search for pan-European high quality, liquid and inexpensive shares.
