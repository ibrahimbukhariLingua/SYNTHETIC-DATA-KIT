Donner &amp; Reuschel offers a strategy dedicated to high-level sport


The German private bank Donner & Reuschel, based in Hamburg, has launched a fund dedicated to high-level sport, which offers institutional investors access to profits derived from media rights, and to real estate and private equity stakes in sport. The fund is being launched in partnership with the consulting firm Sports Advisory International, based in Munich, whose two representatives, Robert Niemann and Martin Wolf, will act as advisors. “With this innovative strategy, we are giving investors access to a new asset class, hitherto reserved for major venture capital firms and companies,” says Thomas Ronfeld, head of primary markets at Donner & Reuschel.The fund will invest primarily in the commercial part of sport activities, with a priority on rights for football and leisure: rebroadcasting rights, stakes in clubs, sport infrastructure, equipment and training centres for high-level athletes. Donner & Reuschel has a size objective of EUR200m, with a minimum investment of EUR1m, and annual returns hoped to be 8% before costs for a life cycle until 2028.
