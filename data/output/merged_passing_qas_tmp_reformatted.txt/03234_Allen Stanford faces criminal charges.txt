Allen Stanford faces criminal charges


The US Department of Justice announced on Friday that it is pressing criminal charges against the financier R. Allen Stanford, who was arrested on Thursday. The authorities are also filing charges against four people accused of acting as his accomplices, and against Leroy King, chairman of the Financial Services Regulatory Commission (FSRC) of Antigua and Barbuda. The Wall Street Journal reports that the defendants are accused of operating a Ponzi scheme totalling USD7bn. The criminal charges come in addition to a civil suit filed by the SEC. King is accused of accepting USD100,000 in bribes to provide false information to the SEC, in his official capacity as a regulator.
