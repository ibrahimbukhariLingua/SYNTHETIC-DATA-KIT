Staff exodus from UBS Germany


The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports that 21 advisors and analysts specialised in high net worth client management are leaving UBS Germany to join Harald Quandt Trust (USD10bn) this autumn, while other employees are leaving but have not been recruited by the family office.Two different explanations are offered for the massive exodus. Some say it is due to former employees of the wealth management firm Sauerborn, which was acquired by UBS in late 2004 (and in which Harald Quandt Trust held a stake), never fully integrated into the business culture at the Swiss group. UBS, for its part, says that the departing employees did not adhere to the new strategic orientation for the operation, announced a few months ago.
