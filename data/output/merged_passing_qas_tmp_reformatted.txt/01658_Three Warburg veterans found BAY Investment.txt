Three Warburg veterans found BAY Investment


Bernd Bogmeier, a managing partner at the MM Warburg private bank until the end of 2008, has founded the investment boutique BAY Investment in Eschborn (near Frankfurt), in collaboration with Achim Hammerschmitt, who was previously director of asset allocation at Warburg Invest, and Youngjun Yoon, former CI of Warburg Invest. The acronym “BAY” comes from the first initials of the three founders. The new boutique will start up with assets of EUR1bn, and will offer quantitative fundamental products to both institutional and retail clients.
