Investec takes control of Evolution


The South African group Investec has signed an agreement to acquire the British firm Evolution for a total of GBP233m. The operation will allow Investec to develop both in wealth management activities, with William de Broe, and in investment banking (Evolution Securities). Last month, William de Broe acquired BNP Paribas Private Investment Management (formerly Fortis PIM) from BNP Paribas Wealth Management. Assets under management at BNP Paribas PIM total about GBP1.8bn, which brings assets at William de Broe to about GBP7.8bn (see Newsmanagers of 9 August 2011).
