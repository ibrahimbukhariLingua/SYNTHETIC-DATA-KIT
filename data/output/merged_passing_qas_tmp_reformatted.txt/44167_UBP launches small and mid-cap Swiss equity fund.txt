UBP launches small and mid-cap Swiss equity fund


Swiss asset management group Union Bancaire Privée has launched a new fund focused on the small and medium-cap segment of its domestic market, Citywire Global can reveal. The UBAM – Swiss Small and Mid-Cap Equity fund follows the same strategy as the UBAM Swiss Equity fund, but will target lesser known and smaller names.Eleanor Taylor Jolidon, who runs the Swiss equity fund, is the lead manager of the new fund, while Martin Moeller will also serve as a portfolio manager. UBP said the newly-launched Swiss small and mid-cap fund, which was formally unveiled on July 10, is intended for investors who prefer a Luxembourg-domiciled Ucits-compliant fund.The new fund will concentrate on global household names in a similar vein to Nestlé, Swatch and Cartier, but smaller-capitalised companies which are proven market leaders in niche segments.The fund is currently for sale in Luxembourg and Switzerland but will be available in more countries at the end of August.
