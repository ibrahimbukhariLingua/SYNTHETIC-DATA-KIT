Inflows to ETPs to set new records in 2014


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Global ETPs attracted USD40.1bn to lift year-to-date asset gathering into record territory at USD267.9bn, with investors returning to equities after Octoberâ€™s stock market correction boosted fixed income, according to estimates released by BlackRock. The record of USD262bn, set in 2012, is also expected to be surpassed. US equities brought in USD36.1bn concentrated in large cap funds as the outlook for the U.S. economy improved and slowing global growth led to accommodative central bank activity in other regions. Japanese equity ETPs listed in the U.S. and Europe accumulated USD4.1bn in response to announcements of expanded stimulus and GPIF equity purchases, though Japan-listed funds saw offsetting outflows following a significant stock rally. The start of ECB bond purchases, and commitment to further action should inflation fail to adjust upward, helped European fixed income inflows reach USD2.0bn, predominantly in investment grade corporate debt.
