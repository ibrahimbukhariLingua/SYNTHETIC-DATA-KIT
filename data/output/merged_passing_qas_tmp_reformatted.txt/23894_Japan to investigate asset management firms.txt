Japan to investigate asset management firms


The Japanese financial regulatory will investigate the 263 asset management firms in the country, after one of them, AIJ Investment Advisors, revealed that it had lost JPY200bn (about USD2.5bn) in assets entrusted to it. The asset management firm admitted that it could not explain to investors what had happened to their money. The regulator has ordered AIJ, which managed the pension assets of over 100 businesses, to cease its activities for a month, while the countryâ€™s surveillance commission continued its investigation of the structure.
