Buffettâ€™s heir apparent resigns


David Sokol, the heir apparent to Warren Buffett as head of Berkshire Hathaway, has resigned, Agefi reports. Acquisitions of shares in the Lubrizol chemical group in his own name before Berkshire was able to take control of the company in a deal strenuously encouraged by Sokol are said to have been the cause of the rift.
