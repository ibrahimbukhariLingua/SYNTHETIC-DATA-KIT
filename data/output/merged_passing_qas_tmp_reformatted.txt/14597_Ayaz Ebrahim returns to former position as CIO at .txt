Ayaz Ebrahim returns to former position as CIO at Amundi


Ray Jovanovich, CIO at Amundi Asia in Hong Kong, will soon be retiring, and Ayaz Ebrahim will be replacing him in the position, Asian Investor reports. Ebrahim, currently CIO at HSBC Asset Management in Hong Kong, held the position of CIO at Crédit Agricole Asset Management until 2002, until Jovanovich replaced him. He is thus returning to his old job, though Ebrahim’s responsibilities will now be wider, as he will also become vice CEO for equities and balanced mandates.
