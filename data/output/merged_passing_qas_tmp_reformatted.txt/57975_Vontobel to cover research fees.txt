Vontobel to cover research fees


The Swiss private bank Vontobel Asset Management on 18 October announced that it has decided to cover the costs of research for all of its funds and client mandates which fall within the scope of the MiFID 2 directive. “With this decision, we are adding clarity for our clients, and making our cost structure more transparent. We also hope that investment decisions which rely on more targeted research will profit the client,” says Axel Schwarzer, head at Vontobel Asset Management.Additional costs related to the decision, totalling a few million Swiss francs, have already been accounted for in the 2020 objectives presented in late August 2017, the statement says.
