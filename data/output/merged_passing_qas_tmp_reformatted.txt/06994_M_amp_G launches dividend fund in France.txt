M&amp;G launches dividend fund in France


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Paris office of M&G will release the M&G Global Dividend Fund, a fund which invests in businesses worldwide which are increasing their dividends, in France. The product, launched in July 2008, with assets of EUR404m, will be aimed at institutional and retail investors. The manager, Stuart Rhodes, will aim to invest in businesses which have consistently increased their dividends over time. He says firms which adhere to such a discipline tend to avoid misspending their money, and are instead more selective in their growth initiatives. Rhodes focuses less on returns, which he says are only a form of historical data, and give no indication of the capacity of businesses to pay dividends in the future.
