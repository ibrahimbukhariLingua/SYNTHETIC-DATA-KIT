New private equity firm founded in Switzerland


The Swiss market has a new private equity firm, Enki Capital, based in Nyon, and co-founded by Joel Houmard and Vincent Oswald. The firm has announced on its LinkedIn profile that it will advise the Enki Swiss Opportunity fund, which will invest in companies in the lower end of the Swiss mid-market (valuations from CHF5m to CHF25m). Enki Capital estimates that about one fifth of the 58,000 Swiss companies in this segment will be changing owners in the next five years.
