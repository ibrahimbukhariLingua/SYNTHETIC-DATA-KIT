The diversified solution aims to offer decorrelation from traditional asset clases, capitalising on the identification and assembly of risk premia, the asset management firm says. The new vehicle is presented as a UCITS diversified fund, with management based on 20 quantitative strategies, with the objective of capturing risk premia via various asset classes – equities, bonds, credit, currencies, commodities – selected for their diversifying character. “The objective for the management team is to generate stable returns over the duration of the recommended investment period of 3-5 years, decorrelated from traditional asset classes,” says Swiss Life AM. The approach privileged by the asset management firm is to identify and assemble risk premia of various natures, related, for example, to portage, momentum, value, volatility, arbitrage of curves, all weighted according to a rigorous risk management. The approach aims for optimal structuring of the portfolio. “The management of risks for the OPCVM represents a risk of capital loss based on deep analysis and precise monitoring of the underlying strategies, a risk budget allocation, and attentive surveillance of VaR,” Swiss Life AM says. The management team remains attentive to the alignment of interests via the combination of internal strategies and strategies selected from investment banks under open architecture. “The neutrality of Swiss Life AM in the selection of investments is guaranteed by the absence of trading books,” the asset management firm says.
