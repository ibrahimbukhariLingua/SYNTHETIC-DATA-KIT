Leveraged ETFs face legal challenges


Investment News magazine has run reports, relayed in Das Investment, that the law firms Stanley Mandel & Iola and Wolf Handelstein Freeman & Herz in New York are considering a possible lawsuit against promoters of leveraged ETFs, including Proshares and Direxion. The lawyers accuse these fund management firms of offering these products to retail investors who will retain them for more than one day, though they should be reserved for professional investors and for an investment period of less than one day. These are the same criticisms that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has also made. The two law firms are planning a class action lawsuit. Proshares is already facing a lawsuit for providing insufficient warning to investors about the risks involved in its Ultra-Short Real Estate Fund, a double-reverse leveraged fund which has lost 77.2% since the beginning of the year.
