KIIDs could be improved


The provider of services to the asset management sector Kneip, and the financial communications specialist Ebsylon claim, based on a study of 100 key investor information documents (KIID) from 29 asset management firms, in four languages – English, French, German, and Italian – that the content of these documents is unsatisfactory. They add that it would be possible to introduce a number of improvements to the form and presentation of these documents, which will be required from July 2012. “What our research finds is that asset managers have made a lot of progress in the content of KIIDs, but that the form still needs some work,” says Mario Mantrisi, head of innovation and product management and a member of the executive board at Kneip. Regulations are very clear and leave little room for interpretation, the study says. The document must identify the “objectives and investment policy” if the fund invests “primarily in equities,” while in its risk/return profile the document must indicate if the fund may invest “a substantial part of its assets” in government and corporate debt. Another inconsistency is that a benchmark indicator is mentioned in the Objectives, but is not mentioned in the chart of past performance, and vice versa. Emmanuel Bégat, managing partner at Ebsylon, says that “a vast majority of KIIDs use jargon or technical terminology, even though the regulations are clear about the need to avoid this vocabulary. Lastly, the research shows clearly that the devil is in the details when it comes to creating a KIID which is 100% compliant.”
