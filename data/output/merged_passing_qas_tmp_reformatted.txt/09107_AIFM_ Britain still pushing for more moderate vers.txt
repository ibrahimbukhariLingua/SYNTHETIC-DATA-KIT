AIFM: Britain still pushing for more moderate version of directive


As finance ministers of European Union countries meet this Tuesday to find a compromise on the planned AIFM directive, the British research centre Open Europe has issued a final warning over the dangers the text in its current form poses to the asset management industry as a whole, to investors and to the European economy. According to estimates already advanced by Open Europe, the hedge fund and private equity industries contribute EUR9.2bn per year to tax revenues to the European economy. This total could theoretically be reduced if the directive were retained in its current form. In addition, Open Europe notes, the bill has not been thoroughly amended, and may result in added costs of about EUR8.2bn to investment firms. This cost would largely be passed on to investors. To avoid these eventualities, Open Europe suggests that fewer restrictions should be placed on funds and non-European managers, and that more flexible rules be laid out for depositories. Open Europe also says that it is in favour of the idea that small asset management firms and closed funds (such as investment trusts, for example) be exempted from the directive.
