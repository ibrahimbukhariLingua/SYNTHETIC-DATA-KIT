Pimco unites five personalities on a global advisory board


Pimco has retained five world-renowned experts on economic and political issues to form a Pimco Global Advisory Board. The members of the board are former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke (who will serve as chairman), former U.K Prime Minister Gordon Brown, former chief investment officer of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Ng Kok Song, former director of policy planning for the U.S. State Department Anne-Marie Slaughter and former president of the European Central Bank Jean-Claude Trichet. They will contribute their insights to the firm on global economic, political, and strategic developments and their relevance for financial markets. The board will meet several times a year at Pimco’s Newport Beach office as well as at other offices around the world. The members will also attend the firm’s annual Secular Forum in May of each year, where the asset manager’s investment professionals discuss the economic outlook and its implications for markets over the next three to five years. Together, the board members will contribute their economic, geopolitical, and market expertise and insights to the firm’s investment process.
