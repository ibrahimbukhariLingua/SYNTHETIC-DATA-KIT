70% of Italian fund assets are from retail investors


In Italy, investment fund clients are mostly retail investors. Therefore, according to a study by GtK Eurisko and prometeia, 70% of assets in funds on sale in Italy are in the hands of retail investors, compared with 45% in Germany and about 20% in France and the United Kingdom. However, insurers and pension funds represent only 18% of assets in Italian funds, while the comparable percentage in France and Germany is 30%, and as much as 80% in the United Kingdom. This low institutionalisation of assets in Italy is partly due to the weakness of the Italian asset management sector, whose assets totalled about EUR430bn at the end of 2009, according to the study, which adds that the market is highly dependent on the product offerings at banks.
