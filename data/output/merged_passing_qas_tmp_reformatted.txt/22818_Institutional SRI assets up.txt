Institutional SRI assets up


Socially responsible investment (SRI) assets from French institutional investors have increased by EUR47.6bn between 2010 and 2011, to EUR81.1bn in 2011, an increase of 41.3%, according to the most recent statistics from Novethic. This growth was driven by outsourced management, which has leapt 150% to EUR36.9bn, largely due to several mandates from insurers. Private insurance companies have become the largest institutional SRI investors in 2011. They now represent 60% of dedicated management, which now has assets totalling EUR48.8bn as of 2011 (EUR36.9bn in outsourced management and the remainder under internal management), compared with 17% in 2010, while public funds have fallen from 41% to 24%, with nearly stable assets at EUR11.8bn. The dynamism of institutional management was one of the drivers of growth on the French SRI market in 2011, which grew by 69% to EUR115.3bn. The other reason is a rise in assets held by retail investors in open-ended funds, of 89% to EUR21bn, but this was nearly entirely the effect of fund conversions. Among the notable developments in 2011, Novethic also reports that there has been an “explosion” in normative exclusionary approaches. These approaches involve barring from a portfolio any businesses and/or governments which are guilty of severe violations of international conventions, and represents 69% of SRI assets. It is also used by non-SRI actors. Novethic counted 10 French asset management firms or institutional investors in 2011 who have deployed policies of this type for all of their assets, totalling EUR1.823trn. Looking exclusively at exclusion of controversial weapons, the assets concerned get even more considerable: EUR2.142trn. Meanwhile, Novethic also notes that there has been growth of the “best-in-universe” approach, which potentially eliminates or underweights sectors, while at the same time, “best in class” approaches are on the decline.
