East Capital given green light to invest in Chinese A-class equities


East Capital, a specialist in emerging and frontier markets, has received approval by the Commission de Surveillance du Sector Financier (CSSF) in Luxembourg to invest in A-shares through the Hong Kong – Shanghai Stock Connect program. As a result, the fund manager is now able to significantly increase its allocation to Chinese domestically listed stocks in its portfolio. The East Capital (Lux) - China Fund is the first Luxembourg domiciled fund to announce it can invest as much as 100% of its portfolio in A-shares through Stock Connect, according to a press statement. The East Capital (Lux) - Emerging Asia Fund can invest up to 30% of its portfolio through the program. East Capital’s Asian operations are managed out of Stockholm and Hong Kong, with Karine Hirn, partner and co-founder of the company leading the operations since 2010 when the firm established an office in Shanghai. As the first Nordic asset manager to get a QFII license, East Capital says it has been investing more than USD 100m on the A-shares market since the end of 2013.
