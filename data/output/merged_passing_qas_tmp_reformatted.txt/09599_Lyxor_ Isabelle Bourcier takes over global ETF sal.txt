Lyxor: Isabelle Bourcier takes over global ETF sales


Following the departure of Dan Draper, who has left London to return to the United States, Isabelle Bourcier, global head of ETF products at Lyxor Asset Management (Société Générale), has told Newsmanagers that she will be temporarily taking over responsibility for global ETF sales. The position will be filled most likely by an internal promotion in a short time, as Draper must complete a gardening leave. Draper’s other part-time responsibility, UK sales, has been taken over by Claus Hein, who will combine this responsibility with his position as head of Lyxor ETF for Scandinavia and Latin America.
