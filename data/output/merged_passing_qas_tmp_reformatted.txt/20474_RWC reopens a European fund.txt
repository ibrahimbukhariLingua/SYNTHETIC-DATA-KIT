RWC reopens a European fund


RWC Partners is reopening the European Absolute Alpha fund, managed by Ajay Gambhir, Investment Week reports. The vehicle had been closed with GBP170m last year, as the firm sought to ensure that the manager would retain investment flexibility. The fund now has GBP150m in assets, and Gambhir claims that investment opportunities in Europe have increased.
