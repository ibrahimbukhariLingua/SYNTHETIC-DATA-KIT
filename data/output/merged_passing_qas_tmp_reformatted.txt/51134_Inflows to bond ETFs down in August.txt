Inflows to bond ETFs down in August


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Inflows to bond ETFs fell by nearly half in August compared with July, to EUR2.7bn, near the monthly average over one year, acording to the barometer of monthly trends for European ETFs maintained by the research teams at Lyxor Asset Management. In developed countries, the main beneficiaries of inflows were investment grade corporate bond ETFs, which took in EUR1.4bn in new assets, due to ongoing measures by the ECB, Lyxor states. Emerging market debt is continuing to attract capital (EUR833m), but at a slower pace than in July, when inflows reached a record EUR2bn in one year. The rebound for high yield bond ETFs observed in July was short-lived, as these funds saw redemptions of EUR62m in August. Inflows of capital to inflation-linked ETFs set a record for the year (EU546m). For equities, ETFs posted net subscriptions of EUR2.1bn, confirming a trend in the past two months. In developed markets, inflows were lifted to EUR339m. The good news in US economic statistics made it possible to maintain solid inflows, with EUR1.2bn, Lyxor remarks. However, in light of more unfavourable data from Europe, European ETFs saw capital outflows of EUR1.1bn. ETFs focused on emerging market equities continued to rebound, with inflows of EUR1.5bn. “Inflows were concentrated on exposures to global emerging market indices, which may suggest that investors have adopted a tactical position to an upcoming decision by the Fed on US interest rates,” Lyxor says. The dynamic of capital inflows to Smart Beta ETFs has lost momentum, as they had only EUR435m in new assets, after posting record inflows for one year in July.
