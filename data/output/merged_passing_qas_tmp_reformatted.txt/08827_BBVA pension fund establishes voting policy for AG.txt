BBVA pension fund establishes voting policy for AGMs


The BBVA and labour unions are in the process of negotiating the strategy which the bank’s pension fund (EUR2.09bn, 38,000 members) will employ at general shareholders’ meetings at businesses in which it invests, which include Santander, Iberdrola Renovables and BBVA. Expansión reports that 76% of assets are invested in bonds, and that the fund, which is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), does not permit investment in private equity, in order to avoid disadvantaging more elderly pensioners.
