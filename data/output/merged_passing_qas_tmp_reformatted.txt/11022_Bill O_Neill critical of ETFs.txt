Bill O’Neill critical of ETFs


The chief investment officer at Merrill Lynch, Bill O’Neill, claims that ETFs are increasing the volatility that investors are seeking to avoid, Investment Week reports. Rising volatility and uncertainty on the markets has led investors to ask questions about the place of ETFs in their portfolios.ETFs may bring some clients more flexibility in navigating highly volatile markets, but experience also suggests that financial sector ETFs and futures may exacerbate the already strong correlations and already high levels of volatility, O’Neill claims.Synthetic ETFs may be cheaper than physical replication ETFs, but they also present added counterparty risks that investors need to take into account.
