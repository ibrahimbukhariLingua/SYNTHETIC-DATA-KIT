Market Vectors Index Solutions launches hedge fund beta indices


Market Vectors Index Solutions has introduced the Market Vectors Hedge Fund Beta Indices, a set of four regional and two global indices of Long/Short Equity hedge funds. The regional Long/Short Equity indices cover Developed Asia, Emerging Markets, North America and Western Europe. The global indices cover Global Long/Short Equity and Global Event Long/Short Equity. Each index seeks to capture the systematic returns (beta) of hedge funds with similar investment styles that invest in the same asset classes and same geographic markets. Market Vectors Hedge Fund Beta Indices employ a patented rating and ranking system that filters out funds with low beta as compared to their hedge fund peer group, enhancing the indicesâ€™ risk-adjusted returns. Each index is constructed using transparent, liquid ETFs to produce hedge fund-style returns.
