United Kingdom - IFAs concentrate on management and advising commissions


43% of 900 British independent financial advisors (IFAs) consider it a more promising prospect to concentrate on commissions for management and for client relationship management in order to add value to their activities, rather than to rely on income from front-end fees, according to the Trailblazer survey undertaken by Skandia. The results suggest that IFAs are in the process of rethinking their fee structures, with the added impetus of adapting to Retail Distribution Implementation Programme (RDIP) regulations.Skandia states that 25% of respondents are planning to concentrate on fewer, but more upmarket clients, while 13% are planning to create value by positioning themselves on a fund platform.
