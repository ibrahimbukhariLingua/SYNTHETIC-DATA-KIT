ING IM notes strong interest in senior bank loans on the part of institutionals


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Senior bank loans are increasingly of interest to institutionals, according to a recent study by ING Investment Management of 84 pension funds, surveyed in March 2014. 42% say that institutional investors have increased their exposure to credit awarded to non-investment grade businesses. “These are private issues negotiated directly between banks and institutional investors on a private secondary market and not the stock market,” the manager says. According to ING IM, demand for this asset class is expected to increase. 40% expect institutional investors to increase their exposure in the next 12 months, while 8% feel that the exposure will fall “slightly.” When asked about the main advantages of investments in senior bank loans, 29% of pension funds cite diversification of bond portfolios, while 19% cite risk-adjusted returns. 14% mention the low risk of payment defaults. ING IM states that assets under management by senior bank loan strategies were up 46% in the past 12 months, from USD13bn to USD19bn. “The potential for this asset class in the asset management sector is enormous, since comprehension of this product by some institutional investors is still very slight. That is what one pension fund out of four said when asked what they felt was the largest challenge for senior bank loans as an asset class,” says Dan Norman, managing director and gorup head of the senior bank loans team at ING IM.
