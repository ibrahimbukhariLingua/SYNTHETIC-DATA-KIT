Prices war for ETF savings plans


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } There has been an unprecedented price war raging in the past few weeks between providers of ETF savings plans. After Comdirect and DAB Bank, Cortal Consors, the third largest major online broker, is now working on a new fee model, which is expected to result in a major price drop, according to a spokesperson cited by Handelsblatt. The war was triggered a few weeks ago by DAB Bank, which offers 66 ETFs from db x-trackers with “zero fees.” The client is charged only the spread between buy and sell and the annual account management commission. Maxblue, the online broker from Deutsche Bank, is also offering plans based on db-x-trackers, its sister company, with no front-end fees. A competing price cut at SBroker, the platform for the German savings banks, has not been ruled out.
