UAE expats may have to save for retirement


Expats working in the United Arab Emirates may have to contribute to a retirement system whose primary objective is to build a local asset management industry and to strengthen equity and bond markets, according to Financial Times Fund Management. The assets which the pensions savings would represent are estimated to total in the hundreds of billions of dollars, according to Nigel Sillitoe, chief executive of Insight Discovery. That represents a massive opportunity for international and local asset management firms.
