JPMorgan promotes an all-terrain bond fund


In response to demand from investors, particularly in France, seeking income over performance, JPMorgan Asset Managmeent is throwing a spotlight on its Income Opportunity Fund (ISIN code: LU0289470113). The product is a sub-fund of the Luxembourg Sicav JPMorgan Investment Funds, which had USD5.18bn in assets as of 9 March, with annual returns of 5.42% since launch (19 July 2007), at a time when the Eonia gained 1.71%. This is all achieved with a total volatility of 2% to 3%, less than for government bonds.At a presentation of the fund in Paris on Monday, William “Bill” Eigen, head of opportunistic bond strategies and absolute returns, who is also the manager of the Income Opportunity Fund, explained that the fund has full freedom to use a flexible and multi-sectoral strategy in bonds, and to use all registers and types of products in the asset class (CDS, high yield, emerging markets, corporate bonds, relative value), without relying on leverage, to achieve absolute returns.The portfolio includes a core of 50 positions, and Eigen, who has invested 58.2% of the fund in high yield, has retained a relatively high level of liquidity (29.9%), “simply due to the absence of sufficiently safe investment opportunities.” Anyway, the manager would like to “retain cash to be able to act when the market doesn’t have any.”
