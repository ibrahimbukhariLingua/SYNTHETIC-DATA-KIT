US pension fund seeks to block acquisition of Delphi Financial


The Pontiac General Employees Retirement System, a Michigan pension fund, has filed lawsuits against the Japanese insurer Tokio Marine for failure to respect fiduciary commitments in its acquisition of Delphi Financial, the Financial Times reports. Tokio Marine on 21 December announced its acquisition of Delphi Financial for USD2.7bn. Delphi agreed to pay holders of B-class shares an additional USD9 per share above the price paid to A-class shareholders, which it is claimed runs against the Delphi charter, which stipulates that sharesholders in the two classes should be treated equally in the event of a takeover.
