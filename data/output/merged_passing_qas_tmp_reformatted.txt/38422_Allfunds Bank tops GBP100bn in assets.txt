Allfunds Bank tops GBP100bn in assets


The European fund distribution platform Allfunds Bank has topped the symbolic threshold of GBP100bn in assets under administration, Citywire reports. This performance is partly due to the gain of a new client, the consulting and accounting firm BWCI. On the British market, Allfunds Bank has over GBP11bn in assets under administration, and 20 clients. In June 2013, Allfunds Bank had GBP82bn, or EUR100bn, in assets.
