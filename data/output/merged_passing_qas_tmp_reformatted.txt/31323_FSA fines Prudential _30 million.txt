FSA fines Prudential £30 million


The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has fined companies in the Prudential Group (Prudential) a total of GBP30m for breaching FSA Principles and UKLA Listing Principles. The fines relate to Prudential’s failure to inform the FSA at the appropriate time that it was seeking to acquire AIA, the Asian subsidiary of AIG, in early 2010. The FSA has also censured Tidjane Thiam, Prudential’s Group Chief Executive.
