AP1 pension fund reduces its exposure to equities by SEK11bn


As of 30 June, assets in the Swedish pension fund FÃ¶rsta AP Fonden (AP1) had increased to SEK221.6bn (EUR24.3bn) from SEK218.8bn as of 31 December 2010. In its half-yearly report, AP1 states that net revenue from its investments totalled SEK3.02bn in January-June, compared with SEK2.33bn in the corresponding period of last year, and SEK20.52bn in 2010 overall. AP1 reduced its exposure to equities to 53.6% as of the end of June, from 60.3% as of the end of December, which resulted in a reduction of SEK11bn in the allocation to this asset class. Most of that amount was reallocated to bonds, whose percentage of the portfolio increased to 38.2% from 32.5%. Exposure to alternative investments was increased to 8.3% from 7.8% six months earlier. The currency allocation was reduced to 23% of the total, from 24%. The pension fund also states that the proportion of its assets managed externally as of the end of June had been reduced to 41.3% from 43.7% six months earlier. Lastly, the report states that the turbulence on equity markets worldwide provoked a drop in the value of its investments. However, the impact was limited by the fact that the allocation to equities had been reduced in first half.
