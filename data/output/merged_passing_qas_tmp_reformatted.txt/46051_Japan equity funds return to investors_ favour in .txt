Japan equity funds return to investors’ favour in late April


Preliminary data based on daily and intraday numbers show Japan equity funds on track to absorb over USD1.3 billion during the week ending April 22 as the country’s benchmark Nikkei-225 index finally broke through the 20,000 point mark, according to EPFR Global. With politics casting shadows over European markets and US equities under pressure from the combination of a mixed earnings season and the prospect of higher interest rates, the depth and consistency of Japan’s reflationary policies caught the eye of investors during the third week of April. US Equity Funds, meanwhile, look set to post outflows for the ninth time in the past 10 weeks and Europe equity funds to record their smallest inflow since the second week of January. Overall the combined daily and intraday data show bond funds absorbing a net USD5.5 billion, USD4.5 billion flowing out of equity funds and money market funds taking in around USD10 billion as redemptions from funds with US mandates were more than offset by commitments to their European counterparts, says EPFR.
