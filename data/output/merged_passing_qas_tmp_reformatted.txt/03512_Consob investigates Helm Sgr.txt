Consob investigates Helm Sgr


The growth Premium fund from Helm, a small Milan-based management firm, lasted only six months from its inception to its demise, Il Sole - 24 Ore reports. The fund, launched on 28 November 2008, was frozen in January 2009, because its only subscriber demanded a redemption. The investor was Independent Global Managers, the asset management firm which invested in Madoff, and which has since been placed in legal administration. Now, Consob, the Italian market regulator, is investigating the case of Helm, Il Sole - 24 Ore reports. There are a number of questions: Why launch a fund with only one subscriber, and why place the capital in a single investment?
