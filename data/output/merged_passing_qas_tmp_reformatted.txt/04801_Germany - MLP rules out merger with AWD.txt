Germany - MLP rules out merger with AWD


Uwe Schroeder-Wildberg, chairman of the board at MLP, declared on Wednesday that putting the company under the control of an insurer is unimaginable, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. This amounts to a categorical rejection of plans at Swiss Life to merge its German affiliate AWD with MLP. The situation is complex, since Swiss Life also owns nearly 25% of MLP, whose founder and largest shareholder (30%), Manfred Lautenschl√§ger, is opposed to a merger between the two providers of financial services.
