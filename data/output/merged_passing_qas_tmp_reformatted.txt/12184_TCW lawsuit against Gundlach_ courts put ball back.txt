TCW lawsuit against Gundlach: courts put ball back in mid-field


The Superior Court of California in Los Angeles has found that Jeffrey Gundlach, who has since founded DoubleLine, misappropriated trade secrets and violated his fiduciary duty to his former employer, TCW (USD120bn, Société Générale group). However, as it could not be established that Gundlach acted maliciously to damage TCW, no damages and interest were awarded to the plaintiff, the Wall Street Journal reports.Meanwhile, the jury has awarded USD66.7m in back salary to Gundlach and to the dozens of TCW employees who left the firm to found DoubleLine. They had been seeking USD496m.A judge will subsequently determine whether Gundlach made illicit use of business secrets which may be subject to reparations, for which TCW is seeking USD89m.Both parties claimed to have won the case after the verdict was announced.
