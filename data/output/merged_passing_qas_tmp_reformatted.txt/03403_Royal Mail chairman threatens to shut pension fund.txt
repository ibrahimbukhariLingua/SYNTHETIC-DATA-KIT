Royal Mail chairman threatens to shut pension fund


Donald Brydon, chairman of the Royal Mail, has announced that if plans to partially privatise the British mail are not successful, its pension fund, which currently has 150,000 members, will have to be closed, in a move similar to what took place at Barclays, the Sunday Times reports. The government will not bail out the pension fund if its plan to partially privatise the postal service is not approved. It is seeking to sell a part of the Royal Mail’s postage activities, but there is currently only one potential buyer, the private equity investor CVC, still in the running.It is likely that at a quarterly review of the company’s books thus summer, the pension fund’s deficit will be estimated at more than GBP10bn, which would require the Royal Mail to pay an additional annual sum of GBP500m, meaning that the amount it drains from the firm’s annual profits would increase to more than GBP1bn, up from GBP800m this year.
