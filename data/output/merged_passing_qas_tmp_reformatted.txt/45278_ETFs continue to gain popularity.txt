ETFs continue to gain popularity


More than eight out of ten financial advisers (81%) use or recommend ETFs to their clients, which makes them the most popular investment vehicle strategy out of 17 options.

ETFs are continuing to gain popularity, according to the 2015 survey of financial advisers by the Journal of Financial Planning and the FPA Research and Practice Institute.The latest survey confirms the growing popularity of ETFs with investors since 2006, when only 40% of financial advisers were using or recommending ETFs. This proportion became 44% in 2008, and 79% in 2014, when mutual funds were still in the lead, with 82% in their favour.The outlooks are still excellent for ETFs, as 51% of respondents are planning to increase the use or recommendation of ETFs to their clients in the next twelve months. No other vehicle enjoys such outlooks. It has also been observed that only 23% of advisers plan to increase their use of mutual funds in the next twelve months.
