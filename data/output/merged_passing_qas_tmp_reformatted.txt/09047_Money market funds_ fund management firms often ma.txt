Money market funds: fund management firms often make more money than subscribers


The most conservative investors have lost to their habitual refuge: money market funds. Since the beginning of the year, Expansi√≥n reports, 31 of the 89 funds in this segment lost money, and the average result in the sector is a loss of 0.05%, according to data from Inverco as of the end of February. Only 21 funds made more than 0.1% in the period under review. Three out of four fund management firms makes more money in subscriptions than the fund earns for subscribers. The average management commission on money market deposits stands at 0.55%, according to VDOS Stochastics. This figure includes products from international managers, and means that arithmetically, funds returned an average of 0.09% in the first two months of the year, while performance for 68 out of 89 funds was lower than this. It is not surprising in these conditions that investors are turning their backs on these funds: net redemptions totalled EUR897.5m in January-February, equivalent to 6.67% of assets.
