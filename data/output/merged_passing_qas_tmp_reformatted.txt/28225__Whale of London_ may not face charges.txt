“Whale of London” may not face charges


The “Whale of London,” the name attributed to a trader responsible for a trading loss of USD6.2bn at JPMorgan Chase in 2012, may escape charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Les Echos reports. The French broker, Bruno Iksil, took disproportionate risks on CDS. The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal report that he is ultimately expected to avoid criminal charges. JPMorgan Chase is reportedly nearing an agreement with the US and British regulatory authorities. A transaction may be announced in autumn, and the SEC is expected to file a civil suit. The reason for this development is that the French trader, who sought to alert his supervisors of the dangers inherent in his positions on several occasions, has been cooperating with authorities. The SEC would also like JPMorgan Chase to admit to “fault” as part of any out-of-court settlement, although the heads of the bank would not personally be held responsible.
