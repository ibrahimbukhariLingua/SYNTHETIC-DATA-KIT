The man known as the “father of ETFs” signed an agreement with Warburg Pincus in 2012 to find investment opportunities in ETFs and asset management. His first deal was to acquire a majority stake in Source. Others are expected to follow. “We have capital available to carry out strategic acquisitions which make sense, but we need to be very disciplined,” says Kranefuss. The other objective for the director is to develop Source in the United States. The firm has already appliced to launch products listed in the United States this year.
