Amundi enlarges smart beta offering


Amundi is further expanding its index range with the launch of a new index fund, Amundi Index Equity Global Multi Smart Allocation Scientific Beta, now available in France, the UK and main European markets. The fund provides exposure to the Scientific Beta Developed Multi-Beta Multi-Strategy ERC strategy index, which is composed of a selection of around 2000 stocks issued by large and mid-cap companies in developed countries. It aims to provide improved risk-adjusted performance compared to a cap-weighted index. This Scientific Beta Developed Multi-Beta Multi-Strategy ERC strategy index tracks the performance of four weighted sub-indices accessed via the Edhec Risk Institute’s Scientific Beta platform. These indices blend four stock selection factors: volatility, valuation, size and momentum with five Smart Beta diversification strategies. By combining these different factors and strategies focused on stock markets in developed countries, the objective of the index is to provide a robust and transparent solution for investors over the long term. Investors who wish to implement a Multi Smart Beta strategy, therefore, now have two available solutions within Amundi’s range: this new open-ended index fund and the ETF, launched in June 2014, which celebrates its first year of trading on Euronext and has already reached an AUM of nearly EU400 million. Valerie Baudson, Global Head of ETF, Indexing and Smart Beta at Amundi, said: «Multi-factor Smart Beta strategies represent a very important area of growth. To meet increasing client demand, Amundi has therefore developed a wide range of Smart Beta solutions with the aim of remaining at the forefront of innovation. " The Amundi Index Equity Global Multi Smart Allocation Scientific Beta fund is available through different, competitively priced, share classes, designed for all types of investors, with different minimum subscription levels and ongoing charges ranging from 0.15% to 0.50%.
