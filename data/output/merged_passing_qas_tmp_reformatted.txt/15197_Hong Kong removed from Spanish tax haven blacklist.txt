Hong Kong removed from Spanish tax haven blacklist


Hong Kong, which receives large volumes of investment from Spain, on Friday signed a double taxation agreement with Spain, which allows it to be removed from the blacklist of countries which do not cooperate with the Spanish finance ministry, Cinco Días reports.The treaty signed by the Spanish finance minister, Elena Salgado, and obtained by Cinco Días, covers personal income tax, company tax, and taxation of non-residents. It stipulates that corporate profits may be taxed in only one of the two countries. Spanish legislation provides for an exemption for dividends earned abroad, which did not apply to Hong Kong when it was considered an offshore tax haven.
