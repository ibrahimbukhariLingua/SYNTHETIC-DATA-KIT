Change in management outsourcing contract for Tocqueville Value Amérique fund


Tocqueville Finance on 18 September announced at a presentation to investors that the Tocqueville Value Amérique fund is now managed by the US management boutique Anchor Capital Advisors, based in Boston. The fund dedicated to US equities was for many years managed by the US asset management firm Tocqueville Asset Management, but the performance was manifestly not up to the expectations of Tocqueville Finance. Tocqueville AM will continue to manage the Tocqueville Gold fund, whose assets total about EUR93m.Since April this year, the management of the Tocqueville Value Amérique fund, with assets totalling about EUR100m, has been taken over by a team of two managers at Anchor, Andrew P. St. Martin, and Jennifer K. DeSisto, who was in Paris yesterday. “the fund is a kind of condensation of the best ideas from our management,” says DeSisto. The US boutique, a specialist in US equities, has about USD9bn in assets under management in nine strategies. The fund is managed with a value approach, fundamental to a stock-picking strategy which is focused on building a portfolio of 50 to 75 positions (currently 66). The selection of companies is based on their financial solidity, their competitive advantages, their top standing in their sectors, and the quality of the management team. Shares which have been neglected or undervalued by the market are closely considered by managers.All cap sizes may enter into the composition of the fund. Currently, the fund has about 54% large caps and 45% small caps. According to managers, this balanced distribution between small and large caps offers some protection against the risks of trade wars which will affect large caps with international exposure more than smaller, more modest companies. In the next 15 months, the outlooks remain very positive, but an inversion of the interest rate curve could raise the risk of recession by 2020.
