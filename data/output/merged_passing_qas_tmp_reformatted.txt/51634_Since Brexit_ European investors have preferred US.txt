Since Brexit, European investors have preferred US equities and emerging markets


The British referendum of 23 June marks a significant sea change in investment flows. Between 24 June and the end of July, European investors have moved their allocation choices to US equities (+EUR1.6077bn), which plays a role as a refuge stock. These are followed by emerging markets equities (+EUR1.455bn) and Smart Beta solutions, according to Amundi. In the Smart beta segment, Minimum Volatility ETFs have been the most popular, with inflows of EUR1.1175bn in the period, putting them ahead of Dividend and Multi Factor ETFs, with inflows of EUR834.9m and EUR341m, respectively.Meanwhile, investors have reduced their exposure to Japanese and European equities, which had posted outgoing flows of -EUR1.2264bn and -EUR1.0506bn, respectively. Euro zone equities were also affected by outflows, but to a lesser extent (-EUR620.6m): investors appear to be taking a “wait and see” posture, as some indicators suggest a rebound in the second part of the year.European investors also chose to expose themselves to emerging market debt (EUR2.0122bn) in this period: emerging market equities and bonds show some of the largest inflows since 24 June, which shows that investors are planning to maintain these exposures, not only for tactical allocation, but also for strategic allocation.In terms of bonds, investors have also selected Corporate Europe and US (with +EUR852.2m and +EUR786.1m, respectively) in their investment choices, followed by long exposures to Eurozone govies (EUR506.7m), though some outflows have been posted in Mid Eurozone govies (about -EUR300m).
