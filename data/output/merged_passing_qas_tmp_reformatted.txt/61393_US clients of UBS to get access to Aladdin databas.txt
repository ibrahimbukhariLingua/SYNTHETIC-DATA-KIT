US clients of UBS to get access to Aladdin database


The UBS group and BlackRock Solutions last week announced that they have concluded a pioneering partnership to allow US clients of the wealth management firm to access the Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management (ARWM) analysis platform. UBS becomes the first US wealth management firm to use risk analysis tools for portfolio construction developed over many years by BlackRock, a statement says. Financial advisers at UBS will have a means to analyse portfolios with the same tool already in use by many institutional investors worldwide.BlackRock Solutions has adapted components of the Aladdin institutional platform to meet the needs of large wealth management firms, which will be reconfigured under the partnership to take the specific needs of UBS into account. BlackRock and UBS will collaborate closely to improve these tools, with the objective of developing activities serving private clients. The adapted version of the Aladdin platform will be deployed in summer, initially for advisers who manage discretionary mandates.“Aladdin will allow our investment professionals to better understand the risks in our client portfolios, and to improve the expertise of advisers through the deployment of this sophisticated multi-asset class analysis engine,” says Brian Hull head of UBS WMA Client Advisory Group. The partnership comes in an environment in which debate about the respective merits of active and passive management will continue to drive development of new technologies, which may change the terms of this debate, and require financial players to rethink their strategies.For UBS, the partnership with BlackRock comes as part of a larger digital strategy for the Wealth Management Americas division, which will include the development of custom digital tools to improve and develop customer service. UBS has already announced alliances and strategic partnerships with fintechs, including the robo-advising development company SigFig.
