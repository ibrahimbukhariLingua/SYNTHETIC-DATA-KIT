How some TIPS funds generate magical returns


For the month to the end of March, «SEC yields» declared by the 173 mutual funds of inflation-linked US treasury bonds (known as TIPS, for treasury inflation-protected securities) varied from -0.77% to +5.58%. Four out of the seven ETF funds specialised in TIPS earned returns of over 5%, with 6,07% for the Pimco 15+ Year US TIPS Index. Schwab and American Century have published similar results.The Wall Street Journal reports that TIPS offer no return of over 1.75%. The explanation is simple: the SEC has not set a particular formula for calculating the returns of TIPS funds, meaning that fund managers use the method that has been in place since 1988 for ordinary mutual funds, which limited returns to dividends and interest income. For TIPS, returns come not only from interest income, but also from adjustments in value when inflation increases. For a month like April, in which inflation was easily 0.5%, after annualisation, SEC yields easily come out to 6%. This effect will be even more marked in May, when inflation is expected to near 1%.Asset management firms such as Vanguard and iShares, which publish the “real yield” of their funds, are at a disadvantage, since their returns are lower, but these figures are less likely to mislead investors.
