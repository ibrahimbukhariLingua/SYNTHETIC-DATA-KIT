European MPs debate ratings agencies and transaction tax


The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament will Wednesday debate two highly controversial issues in the financial community, the tax on financial transactions and ratings agencies. Anni Podimata, the MEP in charge of the financial transaction tax legislation, will present the proposals as rather an extension of existing frameworks. For his part, Leonardo Domenici, the MEP responsible for the new legislation on ratings agencies, will call for unsolicited ratings of sovereign debt to be forbidden, and for the creation of an entity to evaluate the solvency of European Union member countries.
