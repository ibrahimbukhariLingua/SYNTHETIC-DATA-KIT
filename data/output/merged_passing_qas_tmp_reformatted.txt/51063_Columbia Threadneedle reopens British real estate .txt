Columbia Threadneedle reopens British real estate fund


The crisis for British real estate funds appears to be clearing. The asset management firm Columbia Threadneedle Investments on Monday, 12 September announced plans to reopen subscriptions to its Threadneedle UK Property Authorised Investment Fund (Threadneedle PAIF) from 26 September at noon. This decision also applies to the Threadneedle UK Property Authorised Trust. “The depository for the fund, the British affiliate of Citibank Europe, and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the British regulator, have been informed of this decision,” the asset management firm says in a statement.The fund will reopen without redemption penalties and will return to standard monthly valuations, Columbia Threadneedle states. The asset management firm estimates that the decision to reopen the fund is “in the interests of our clients.” It also indicates that it will continue to closely monitor the market conditions and the fund.The real estate fund, with GBP1.3bn in assets, was initially frozen on 6 July, in order to protect investors in a context of high market instability following the British referendum vote to leave the European Union. This vote resulted in massive withdrawals from retail real estate funds in the United Kingdom. Since July, the Columbia Threadneedle fund has completed, traded or agreed to sell 25 real estate properties for a total of GBP167m.Like Columbia Threadneedle, many asset management firms – Aviva Investors, M&G and Aberdeen Investment Management – have also decided to freeze their own real estate funds following Brexit.
