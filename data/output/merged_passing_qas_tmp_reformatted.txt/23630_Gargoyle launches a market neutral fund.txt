Gargoyle launches a market neutral fund


The alternative management firm The Gargoyle Group, specialised in equity options strategies, has launched a market neutral fund with a continuous hedging mechanism based on index options, FINalternatives reports. The fund uses a number of proprietary elements for the vehicle, which have contributed to the success of the flagship fund from Gargoyle, the Gargoyle Hedged Value Fund. The fund seeks to earn alpha from stock-picking and the addition of premiums from the sale of overvalued call options.
