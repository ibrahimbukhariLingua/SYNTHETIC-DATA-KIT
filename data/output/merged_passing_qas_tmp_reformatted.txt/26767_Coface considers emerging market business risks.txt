Coface considers emerging market business risks


Coface says it is optimistic about corporate risks in the United States, but concerned about the risks in emerging markets such as Brazil and Thailand. In its most recent evaluations of these countries, Coface placed the A3 rating for Brazil under watch with negative implications. “The slowdown in consumption is making the industries and commerce which depend on it more fragile: household electrical appliances, automotive, electronics. Rising interst rates and inflated prices for imported components and machines, due to a depreciation of the real, are aggravated by taxes and production costs which remain high. Businesses then hesitate to accelerate their investments. In this context, payment incidents at Brazilian businesses recorded by Coface remain at a high level, near their peak in 2009,” Coface explains in a statement. The A3 evaluation for Thailand has also been placed under negative watch due to household debt levels. The A2 rating for the United States, however, has been placed on positive watch, despite the budgetary paralysis. “The government shutdown may have been a surprise but it should not have a significant effect on pending activities if it does not extend into the long term. However, uncertainty related to the US public debt ceiling remain high, and the risk of a failure to raise it cannot be ruled out. In this case, private demand may be significantly affected. However, our primary scenario at this stage is that this impasse will be avoided at the last minute, so that private consumer spending and investment remain robust, despite potential budget cuts,” Coface comments.
