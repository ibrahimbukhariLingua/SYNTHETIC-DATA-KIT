Credit Suisse and Qatar Holding strengthen ties


Credit Suisse is tightening its ties with Qatar Holding, one of the largest shareholders in the second-largest Swiss banking group. The two partners are founding Adventicum Capital Management, a joint venture active in institutional management. The firm will be based in Doha, and will commence its activities in early 2013. The new firm plans to offer institutional clients investment opportunities in the Middle East, Turkey and other new markets. Adventicum Capital Management is planning to open a second location outside the region during 2013, Credit Suisse announced on 6 November. The new firm will have a license from the Qatar Financial Centre. The creation of Adventicum represents a major step in the growth of Doha as a financial centre for the region, says Ahmad Al-Sayed, head of Qatar Holding, cited in the statement. With its expertise in institutional management and its experience in emerging markets, Credit Suisse represents the ideal partner, Al-Sayed continues. Adventicum will be led by Aladdin Hangari, director of Credit Suisse Qatar, and Martin Keller, head of the Asset Management activities of Credit Suisse in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
