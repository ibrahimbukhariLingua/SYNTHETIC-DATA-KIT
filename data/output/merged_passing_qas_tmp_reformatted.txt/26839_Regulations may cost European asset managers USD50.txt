Regulations may cost European asset managers USD500m p.a.


The asset management sector in Europe may be facing total costs of EUR300m to EUR500m, or EUR220m to EUR360m per year, in the next three years, to meet new regulatory requirements, according to a study by BNY Mellon, in association with Ernst & Young.These additional costs will in the next three to five years result in a “conservative” increase of 3% in operating costs and a 2% increase in total expense ratio (TER), on the basis of a stabilisation of profits at their current levels.The study, entitled “The Impending Profitability Challenge for European fund Managers,” emphasizes the growing pressure on asset management firms which are facing rising costs of compliance and investors who are demanding ever less costly products.
