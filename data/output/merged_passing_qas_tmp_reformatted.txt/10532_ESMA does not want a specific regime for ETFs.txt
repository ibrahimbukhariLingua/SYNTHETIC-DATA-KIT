ESMA does not want a specific regime for ETFs


The European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) is planning to introduce certain rules which are specific to ETFs, but there is no talk of creating an ETF-specific regime, the chairman of ESMA, Steven Maijoor, announced on 29 November at the Investment Management Forum of the European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA).“The approach that ESMA intends to follow is to identify clearly those provisions which are relevant to all UCITS funds, with only some rules being specific to ETFs and reflecting their characteristics (for example, the aforementioned issues relating to the secondary market trading),” says Maijoor. For issues arising from securities lending activities, for instance, the approach that the regulator intends to follow is to cover all kinds of UCITS – ETFs and non-ETFs – engaging in such activity.Regarding the PRIPs initiatives, the range of products to be covered is quite broad and potentially includes collective investment undertakings, structured products, insurance-based investments and derivatives. Maijoor adds that for selling practices in particular, he is aware of the fact that a horizontal legislative approach may raise some issues in relation to the areas of competence of securities and insurance regulators in those EU Member States where they are not integrated and that the Commission already presented a proposal for the review of the MiFID rules. «Should the Commission decide not to adopt a horizontal legislative approach for the harmonisation of both disclosure rules and selling practices for PRIPs, I strongly hope that at least, in order to ensure the necessary consistency, the revised Insurance Mediation Directive (IMD) will provide that the MiFID II rules on selling practices apply to those PRIPs which are within the scope of the IMD», he says.
