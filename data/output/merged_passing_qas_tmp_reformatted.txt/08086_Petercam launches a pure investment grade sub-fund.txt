Petercam launches a pure investment grade sub-fund


The Belgian asset management firm Petercam will on 21 June launch the Petercam Bonds EUR Investment Grade, a sub-fund which will invest in Euro zone government bonds, to meet the requirements of clients and the limited prospects for exclusively investment grade investments. The new product will be an alternative to the Petercam Bond EUR, which will continue to invest in Euro zone issuers, regardless of their rating. The launch of the sub-fund comes following the degradation of the ratings of some Euro zone countries by several ratings agencies. After Greece was downgraded to junk bond status by S&P, and then by Moody’s, the management team at Petercam found itself facing a dilemma, between a desire to invest in countries with investment grade ratings, and the possibility of adopting a neutral position with relation to the benchmark index, the JPM EMU All Maturities, which has maintained Greece in the portfolio. “The rules of JPM do not stipulate and minimal rating condition, but define the investment universe in relation to liquidity criteria. Therefore, Greece has no reason to be leaving the index in the near future,” says Petercam. “Therefore, it was decided that the Petercam Bonds EUR Sicav will maintain its referent as the JPM EMU All Maturities, and will not invest in Euro zone government bonds denominated in Euros, regardless of the rating of issuing countries. The prospectus for the sub-fund has been modified to reflect this,” the Belgian management firm continues. The Petercam Bonds EUR Investment Grade will be invested in government and assimilated bonds denominated in Euros, whose issuers must be rated at least BBB- by Standard & Poor’s, Baa3 by Moody’s, and BBB- by Fitch.
