Sparinvest restructures Paris office


The Danish asset management firm Sparinvest has announced a restructuring of its Paris office. While the office had previously been composed of one assistant, two sales staff and Benoît Schouler, CEO of Sparinvest France, Schouler will now singlehandedly provide oversight of all client portfolios. “That does not mean the Paris office will be closed” says Schouler. But four years after the beginning of the financial crisis, Sparinvest needs to adapt its commercial structure, the CEO says. Although outflows have been “relatively limited” since the beginning of the year, the head of the French office says, he did not wish to specify the precise amount of assets under management by the structure. Because management is located in Denmark, it will not be affected by the restructuring, and will continue to function as previously. Some duties of the Paris office, such as administrative oversight and sending of reports will be moved to Luxembourg, which has a French-speaking client services unit. Schouler will work in close collaboration with Luxembourg, where funds on sale in France are domiciled. France is not the only victim of the difficult environment. The Frankfurt office in Germany has also been restructured. The former head of that office, Jörg-Volker Grüneke, has left his job, and Christina Coustry, already in charge of international coordination at the group, will now handle the German market with her team from Luxembourg. Earlier this year, the Danish asset management firm Sparinvest announced that it is transferring the domicile of its parent company, Sparinvest Holdings SE, from Denmark to Luxembourg (see Newsmanagers of 4 January, 2012).
