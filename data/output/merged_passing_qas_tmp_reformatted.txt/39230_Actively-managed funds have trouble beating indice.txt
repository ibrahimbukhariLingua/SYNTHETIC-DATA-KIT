Actively-managed funds have trouble beating indices


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } At a time when equity markets last year generally posted double-digit growth, the performance of actively-managed funds has been rather mitigated in the same period, according to the most recent comparative table published by the index provider S&P Dow Jones Indices Versus Active Funds (SPIVAÂ®) Scorecard. In the twelve months to the end of 2013, 55.8% of large cap managers, 38.97% of midcap managers, and 68.09% of small cap managers underperformed the indices. The majority of equity managers and all domestic equity categories were unable to earn higher returns than their respective benchmark indices over three and five-year periods. Growth managers, however, did better than experts in the value approach. With the exception of small caps, most growth managers active in the large, mid and multi-caps categories posted higher performances than the indices. In terms of international equities, the majority of international developmed market and international small cap categories posted higher returns than their respective benchmarks. However, 54.09% fo global equity managers and 57.48% of emerging market equity managers failed to beat the indices. Independently of the investment horizon, international small caps are the only category which has posted constant outperformance when actively-managed.
