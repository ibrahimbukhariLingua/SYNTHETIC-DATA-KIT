Yomoni tops EUR100m in assets


Three years after its launch, Yomoni has topped EUR100m in assets, and 10,000 clients, Sébastien d’Ornano, executive chairman, has announced at a press conference. This is double the level at the end of 2017, when the 100% online firm had EUR40m in assets and 6,000 clients. The director has announced that he is satisfied with the annual performance over three years of the index-based mandates offered by Yomoni, which range from 2.1% to 8.4%. He feels that “index-based mandates are worthy successors to wealth funds, which have had their time to shine.”To help this development, and in the hopes of achieving a target which has been set of EUR1bn in assets by 2020, Yomoni yesterday launched its parallel employee savings range. The offerings are digital, and have been designed especially for SMEs and mid-sized businesses, with two objectives: to “simplify procedures for directors and to approve assistance to employees,” says d’Ornano.For companies, Yomoni has set up a 100% online assistance programme, which makes it possible to set up employee savings “in less than 10 minutes,” says d’Ornano. For employees, the firm offers a robo-advisor, with index-based management which has represented the core of its offerings for three years, with wealth management experts.Yomoni has created an inter-business employee savings plan adapted to the situation for SMEs and mid-sized busniesses, which completely cancels front-end fees for its product range. For companies, the firm has chosen an “all-in-one” corporate pricing of EUR30 per employee, for smaller companies, and EUR20 per employee for larger ones. Yomoni has also teamed up with Arkéa Investment Services, an affiliate of the Arkéa group, one of its sharehiolders, which will retain the assets of employees.To launch the new product range, Yomoni has also called on shareholders financially, and raised EUR4m before summer. In addition to Crédit Mutuel Arkéa, the firm counts Christian Gueugnier and Didier Le Menestrel, the co-founders of La Financière de l’Echiquier, among the shareholders in the holding company.
