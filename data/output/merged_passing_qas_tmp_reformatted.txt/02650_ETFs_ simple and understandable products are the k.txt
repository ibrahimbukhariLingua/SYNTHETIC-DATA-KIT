ETFs: simple and understandable products are the key


In the area of ETFs, Jean-Frédéric Nussbaumer, head of equities trading execution at HSBC Private Bank, recommends sticking with simple and understandable products, Le Temps reports. “[T]he concept of an ETF, which works well for major indexes such as the NASDAQ or the S&P 500 in the United States or the SMI in Switzerland, does not perform as well for more exotic indexes. The costs can vary from one to four times their ordinary levels, depending on the categories,” the Swiss newspaper notes. Christophe Aletti, head of structured products at UBP in Geneva, estimates that many users are not aware of the complexity of the structures behind some products. “Information is not as clear and transparent as it should be,” he claims in Le Temps.
