Funds of «German Madoff» were never genuinely audited


According to a Capital investigation undertaken by Financial Times Deutschland, Helmut Kiener - the accused fraudster known as the “German Madoff” - falsified the performance of his funds, and for years avoided any real auditing of his books. Journalists found no trace of attention to the books by any chartered accountant. The relevation raises serious questions about the rigour of controls undertaken by the German financial market supervisory authority, BaFin. It also reveals that in the British Virgin Islands, the K1 Global fund was registered only as a “private fund,” while the K1 Invest fund was not declared at all. Meanwhile, the Financial Service Commission (FSC) in Tortola, on the Virgin Islands, has revealed that the tax advisor Josef Augustin Becker de Frankenthal of Palatinat, whom Kiener declared as his chartered accountant, is not licensed as an auditor by the FSC.
