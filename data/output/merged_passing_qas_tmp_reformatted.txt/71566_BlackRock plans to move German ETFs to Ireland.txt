BlackRock plans to move German ETFs to Ireland


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } The US giant BlackRock is planning to transfer its ETFs with the iShares brand sold in Germany to Ireland, the specialist website Fondsprofessionell reports. In total, 54 German-registered tracker funds, which represented assets as of the end of 2017 of EUR46.1bn. Tax reforms in Germany which have inspired this project came into effect at the start of this year, and apply the same tax rate to German and foreign funds. In this setting, it is necessary to have two ETF platforms in Europe to achieve more advantageous taxation, as this is no longer in Germany. The concentration of ETFs at a single firm has allowed for economies of scale, which are attractive to everyone. The Irish iShares platform is more than five times larger than the German platform. ETFs on sale in Ireland now generally have the same or lower total expense ratios (TER) than those available in Germany, BlackRock says, adding that investors need to be able to benefit from larger funds, which generally offer better liquidity and tighter margins. The timetable for the transfer has not been set, and will depend on approval from the supervisory authorities, but the days are numbered for the German firm which had housed the ETFs â€“ although the ETFs will continue to be managed in Munich, and this is not expected to be affcted by the decision to move the funds to Ireland.
