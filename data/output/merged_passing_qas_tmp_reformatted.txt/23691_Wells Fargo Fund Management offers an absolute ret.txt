Wells Fargo Fund Management offers an absolute return strategy


The investment advising firm Wells Fargo Funds Management, which advises the Wells Fargo Advantage Funds, has launched the Wells Fargo Advantage Absolute Return Fund, which will invest most of its assets in a master fund managed by the institutional investment specialist GMO. The fund gives access for the first time to the absolute return strategy from GMO. The fund aims for returns higher than inflation over the duration of a market cycle, regardless of market conditions. The fund is highly flexible, and has no constraints as to asset class or exposure (markets, sectors, countries, cap sizes.) It uses a very wide range of strategies, including inflation-linked bonds, emerging market debt, currencies, options, spread trading, natural resources, commodities, real estate and long/short.
