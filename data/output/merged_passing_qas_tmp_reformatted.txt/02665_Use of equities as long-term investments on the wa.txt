Use of equities as long-term investments on the wane


The Belgian newspaper L’Echo, citing De Tijd, reports that long-term investors are increasingly being replaced by investors seeking quick returns on stock markets. For example, on the Brussels stock exchange, investors hold the top shares for about 1.5 to 3 years. Twenty years ago, Belgian shares remained in portfolios for an average of 5 years. This trend can also be observed in other countries. In the United States, according to a study by Société Générale, shares in the New York Stock Exchange remain in the portfolio of investors for an average of 9 months, compared with an average of 10 years in the 1940s.
