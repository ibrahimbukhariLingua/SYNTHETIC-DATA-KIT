Regulators launch a consultation on shadow banking


The Financial Stability Board (FSB) on 18 November published a series of recommendations which will be subject to consultation, which aim to strengthen surveillance and regulation of shadow banking activities. Regulators concentrated on five major areas: interactions of banks with the shadow banking system, money market funds, other entities which have banking activities in unregulated environments, securitisation, securities lending, and pensions. All of these subjects are treated in multiple consultation documents, while a general presenttation lays out the philosophy of the FSB in relation to shadow banking, as well as recommendations overall, while a specific report deals with all entities other than money market funds, and another deal with securities lending and pensions. All of these texts are subject to consultation until 14 January 2013, and the Basel Committee may propose recommendations on the interaction of banks with the shadow banking system until mid-2013. The International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) has already produced recommendations for money market funds and securitisations just before the weekend (see elsewhere in Newsmanagers). The FSB, which will continue to monitor the efforts of the various working groups, is planning to publish its final recommendations in September 2013.
