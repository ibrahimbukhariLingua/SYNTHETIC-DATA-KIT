La Française takes total control of Inflection Point Capital Management


The La Française group is preparing to take complete control of Inflection Point Capital Management UK (IPCM), its London-based joint venture, led by the sustainable development specialist Matthew Kiernan. The two parties formed the partnership in late 2013 to accelerate development of sustainable development research, advising services, and associated products. “This change in control of capital will come with a recreation of the brand,” the French asset management firm says. The details of the transaction have not been revealed. As part of the operation, Kiernan will be leaving his position as chief executive officer (CEO) at the end of June.“ The acquisition of IPCM reflects a desire on the part of La Française, as a top calibre European asset manager, to strengthen its innovation capacity in socially responsible investment (SRI), La Française adds. IPCM has successfully deployed its investment strategy, Stratégie Avancée d’Investissement (SAI), on all of its equity portfolios and some fixed-income products from La Française. The SAI approach irrigates the entire socially responsible investment strategy for the group.” Concretely, the approach unites analysis of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria with strategic measurements of capacity for adaptation and innovation, crossed with financial analysis and thematic research.@page {margin: 0.79in; }P {LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.1in}
