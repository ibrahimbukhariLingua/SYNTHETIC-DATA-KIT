Three former HDF heads move to Theam


According to information received by Newsmanagers, the three employees who left the French multi-management firm HDF Finance earlier this year (see Newsmangers of 7 February 2011) have joined Theam, the structure created from a merger of Harewood Asset Managmeent and the Sigma team from BNP Paribas Asset Management, and which is now a wholly-owned unit of BNP Paribas Investment Partners (see Newsmanagers of 16 March 2011). Eric Debonnet, the former head of research and risk management at HDF Finance, becomes head of alternative management at Theam. David Gilleron, who was co-CIO for equities at the French boutique, has been appointed co-CIO alternative multi-management at the BNP Paribas IP unit. Thierry de Rycke, previously co-CIO for fixed income, currencies and relative value at HDF Finance, has also joined Theam. The three HDF veterans rejoin Gilles Guérin, CEO of Theam, who spent a few months at HDF as CEO and vice-chairman of the board. Theam’s activities are structured around four specialties, including alternative management, which represents EUR5.4bn in assets, according to figures from March 2011. The other areas are guaranteed and protected funds (EUR25.1bn), ETF and index-based management (EUR15.9bn), and systematic active management (EUR2.4bn).
