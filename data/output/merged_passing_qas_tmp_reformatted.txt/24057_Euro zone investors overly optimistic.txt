Euro zone investors overly optimistic


Mathieu Pivovard, head of diversified management at Allianz Global Investors France, says in an interview with Agefi that markets and investors have become too optimistic, and that the economic momentum can only fall in the euro zone (and the United States). Results will continue to be revised downward, and the situation in Greece (and maybe also Portugal) may degenerate. In this environment, “exposure to high-risk assets has been reduced and a correction is expected, which if conditions permit it, will be an occasion to take on risk again.”
