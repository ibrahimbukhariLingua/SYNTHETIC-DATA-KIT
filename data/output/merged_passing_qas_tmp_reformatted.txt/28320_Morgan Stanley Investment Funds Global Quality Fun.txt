Morgan Stanley Investment Funds Global Quality Fund launched


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM) has announced the launch of the Morgan Stanley Investment Funds (MS INVF) Global Quality Fund. The portfolio of the fund is invested in companies which are deemed to be “of high quality, characterised by their ability to generate revenue, with a solid competitive advantage, an experienced management team and strong intangible asset, for example, brands and retail chains,” a statement says. To construct the portfolio of assets and determine their quality, a team of portfolio managers analyses firms on the basis of certain criteria, including resistance of earnings, attractiveness of profit margins and sustainability of returns over the complete economic cycle. The team will then meet with the management of the firm in order to understand its culture and its long-term strategy. The process provides a means to evaluate the sustainability of the performance of the business. The last measurement tool is the valuation level,which must be attractive in order to justify an investment.
