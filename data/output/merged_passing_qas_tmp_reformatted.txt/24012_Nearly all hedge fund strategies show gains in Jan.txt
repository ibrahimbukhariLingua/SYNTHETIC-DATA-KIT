Nearly all hedge fund strategies show gains in January


The hedge fund indices calculated by the Edhec-Risk Institute have nearly all finished the month of January in positive territory, with the notable but not altogether surprising exception of the short-selling strategy, which has lost 6.85% for the month. The emerging markets strategy shows the best returns for January, with gains of 4.55%, where it had finished last year with losses of 10.8%. Other winning strategies for the month include long/short equity (3.36%), distressed securities (3.28%), event-driven (2.95%), convertibles arbitrage (2.22%), and bond arbitrage (1.33%). After an annus horribilis last year, funds of funds have started the year on a positive note, with gains of 1.65%.
