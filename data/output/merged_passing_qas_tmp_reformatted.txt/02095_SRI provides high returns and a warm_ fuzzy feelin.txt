SRI provides high returns and a warm, fuzzy feeling


After noting that ecological sectoral funds in Germany currently represent assets of EUR826m, or about one third of the amount in biotech and pharmaceuticals funds, BÃ¶rsen-Zeitung points out that regardless of the method used to compose funds (exclusion or best-in-class) SRI generates outperformance. According to a study by the Swiss asset management firm SAM (Robeco group) covering 2,500 businesses in all sectors, 20% of the most sustainable development-friendly businesses in 2008 posted performance 300 basis points higher than the 20% least sustainable development-friendly. Lucrative investments can also provide a good conscience, it seems, as long as the right fund is selected. According to the Sustainable Business Institute (SBI), the best sustainable development equities funds in the German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) in first half 2009 posted returns of about 53%, while the worst of them lost 7%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Sustainability World index gained about 28%.
