“From the beginning, we had to slow down the subscriptions, especially with regard to investors who were too tactical” -


NewsManagers: Cobas Asset Management has been operating since February/March 2017. What early conclusions do you draw from these first months? Veronica Vieira: We obtained approval from the CNMV, the Spanish financial regulator, in February. The founder of the asset management firm, Francisco Garcia Paramès, with his immediately constructed team, began investing in equity funds in early January 2017. So we have been active for about 10 months. NewsManagers: How has your activity evolved? Veronica Vieira: In the first few months, we had inflows of a few hundreds of millions of euros, thanks to mandates from institutional and retail investors who know the management style of our team well. We had about EUR1bn by the end of first half, and we have just topped EUR2bn. The recognised expertise of Mr. Garcia Paramès in value management explains most of this growth. In the past 25 years, he has returned about 15% per year with an approach which has virtually not varied at all! NewsManagers: How are your assets distributed? Veronica Vieira: We need to note that over the past few years, and even the past few decades, we have been doing value, equity, long only, mostly in the small and midcaps sector. We have an Iberia fund, an international ex Spain and Portugal fund, and then we have our flagship fund, Cobas Selección (or Cobas Selection Fund in Luxembourg), which includes the Iberian countries and international more generaly. The assets in this last strategy total over EUR1bn. The strategy of the international fund has assets of about EUR350m. Mandates represent about EUR550m.....
