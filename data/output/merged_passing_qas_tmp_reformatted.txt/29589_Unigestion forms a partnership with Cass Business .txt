Unigestion forms a partnership with Cass Business School


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The Swiss firm Unigestion on 7 June announced its collaboration with the Centre for Asset Management Research (CAMR) at Cass Business School, a London-based establishment that ranks among the best producers of university financial research in Europe. As part of the collaboration, Unigestion displays its desire to explore and deepen its research programme and to produce new cutting-edge techniques in asset management. Via the research partnership, Unigestion will sponsor the annual CAMR conference in London; to be held in early December 2013, as well as a series of work seminars. Institutional investors, consultants and advisers from the industry will be invited to attend and participate in meetings to facilitate three-way dialogue and to discuss questions of application directly with asset managers and academics. Unigestion will also admit several Cass students for internships, in order to allow them to conduct more extensive research on topics that may be immediately applied as part of the investment process at the firm. Unigestion and Cass are assured that their collaboration will help to generate innovative new ideas in research and to encourage fruitful exchanges between the academic world and the world of asset management, in the interests of institutional investors. The first conference, on the subject of asset allocation between various segments of private equity, was held on Wednesday, 1 May at Cass Business School. The debate was introduced by Hanspeter Bader, head of private equity at Unigestion, and hosted by Edgar Miller, associate professor of private equity at Cass. The second conference will be held in September 2013.
