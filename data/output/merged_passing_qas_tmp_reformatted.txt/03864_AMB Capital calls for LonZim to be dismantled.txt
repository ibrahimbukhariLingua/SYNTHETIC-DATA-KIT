AMB Capital calls for LonZim to be dismantled


South African alternative asset manager AMB Capital and Damille Partners IV, which own 27% of capital in LonZim (in which Lonrho holds 24.25%), will move at an extraordinary general shareholders’ meeting to dismiss the four executive directors of the company and sell its assets in Zimbabwe, the Sunday Times reports. LonZim has been listed on the AIM in London since 2007, and Lonrho, the founder, has operational control. LonZim’s assets include Celsys (mobile telephony, printing); Paynet (online payment systems), and Millpal (chemistry). The chairman, David Lenigas, has called on shareholders to reject the demands of AMB and Damille.
