NBIM calls for more transparency over “water” risks


On the occasion of the publication of the Water Discolure Global Report 2011 by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) has announced that it will be calling on companies whose shares feature in its portfolio to issue more appropriate communications on the subject of their exposure to “water” risk, and the measures they are taking to manage this risk in their operations and supply chain. NBIM, an affiliate of the Bank of Norway in charge of managing the Government Pension Fund – Global (GPFG), formerly known as the Oil Fund (DKK3.157trn), says that a survey undertaken this year of over 400 companies in its portfolio found that the companies that provide adequate information on water risks were far too few and far between, particularly companies which provide information about their supply chain. The asset management firm claims that although climate change issues are a global phenomenon which requires international action and regulations, water is a resource whose management is optimal on the local scale. The CDP report shows that shortages of water can have a negative influence on the activity and profitability of businesses, but that efforts to manage risks related to water remain far behind measures that aim to bring the effects of climate change under control.
