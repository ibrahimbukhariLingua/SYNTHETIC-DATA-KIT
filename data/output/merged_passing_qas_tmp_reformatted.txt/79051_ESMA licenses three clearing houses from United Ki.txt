ESMA licenses three clearing houses from United Kingdom


The European Securities Markets Authority, ESMA, on Monday, 18 February announced that it has granted EMIR recognition to three British clearing houses, which will come into effect in the case of a no-deal Brexit. In that case, recognition would kick in the day after exit from the United Kingdom, for a period of one year. The three clearing-houses to be licensed in case of no deal are LCH Limited, LME Clear Limited and ICE Clear Europe. In a statement, ESMA explains that it has taken the decision with the objective of avoiding negative impact on the financial stability of the European Union. “ESMA had previously announced that its council of supervisors would also support access for British central depositories (UK CSD). The process of recognition is still in progress and the results will be published as soon as discussions conclude,” the European authority explains.
