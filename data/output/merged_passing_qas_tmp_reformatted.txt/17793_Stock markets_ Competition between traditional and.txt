Stock markets: Competition between traditional and alternative platforms drives up quality


The markets are more attractive for investors when there is strong competition between traditional and alternative platforms, according to a study recently published by the CFA Institute.The study, “Dark Pools, Internalization, and Equity Market Quality,” evaluates the impact of dark trades, which take place often in dark pools and internationalization of brokers, on measures related to the quality of the market such as bid/offer spreads and the depth of the market. The study finds that although originally an increase in dark trading is synonymous with an improvement in the quality of the markets, they deteriorate when a majority of trades are conducted opaquely.The CFA Institute study proposes that regulatory measures be put in place to encourage healthy competition and protect investors who make trades on traditional markets. These recommendations include the following points: Internalisation of orders placed by retail investors should be required. It brings a real improvement in prices, which means significant savings for small shareholders, and protection for those who make their trades on traditional markets. Regulators should monitor and measure transactions in dark pools and take necessary measures if they increase excessively; Alternative platforms should voluntarily allow investors and regulators to take clearer decisions about their use.
