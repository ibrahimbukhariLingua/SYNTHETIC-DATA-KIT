BlackRock calls for tougher regulation of ETFs


Joe Linhares, CEO of BlackRock for Europe, on Friday called for European regulations to make a stricter separation between ETF promoters who use derivatives (synthetics) and the providers of these derivatives (swaps), which ESMA did not do in its proposals in late January, Handelsblatt reports. Linhares also claims that the names of ETFs should make it possible to easily determine whether the ETF uses synthetic or physical replication. Linhares is also critical of proposals by ESMA which would impose the same securities lending standards for counterparties and swaps, even though the portfolio and collateral do not have the same objective: in the former case, the aim is to avoid letting the portfolio get too concentrated, while collateral aims to minimise counterparty risks. Lastly, the BlackRock head affirms that it is necessary to label particularly complex ETFs, which is not the case for all products of that type, which use swaps. However, inverse leveraged funds clearly need to be identified as high risk.
