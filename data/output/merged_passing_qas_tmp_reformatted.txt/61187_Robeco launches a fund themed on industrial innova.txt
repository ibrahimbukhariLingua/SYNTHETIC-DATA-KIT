Robeco launches a fund themed on industrial innovations


Robeco has added to its themed funds. The Netherlands-based asset management firm on 24 May announced the launch of the Robeco Global Industrial Innovation Equities fund, which will aim to invest in “four major growth trends” in industry, including robotics, digital manufacturing, the energy transition and cyber-security. The fund is domiciled in Luxembourg, and is managed by Marco van Lent, portfolio manager and member of the “Trends Investing” (themed investment) team at Robeco. The benchmark index for the fund is the MSCI World All Countries index, but “this index is not used in the selection process” for stocks, Robeco says in a statement. The businesses are selected on the basis of their exposure to four identified trends, fundamental analysis, and an integrated sustainability and risk analysis. The fund will be based in a concentrated portfolio of about 40 to 60 stocks. The Robeco team responsible for themed funds currently has about EUR2.8bn in assets under management as of the end of April 2017. The range includes the funds Robeco Global Consumer Trends Equities, Robeco New World Financial Equities, Robeco Property Equities, Robeco Global Growth Trends Equities, and lastly, Rolinco. The new fund is aimed both at retail investors and at wholesale distributors. It will be released for sale in the key markets in which Robeco registers it.
