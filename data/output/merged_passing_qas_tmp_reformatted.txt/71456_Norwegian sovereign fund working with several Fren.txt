Norwegian sovereign fund working with several French asset management firms


The Norwegian sovereign fund on 28 February released a report which states the precise list of external stock market operators who are responsible for specific equity allocations on behalf of the fund. These generally include mandates for managers who have specific expertise in well-defined investment sectors, the fund says. Assets allocated to these external managers as of the end of 2017 represented about NOK451bn, or about EUR46.8bn. Among the firms selected are some French asset management firms, including Financière Arbevel, Inocap Gestion, Lazard Asset Management and Pioneer Investment Management, which is now part of Amundi.The big players in asset management have a strong presence on the list, including BlackRock, BNY Mellon Investment Management, Schroder Investment Management, and Templeton Asset Management. But funds are clearly selected on the basis of the expertise offered, as the arrival of the external management pool from the Spanish asset management firm Cobas Asset Management shows. The Spanish specialist website elconfidencial says that the value style asset management firm of Francisco Garcia Paramés has not accepted all of the allocation offered to it, in the interests of perserving its specific investment approach, so as to be able to implement a “true and tough” value management.
