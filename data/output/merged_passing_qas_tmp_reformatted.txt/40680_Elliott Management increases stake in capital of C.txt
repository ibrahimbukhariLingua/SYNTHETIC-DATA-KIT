Elliott Management increases stake in capital of Celesio


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The activist investor Elliott Management Corp has increased its stake in the German medical retailer Celesio, in which it now holds the equivalent of 24.08% of voting rights, compared with less than 20% previously, according to documents subitted to the Frankfurt stock exchange, the news agency Reuters reports. Elliott has increased its stake in the German business following the failure of a bid by McKesson for Celesio. Elliott also states in its documents submitted to the stock market that it holds convertible bonds representing an additional 7.93% of voting rights. In other words, Elliott has a theoretical total of 32.01% voting rights. As the convertibles have not yet matured, Elliott is not immediately required to submit a buyout offer, which is required under German lay whenever a stake exceeds 30%.
