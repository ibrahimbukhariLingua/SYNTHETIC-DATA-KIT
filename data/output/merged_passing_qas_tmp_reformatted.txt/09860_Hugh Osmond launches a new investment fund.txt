Hugh Osmond launches a new investment fund


This week, the Sunday Times reports, the financier Hugh Osmond will announce plans to launch a GBP500m investment vehicle entitled Horizon on the London Stock Exchange, and to use it as a launchpad for a takeover bid for a business or businesses valued at potentially as much as GBP500m. Osmond plans to buy large companies which have been bought up by private equity investors, and whose business continues to perform poorly. An ideal project would be to restructure Gala Coral, which is a fundamentally healthy business, but which has been dragged down by excessive debt.
