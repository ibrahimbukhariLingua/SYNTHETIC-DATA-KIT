David Einhorn fined for market abuse


The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has decided to fine David Einhorn, owner of the US hedge fund Greenlight Capital Inc, and his fund GBP7.2 million for engaging in market abuse in relation to an anticipated significant equity fundraising by Punch Taverns Plc in June 2009."The FSA accepted that Einhorn’s trading was not deliberate because he did not believe that it was inside information. However, this was not a reasonable belief. Investment professionals are expected to handle inside information carefully regardless of whether they have been formally wall-crossed. This was a serious case of market abuse by Einhorn and fell below the standards the FSA expects, particularly due to Einhorn’s prominent position as President of Greenlight and given his experience in the market», comments the UK regulator.
