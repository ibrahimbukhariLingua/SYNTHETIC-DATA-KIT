Investors defiant over Greek risk


With a leaderless Greece seemingly circling the drain leading to exit from the Eurozone, investors spent the second week of May looking for asset classes and countries that offer some degree of protection if the currency union begins to unravel, according to EPFR. EPFR Global-tracked Japan Equity Funds and Germany Equity Funds both attracted over USD750 million during the week ending May 16, and US Bond Funds absorbed over $4 billion for the fifth week in a row. Financial Sector Funds also found themselves under fire as the risks of a disorderly Greek default mounted. Redemptions from this fund group hit levels last seen in early 4Q08.US Equity Funds unexpectedly saw fresh money from retail investors for the first time since early July 2011.Overall, EPFR Global-tracked Equity Funds posted outflows of USD5.12 billion while Bond Funds took in a net USD6.64 billion. Money Market Funds saw USD6.57 billion pulled out with European Money Market Funds seeing a five week inflow streak come to an end.
