Columbia launches a risk allocation fund


The US firm Columbia Management (USD344bn in assets), like the British firm Threadneedle an affiliate of Ameriprise Financial, has announced the launch of the open-ended Columbia Risk Allocation Fund (acronym: CRAAX for A-class shares), which functions on the basis of an equally-weighted exposure to risk in various asset classes (equities, bonds, and inflation-hedging instruments).The objective is to avoid a concentration of risk in a single category of supports, while generating attractive performance over the long term, with lower risk than for a traditional diversified fund.The fund is managed by Todd White, with the assistance of Anwiti Bahugna, Fred Copper, Kent Peterson and Beth Vanney as co-managers.Maximum front-end fee is 5.75%, and management commission is 1% for A-class shares.
