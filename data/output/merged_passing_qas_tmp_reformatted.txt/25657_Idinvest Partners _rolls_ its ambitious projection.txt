Idinvest Partners “rolls” its ambitious projections


In one year, assets at Idinvest Partners have risen from EUR3.3bn to EUR4bn, achieving the market plan announced at the end of 2012 (see Newsmanagers of 12 December 2012). On Tuesday, Christophe Bavière, chairman of the managing board, and Benoist Grossmann, managing partner, reaffirmed their objective of doubling assets under management in five years, but from this new base of EUR4bn. These assets are distributed with EUR2.9bn for financing of European companies (funds of funds, secondary transactions, owners’ equity, senior or mezzanine debt), and EUR1.1bn in financing for young and innovative companies (with the largest Parisian venture fund, focused on information technologies, cleantech and health).The press conference was an occasion for Idinvest Partners to announce that it had raised EUR65m, with Idinvest Private Value Europe, the first fiscal FCPR dedicated to lending to non-public SMEs, which was closed in September, and that it is launching a successor fund, Idinvest Private Value Europe II, whose inflow objectives are about EUR80-90m. The subscription period is open in principle until January 2015.
