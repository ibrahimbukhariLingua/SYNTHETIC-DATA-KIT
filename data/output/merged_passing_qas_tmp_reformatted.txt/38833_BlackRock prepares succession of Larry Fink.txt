BlackRock prepares succession of Larry Fink


The board of directors at BlackRock is preparing a reshuffle which would be the first step in a long-term succession plan for Larry Fink, the founder and CEO of the group, the Financial Times reports today. Fink has been been working to hand off more responsibility to a younger generation of directors below the three top men, being himself, Rob Kapito, chairman, and Charlie Hallac, COO. Rob Goldstein, global head of institutional client activity and BlackRock Solutions, becomes COO, while Richard Kushel, deputy to Hallac, is promoted to chief product officer. The reshuffle was put in place in order to allow Hallac to take time off as he receives treatment for colon cancer.Hallac becomes co-chairman, with responsibility for strategy, talent development and future technologies. Other young directors are promoted, including Mark McCome, Mark Wiedman, Quintin Price and Gary Shedlin, adds the FT.
