BT pension fund founds its own insurance company


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } The pension fund for the BT group has taken special measures to meet up to longevity risks. The largest British defined-contribution pension fund, which has about 320,000 members, has created its own insurance company, in partnership with Prudential Insurance Co, which will cover 25% of the total exposure ot the programme to longevity risks, totalling about GBP16bn in liabilities. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), each additional year of life expectancy results in an increase in engagements from a traditional pension fund of about 3% to 4%. The insurance company created by BT will receive premiums from the pension fund, in exchange for which the insurer will take on longevity risks on the basis of life expectancy tables and any potential underestimation. Other British insurers have already set up similar longevity swaps. In March this year, Aviva transferred its longevity risks from participants in its pension programme to three reinsurers. Agreements of this type signed since the first of this kind, signed by Babcock in May 2009, represent about GBP32bn, according to figures from Aon Hewitt. With the new BT initiative, this figure moves closer to GBP50bn.
