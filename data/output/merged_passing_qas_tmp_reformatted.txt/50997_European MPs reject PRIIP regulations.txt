European MPs reject PRIIP regulations


There has been a serious setback for PRIIP regulations. In a full session of European Parliament on 14 September, members of the European Parliament rejected this proposed legislation to protect retail investors, on the grounds that it is too “vicious and misleading” and may actually cause the aforementioned investors to lose their money. In an unusual move, the Parliament sent the proposed legislation to the European Commission for revision. The European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA) immediately welcomed the decision by Parliament.European MPs have passed a resolution calling for changes to legislation for packaged retail insurance-based investment products (PRIIPs), voting 602 in favour, four against, and 12 abstaining. “Retail investors generally use PRIIPs to generate funds to pay mortgages or finance the education of their children,” the European Parliament writes in a statement.The Parliament has also backed the viewpoint of the economic and monetary committee (ECON), which in early September, had already rejected the proposed PRIIPs regulations. According to ECON, “the regulatory technical standards (RTS) proposed, which investment providers will be required to respect to ensure greater transparency and clarity for investors, are inadequate.”The ball is now in the court of the European Commission. The Commission “will now have to propose new regulatory technical standards to implement the PRIIPs legislation, which will need to come into effect on 31 December 2016,” the European Parliament says in its statement.The original bill had aimed to improve information for savings investors, including costs of their unit-linked life insurance products. But these technical standards had the reverse effect, with some insurers even threatening to cut back their product ranges as a result of the complexity, cost and number of documents required to provide to savings investors.
