Bill Miller pumps for large caps


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } 2011 may be an excellent year for equities, many managers predict. The question, of course, is which ones. There is no agreement on this subject. Several major US managers are sticking by their picks, despite criticism from their peers, Bloomberg reports. The chairman and chief investment officer of Legg Mason, Bill Miller, estimates, that 2010 was the right time to buy large caps. He persists and claims that 2011 will be a year to bring that prediction to fruition, despite 2010 having given it the lie. His flagship fund, dedicated to large caps, the Legg Mason Capital Management Value Trust, with about USD4bn in assets, gained 6.6% in 2010, less than 98% of funds in the same category, according to Bloomberg statistics. However, Miller’s fund dedicated to midcaps (USD2bn), the Legg Mason Capital Management Opportunitey Trust, has gained 17%. Donald Yacktman, who in 2000 predicted that US equities would gain ground in the next ten years, is also backing large caps. His fund, the Yacktman Focused Fund (USD1.9bn), did less well than 75% of similar funds. “In 40 years, I have rarely seen a situation where so many large and profitable multinational companies were selling at such low prices,” Yacktman says.
