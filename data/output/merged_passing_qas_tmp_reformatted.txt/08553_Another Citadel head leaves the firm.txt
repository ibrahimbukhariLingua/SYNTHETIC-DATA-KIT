Another Citadel head leaves the firm


Kenneth Griffin, founder of Citadel Investment Group, last week asked Patrik Edsparr, head of the securities division, to leave the hedge fund management firm due to differences over business strategy and the culture of the firm more generally, the Wall Street Journal reports. Edsparr has not been replaced sof ar, but Citadel is planning to seek an external candidate for the position. The move is a further sign that Griffin has more work to do to stabilise the ranks at the firm.
