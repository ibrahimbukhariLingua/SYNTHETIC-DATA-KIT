BNY Mellon IM to abandon its retail activity in Asia


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } BNY Mellon Investment Management (BNY Mellon IM) is reportedly currently studying its options to withdraw from its retail distribution activity in Asia, Asian Investor reports, citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter. At present the US asset management firm has USD102bn in assets under management in Asia, two thirds of which originate from institutional investors. BNY Mellon IM has seen several departures of senior management figures from its teams in the region, the Asian website points out. For example, in July, Stuart Guinness left his position as managing director and product director for mutual funds. Then in September, Dikson Mak, former product manager, left the asset management firm to join Old Mutual Global Investors as senior product and strategy manager. Both had worked at BNY Mellon IM in Hong Kong for one year, and are not expected to be replaced, the same sources say.
