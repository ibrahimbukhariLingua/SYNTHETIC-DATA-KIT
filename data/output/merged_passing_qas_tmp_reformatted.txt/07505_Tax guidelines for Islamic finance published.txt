Tax guidelines for Islamic finance published


Les Echos reports that fiscal instructions which aim to make Paris a hub for Islamic finance in continental Europe were published on 24 August by the French government. The instructions cover “sukuk” operations (issuing securities representing cooperative ownership of a tangible asset or the proceeds of the asset), “murabaha” (when the issuer acts as an intermediary: a vendor sells an assets to an Islamic financial actor, who resells them to an investor for a price payable at some time in the future), “ijara” (a type of rental, in which the investor buys equipment and rents it to a business), and “istisna’a” (a contract by which one party asks another party to build a project in exchange for payment, which is guaranteed when construction is complete).
