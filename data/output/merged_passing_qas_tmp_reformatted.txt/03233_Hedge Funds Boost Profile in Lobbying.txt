Hedge Funds Boost Profile in Lobbying


Many hedge funds were relieved last week when the Obama administration’s financial overhaul plan included no big surprises or threats to their industry. It isn’t clear exactly why hedge funds escaped their worst fears. But maybe one explanation is that they have been spending a lot more time and money in Washington during the past few years. According to The Wall Street Journal, in 2008, major hedge funds and their trade groups spent USD6.1m lobbying Washington, up from USD4.2 million in 2007, which is about seven times the USD897,000 average from 2003 to 2006. The growth rate in hedge-fund lobbying far exceeds the 38% increase for the overall financial-services industry between 2006 and 2008, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
