Lufthansa targeted by funds


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } On Monday morning, Lufthansa announced in a stock exchange release that the former chairman of its managing board (until 2010), the Austrian Wolfgang Mayrhuber, would be withdrawing his candidacy for the chair of the supervisory board at a general shareholders’ meeting on Tuesday, due to opposition from “influential shareholders” (being Union Investment, Franklin Templeton and the consultancy Institutional Shareholder Services, or ISS), the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. However, on Monday evening, Mayrhuber had ultimately once again become a candidate, after apparently accepting the conditions imposed by the recalcitrant shareholders. The first two had criticized the unfortunate strategic decisions taken by Mayrhuber at the time (2002-2010), when he was chairman of the managing board, while ISS faulted him for accepting six appointments as a director since quitting the operational management of the airline.
