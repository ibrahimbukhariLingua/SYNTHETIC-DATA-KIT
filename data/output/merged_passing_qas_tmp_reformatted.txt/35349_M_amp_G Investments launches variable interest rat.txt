The product, managed by James Tomlins, “allows retail investors to protect the value of their bond investments against interest rate rises,” the British asset management firm says. The fund is largely invested in global variable rate high yield bond markets, and pays a variable income which is revised every three months,” M&G explains in a press statement. “For the first time, retail investors in the United Kingdom and continental Europe will have access to the variable rate high yield bond markets via an investment fund,” Tomlins comments. “This fund offers not only bond investors concerned about the risk of an interest rate rise a means to protect their investment, but it also allows them to participate in increasing returns,” the manager adds.
