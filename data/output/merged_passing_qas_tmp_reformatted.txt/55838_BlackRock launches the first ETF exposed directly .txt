p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } BlackRock is launching the first ETF to allow European investors to invest directly in the Israeli stock market index. The iShares TA-25 Israel UCITS ETF is the first ETF in the world to offer direct exposure to the top 25 companies listed on the Tel Aviv stock exchange. The underlying index of the fund, TA-25, limits the size of the shares which compose it, so that no company can represent more than 10% of the index. The composition of the index is reviewed every six months. The iShares TA-25 Israel UCITS ETF index has a total expense ratio of 0.6%. It is a physical replication fund, which offers direct exposure to the underlying shares of the index.
