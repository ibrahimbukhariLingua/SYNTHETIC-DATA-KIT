Class-action settlements on the rise in the United States in 2009


A study recently published by Cornerstone Research (Securities Class Action Settlements: 2009 Review and Analysis) finds that the amounts recuperated by plaintiffs in class-action lawsuits rose by more than 39% compared with 2008, to USD3.83bn, while the number of cases settled increased by only 6.2% year on year, to 103. The average size of class action settlements, correspondingly, increased to USD37m in 2009 from USD28m one year earlier.
