Source launches an ETF dedicated to fintechs


The ETF provider Source on 13 March announced the launch of its first European UCITS fund focused exclusively on financial technology companies (Fintechs), entitled Source KBW Nasdaq Fintech Ucits. “The fintech sector has been experiencing some of the strongest growth of the century, but it was difficult to gain exposure to this sector until now,” the asset management firm explains in a statement. The new ETF aims to track the KBW Nasdaq Financial Technology index, which includes fintech companies listed on the US stock markets. The index currently includes 50 stocks , including big names like PayPal and Visa, and new arrivals such as the point of sale payment application Square, with market capitalisations ranging from USD1bn to over USD150bn. “The 50 companies are weighted evenly, to guarantee that the entire sector will perform well, and that it will not be dominated by the largest players,” Source says. The new ETF is listed on the London Stock Exchange. Its management fees are 0.49%.
