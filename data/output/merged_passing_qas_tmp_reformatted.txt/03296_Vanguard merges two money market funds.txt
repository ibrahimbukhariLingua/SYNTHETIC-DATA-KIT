Vanguard merges two money market funds


Vanguard has announced plans to merge its Vanguard Treasury Money Market Fund (USD6.7bn) with the Vanguard Admiral Treasury Money Market Fund (USD21.8bn), whose fees are lower (0.15%, compared with 0.28%). The merger will take place in early August. The management firm has also frozen subscriptions to the Vanguard Treasury Money Market Fund, which may slow the fundâ€™s declining performance.
