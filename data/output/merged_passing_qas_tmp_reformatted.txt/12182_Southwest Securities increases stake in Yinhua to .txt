Southwest Securities increases stake in Yinhua to 49%


Shanxi Haixin Industrial Corporation has sold a 20% stake in the fund management firm Yinhua (the eighth-largest in China, with a market share of 3.1%) for CNY1.18bn to Southwest Securities, which now controls 49% on Yinhua.According to Z-Ben Advisors, the amount paid by Southwest Securities (based in Chongqing) corresponds to 8% of assets, though Shanxi Haixin paid the same amount for a 21% stake in 2007. That amount was then equivalent to 5.23% of total assets.Southwest Securities now controls two fund management firms, after acquiring Guodo Securities earlier this year. Guodo controls 47% of Lombarda China. The legal limit has not yet been reached, as Chinese companies are allowed to control one majority stake and one minority stake in fund management firms.
