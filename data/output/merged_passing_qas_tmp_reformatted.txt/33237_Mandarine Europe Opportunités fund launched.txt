Mandarine Europe Opportunités fund launched


Mandarine Gestion has announced that it is adding to its “Growth” unit with the launch of the Mandarine Europe Opportunités fund, which invests in European growth shares of all cap sizes. It is managed by Marie-Jeanne Missoffe, who joined the team led by Joëlle Morlet-Selmer and Diane Bruno from SPGP in late 2012 (see NewsManagers of 23 October, 2012). Mandarine Europe Opportunités is actively managed, and fully invested in equities (90% to 100%) without the constraint of a benchmark, sector or cap size. Within an investment universe of 250 shares, 50 to 60 are selected to construct the portfolio. Three perennial drivers of growth have been identified for stock-picking by the manager: innovation, leadership and geographical diversification. The sectoral and geographical structure of the portfolio are then adjusted according to a top-down analysis. The “Growth” unit at Mandarine Gestion now includes three funds specialised in growth equities: France, with Mandarine Opportunités, European Small and Mid caps with Mandarine Unique, and now Europe, with Mandarine Europe Opportunités.
