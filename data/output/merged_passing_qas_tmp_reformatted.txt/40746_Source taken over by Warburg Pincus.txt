Source taken over by Warburg Pincus


The asset management firm Source, one of the major European players in the exchange-traded product (ETP) markets, will this Monday announced that an affiliate of the private equity firm Warburg Pincus has agreed to acquire a majority stake in Source. The existing shareholders, who include five of the largest investment banks in the world (BofA Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley et Nomura), will retain a minority stake. The investment is a sign of the considerable potential for growth in assets and multiple possibilities for product development for investors on European ETP markets. It also strengthens the position of Source as a dynamic and independent asset manager. Lee Kranefuss, currently resident manager at Warburg Pincus, will join Source as executive chairman, and will work in close collaboration with the current management, led by CEO Tom Hood, to develop the activity.
