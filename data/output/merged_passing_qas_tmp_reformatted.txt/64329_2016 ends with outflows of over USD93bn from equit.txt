2016 ends with outflows of over USD93bn from equity funds


As the end of the year approached, inflows to mutual funds slowed considerably. Trends which could be seen since mid-November were still present, but investors also showed a fresh appetite for some bond strategies, which had often been ignored in the wake of the election of Donald Trump to the White House, due to the prospect of interest rate hikes and additional costs for non-US dollar borrowers.International bond funds posted positive net inflows for the second consecutive week, which had not been seen since mid-October, while European bond funds had their largest net inflows of the past 17 weeks, the global flow specialist EPFR Global noted in its weekly statement. The year can be expected to finish with USD93bn in net outflows from equities, the highest level since the 2008 crisis, Bank of America Merrill Lynch remarks in its weekly study, based on the data from EPFR Global.Bond funds overall have seen net inflows of USD3.4bn in the week to 28 December. Funds dedicated to high yield bonds and those specialised in bank loans between them attracted a net total of over USD3bn. The weekly Bank of America Merrill Lynch study points out that European bond funds have seen inflows of over USD1bn. Emerging market bond funds have seen further net outflows, but totalling only USD0.2bn. Equity funds of all regions combined have posted net outflows of EUR1bn, with a net outflow of USD1.6bn from US equity funds, while European equity funds have also seen outflows, but totalling a negligible USD40m. However, funds specialised in Japanese equities have finished the week with positive inflows of USD2.4bn, the highest in the past seven weeks, and emerging market equity funds have seen net outflows of USD2.5bn.
