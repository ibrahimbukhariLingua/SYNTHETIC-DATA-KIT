Reform of derivative markets is behind schedule


The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has expressed concern about the delays in many countries in implementing reforms to over-the-counter derivative markets. In a progress report published on 11 October, the international organisation points out that the G20 had set the end fo 2012 as the deadline to set up a new regulatory framework in this area. According to the FSB, the United States is currently the only country in a position to meet that deadline. The Dodd-Frank law, passed in mid-2010, will soon be brought into force by the two market regulatory agencies in the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the FSB states. In Europe, the two draft derivative market legislative measures (the MiFID II and Emir directives) have not yet taken the form of final proposals by the European Commission.
