Paris hedge fund unveils AI SRI US equity fund


Paris-based alternative manager Boussard & Gavaudan has launched a US equity fund taking into ESG criteria and relying on machine learning technics developed by Bramham Gardens Investments, a Parisian company focused on artificial intelligence. The BG AI US Equities SRI was launched on 13 September 2018 and seeks to be aligned with the UN Global Compact principles. It invests primarily in US large cap companies while excluding firms that violate the rules set by the UN Global Compact through an ESG analysis and review conducted by an independent ESG rating agency. Also companies involved in the production of weapons and anti-personnel mines do not form part of the fundâ€™s investment universe. In addition to this fund launch, Boussard & Gavaudan has started marketing its BG AI Long Short Equity fund towards German investors since German financial market authority gave its green light for the distribution of the product at the end of October. It is the fourth fund to be marketed in Germany by Boussard & Gavaudan.
