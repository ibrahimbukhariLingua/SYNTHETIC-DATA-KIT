BNP Paribas completes blockchain test fund transaction


In a series of tests conducted in late 2017, BNP Paribas Asset Management (“BNPP AM”) has announced that it has successfully completed its first transaction to subscribe to a fund using blockchain technologies throughout the transaction chain. The test was carried out using the blockchain programme at BNP Paribas Securities Services, Fund Link, and FundsDLT, a decentralised platform which uses blockchain to process subscription and redemption operations for fund shares. FundsDLT is a joint initiative of FundSquare (an affiliate of the Luxembourg stock exchange), InTech (an affiliate of the POST Group) and KPMG Luxembourg.The test confirms the ability of platforms to make a link between various blockchains and is the first to rely on interoperability of independent blockchains. This also marks a key step in fund distribution. The transaction covered every part of the process, from the order instruction up to the execution of the operation. “BNPP AM thus becomes one of the first major international asset management firms to complete a test subscription to funds via blockchain technology. This new development falls fully in line with its growth plan, which places innovation and technology at the heart of strategy. This allows it to strengthen its position as a top provider of digital investment solutions for fund distribution,” a statement says.
