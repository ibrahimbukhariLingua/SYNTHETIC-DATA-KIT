Natixis AM launches a short-term high yield bond fund


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Natixis AM has launched the Natixis Short Term Global High Income Fund, a sub-fund of the Luxembourg-registered SICAV Natixis International Funds (Lux), which invests in high yield and short term bonds whose issuers are domiciled in OECD countries, and which have a sensitivity of under 2 years. The Natixis Short Term Global High Income Fund uses an active strategy subject to the constraints of a benchmark and its sectoral allocation. The management team pays particular attention to liquidity, solvency, the structure of debt, and the business model of issuers. As a complement to a bottom-up management process, the two co-managers, Nolwenn Le Roux and Vincent Marioni, SFAF, have set internal maximal holding criteria for each sector and issuer, in order to ensure optimal diversification of the portfolio. The portfolio of the Natixis Short Term Global High Income Fund is composed of 90 international stocks as of 16 April 2014.
