Synthetic ETFs are not better than physical replication ones


A study by Christian Meinhardt, Sigrid Müller, and Stefan Schöne of the Institute of Finance at Humboldt University in Berlin, of 68 integral physical replication ETFs and 218 synthetic replication ETFs, all of them listed in Frankfurt, has demonstrated empirically that synthetic replication is not better than physical replication, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. It also carries more risk, as a result of counterparty risks.However, synthetic replication ETFs bring better results than physical replication ETFs in fixed income. But, the scholars point out, in both formats, there is significant divergence from the index.
