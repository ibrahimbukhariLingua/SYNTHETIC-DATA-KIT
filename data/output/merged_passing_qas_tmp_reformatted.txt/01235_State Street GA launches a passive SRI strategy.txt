State Street GA launches a passive SRI strategy


State Street Global Advisors, a specialist in portfolio management, announced on Monday, 7 October, that it has launched an index-based strategy based on the US Community Investing Index, which will aim to replicate the returns and characteristics of the socially responsible investment (SRI) index US Community Investing IndexTM (USCII). The index is composed of 300 large and midcap firms “in all sectors, which have proven their success and their proactive engagement with disadvantaged rural and urban communities in the United States,” says a statement from State Street Advisors. The USCII fund applies a methodology which positively evaluates the investment performance and social engagement of many businesses on the basis of three criteria: strategic alignment, professional development and creation of wealth, and social engagement and business sponsorship.
