Norway - Former Oil Fund considers tobacco boycott


In a review of its ethical investment policies, the Government Pension Fund - Global, formerly known as the Oil Fund, may establish a policy against investment in tobacco companies, along with firms that contribute most to climate change, says finance minister Kristin Halborsen. The Wall Street Journal also reports that the finance ministry is not planning to modify the fundâ€™s overall investment strategy, but may limit its room to maneuver in active management. However, a spokesperson for the Bank of Norway has stated that as far as it is concerned, active management is an adequate format for the fund.
