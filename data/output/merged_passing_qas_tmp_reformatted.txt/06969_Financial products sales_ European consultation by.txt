Financial products sales: European consultation by the end of the year


The European Commission will open a consultation before the end of the year on proposed regulations which would cover all retail investment products, Sonia Cattarinussi, a member of the DG Market asset management team of the European Commission, announced on 7 October at the 9th annual asset management forum hosted by Agefi.The products are known by the acronym PRIPS (Package Retail Investment Products), which, Cattarinussi says, may lose the letter P, to become RIPS. These products would include collective management and some banking products, including stock market investment products and all or part of life insurance and retirement products.Precontractual information would be distributed in the KID format (the simplified prospectus containing key information for the investor) under UCITS IV, while for the second phase, advising at the point of sale, MiFID regulations now in course would form the basis for harmonisation.
