AMF publishes a list of unauthorised companies


The French financial regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), on Monday issued a warning against the irregular activities of several websites which claim to offer high yield investments. Three products, offered by several firms, are targeted; Isostable, Serenity and Toppack, which are offered by the New Solutions Trading Limited company, and which are supposed to offer returns of 5%, 8% or 10% per month. “These companies do not have the necessary licenses to provide investment services in France, including investment advising and/or portfolio management for third parties,” the AMF states. The regulator also recommends that investors not respond to sales propositions from the following companies, and not to relay those propositions to third parties in any form whatsoever: - www.d2c-finances.fr (D2C FINANCES, 12 rue des Pellois 41300 La Ferté Imbault)- www.neo-invest.com (NEO INVEST, 57/2 quai Donat Casterman, 7500 Tournai Belgique))- www.sdc-newtrading.krysos.fr (SDC-INVEST and SDC-NEW TRADING Le HautTrégonneau 44500 Montoir de Bretagne)- www.newsolutionstrading.com (New Solutions Trading Ltd, P.O.
