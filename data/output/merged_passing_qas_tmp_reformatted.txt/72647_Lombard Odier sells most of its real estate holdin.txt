Lombard Odier sells most of its real estate holdings in Geneva


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; }a:link { } The private bank Lombard Odier is selling off most of its properties in Geneva, specifically in the rue de la Corraterie. The firm has sold several buildings located on this artery in the city centre, and is retaining only its historic headquarters, at number 15. In total, 10 properties have been sold to Axa Winterthur. The transaction totals nearly CHF300m, the insurance company says in a statement. The sale is not a surprise. Lombard Odier has decided to transfer its activities to Bellevue, to new headquarters to be constructed. Until this is completed, which is slated for 2021, the private bank will continue to be based in the rue de la Corraterie.
