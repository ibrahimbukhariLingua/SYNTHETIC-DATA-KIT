Palatine AM adds to range of SRI funds


Palatine Asset Management, the asset management affiliate of Banque Palatine, on 26 June announced the launch of the Palatine Entreprises Familiales ISR fund, a themed vehicle focused on family-owned businesses in the euro zone. From 1 June 2017, the product replaces the Gérer Multifactoriel Euro fund. The management of the new fund is provided by Marie-Pierre Guern, equity manager at Palatine AM since 2001. Palatine Entreprises Familiales ISR will invest at least 50% in family groups listed in the euro zone, in which at least 10% of capital is controlled by one or more families, the asset management firm says. These families may also hold a seat on the board of directors or have a representative director. The fund will also be focused on sustainable development via corporate social responsibility, and responsible environmental, social and governance policies, “which are often at the core of governance and the strategy of family businesses,” Palatine AM says.
