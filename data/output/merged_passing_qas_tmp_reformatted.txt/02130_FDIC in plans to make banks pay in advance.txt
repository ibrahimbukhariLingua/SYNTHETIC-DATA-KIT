FDIC in plans to make banks pay in advance


Agefi reports that the agency that guarantees banking deposits in the United States, the FDIC, whose special guarantee fund is financed by premiums paid by insured institutions, decided on Tuesday by a unanimous vote of its board to ask banks to pay their premiums in advance for a period of three years, in order to bring in USD45bn in reserves. As of 17 September 2009, the liquidator for bankrupt banks guaranteed deposits totalling a cumulative USD4.8trn, at 8,134 savings institutions, with total assets of USD13trn. If the proposal is approved, banks will be required to pay their contributions for fourth quarter 2009 and for the years 2010-2012 to the guarantee fund by 30 December.
