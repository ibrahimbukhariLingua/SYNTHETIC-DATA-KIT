Sovereign funds remain too dependent on politics


Sovereign funds remain too little legible and too dependent on the influence of politics. Only one third of the 26 sovereign funds which have signed the Santiago generally accepted principles and practices (GAPP) which aims to promote the “objectives and finality of sovereign funds” passed the good governance, transparency and resopnsibility tests, acording to a sruvey by the Swiss consulting firm GeoEconomica.The survey finds that many sovereign funds, particularly Russian and Middle Eastern funds. Do not respect the basic principles fo good governance or financial information at all.Pension funds from the Norwegisan government top the rankings, with a rating of 94% on the Santiago Principles compliance scale, while sovereign funds from Bahrain take the bottom spots in the rankings, with only 24%. The global ratio is 70%.According to the survey, five funds, which received ratings of under 50%, do not respect the Principles, particuarly since they do not publish financial information.One of the most dynamic sovereign funds, QIA (Qatar Investment Authority), does not offer satisfactory information concerning mandates, its financial reports or its governance framework. The fund received a rating of only 31%.
