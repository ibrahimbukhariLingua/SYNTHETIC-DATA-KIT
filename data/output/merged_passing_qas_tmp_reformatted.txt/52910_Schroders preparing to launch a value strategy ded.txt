Schroders preparing to launch a value strategy dedicated to credit


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The British firm Schroders is currently working on a new value strategy dedicated to credit which may be launched in September 2016, Konstantin Leidman, a manager specialised in European credit, said in Paris on 6 June, at a conference about bonds. The unconstrained strategy is primarily aimed at investment opportunities without consensus or the constraints in the global high yield bond universe. The objective is to earn total annual returns of 6% to 9% over a period of five years, in a perimeter which is underexplored by long-only credit funds.
