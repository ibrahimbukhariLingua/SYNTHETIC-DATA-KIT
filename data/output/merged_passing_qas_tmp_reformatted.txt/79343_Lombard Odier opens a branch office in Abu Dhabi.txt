Lombard Odier opens a branch office in Abu Dhabi


Lombard Odier is preparing to open a branch office in Abu Dhabi, to strengthen its presnce in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It becomes the first Swiss private bank to open an office in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) international business centre. The new branch office will come as an addition to the Lombard Odier representative office in Dubai, opened 12 years ago. Since 2007, Lombard Odier has steadily grown in the region, doubling its staff size. “The decision to extend our activities in the United Arab Emirates is a sign of our confidence in the growth and economic stability of the region, and the future of the Emirates as a prosperous business centre. Creating a branch office in the capital of the United Arab Emirates will bring us even closer to our clients, and will allow us to offer them local and custom solutions on site,” says Arnaud Leclercq, partner and head of new markets at Lombard Odier. Lombard Odier will be located in the ADGM, and will offer Abu Dhabi clients a range of international investments, as well as solutions which are compliant with Islamic finance. In 2018, the discretionary mandate range from the bank was certified as compliant with the principles of Sharia by the Sharia surveillance board at Amanie Advisors. The Abu Dhabi office, which will be directed by Christophe Lalandre, has been approved in principle by the ADGM supervisory authority, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA). The issuance of the license is now pending final approval by the regulatory authorities. Lalandre is currently head of the Dubai office, where a recruitment is in progress.
