Pension funds have growing appetite for alternative investment


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Pension funds have increased their exposure to alternative investments, according to a survey performed by State Street in partnership with the research unit of the Economist EIU of more than 130 pension funds worldwide. More than three quarters of respondents to the survey (77%) say that their appetite for risk will increase in the next three years. In a context of interest rates remaining very low, pension funds will invest in alternative assets. More precisely, 60% of pension funds are planning to expose themselves to private equity, 54% to direct loans, 46% to real estate and 39% to infrastructure. And 29% of pension funds which already invest in hedge funds are planning to increase their allocation, while 25% are investing in the asset class for the first time. Another finding of the survey is that more than half of hedge funds (53%) would like to increase their use of low-cost investment strategies, such as passive strategies. Another trend noted by the survey is a desire on the part of pension funds as a whole to internally reintegrate the management of their portfolios, particularly for questions of cost: on average, pension funds dedicate 46 basis points to external management, compared with only 8 basis points for management carried out internally.
