4% increase in assets under management at GAM in first half


The wealth management firm GAM on 14 August announced a 4% increase in its assets under management in first half 2012, to CHF111.1bn, compared with CHF107.0bn as of the end of December 2011. “This growth primarily reflects a decline on the market of CHF2.9bn, positive currency effects (CHF0.3bn), and appreciation of currencies (US dollar, pound sterling) against the Swiss franc, which offset the falling euro,” GAM says in a statement. Meanwhile, net inflows totalled CHF0.9bn, compared with CHF0.6bn in first half 2011 and redemptions in second half 2011. Net operating profits totalled CHF70.2bn, compared with CHF100.4bn, while pre-tax profits totalled CHF87.1m (CHF124.7m), which corresponds to a decine of 30% in both cases.
