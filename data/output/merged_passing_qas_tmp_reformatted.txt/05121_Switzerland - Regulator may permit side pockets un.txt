Switzerland - Regulator may permit side pockets under certain conditions


On Friday, the Swiss federal financial market surveillance authority (FINMA) announced, with many precautions, that side pockets may be approved, under certain circumstances, for Swiss funds of hedge funds (FoHF). The creation of side pockets may not be undertaken without the prior approval of FINMA, and must be in the interests of all investors. The rights of investors must also be preserved at the creation of the side pockets, the regulator emphasizes.
