State Street analyses the impact of wave of regulations on asset management sector


MiFID II, UCITS IV, PRIP, ICSD... The European asset management sector is facing a massive wave of new regulations. In its last VISION report, entitled “The Changing Shape of Asset Management,” State Street examines the impact of regulatory changes on the asset management sector in Europe, and its consequences for competition and the performance of investments. “The challenge for asset managers, regardless of their size, will be to remain concentrated on their main activity; in other words, to construct high-performance investment portfolios. They will be easily distracted from this objective by the high volume of regulations to come,” says Marty Dobbins, CEO of State Street in Luxembourg. The report also examines how regulations may influence the future development of products. “product development teams will work in close collaboration with their counterparts in risk and compliance services, to ensure that new products comply with standards, are exploitable, and are ready for launch on the market,” says Mike Karpik, senior CEO and chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.” The study may be found at : http://www.statestreet.com/wps/portal/internet/corporate/home/thoughtle…
