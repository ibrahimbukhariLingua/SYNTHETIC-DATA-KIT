One European ETF out of six may be closed


According to a study by Detlef Glow published by Handelsblatt, 294 of the 1,727 ETF funds on sale in Europe had not reached EUR100m in assets within three years as of 30 June. A Lipper expert says that on the basis of experience, this amount over this time is critical for the survival of an ETF fund. However, Detlef Glow does not predict consolidation in the industry, as issuers are seeking to attract new investors with a rising number of new strategies, particularly in actively-managed ETFs.
