United States - Contrafund from Fidelity lost 37.2% in 2008


The Wall Street Journal reports that the Contrafund (USD45.9bn), reopened in mid-December by Fidelity Investments, after being closed to new investors since April 2006, suffered losses of 37.2% last year, which corresponds to roughly the same amount as the S&P 500 lost in the same time, but outperforms other Fidelity heavyweight products, such as the Magellan Fund and the Growth & Income Portfolio. The manager, Will Danoff, admits that he kept his bets on stocks such as Google, Apple, and RIM for too long. However, he correctly adopted an underweight position on IT shares, and performance was considerably improved by a strong exposure to Genetech.
