Commerzbank planning to pull out of KGAL


According to financial industry sources, Commerzbank and Sal. Oppenheim are planning to sell their stakes of 45% and 10%, respectively, in the Bavarian asset management firm KGAL (EUR25.2bn in assets), Handelsblatt reports.The shares may be bought by BayernLB, which owns 30% of capital, and the Hambourg savings bank (Haspa). However, as BayernLB is required by the European Union to reduce its balance sheet, it will not acquire a majority stake in KGAL, which it would then be required to completely consolidate.
