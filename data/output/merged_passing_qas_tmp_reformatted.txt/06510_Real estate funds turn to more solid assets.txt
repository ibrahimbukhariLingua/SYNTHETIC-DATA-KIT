Real estate funds turn to more solid assets


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Investors whose good luck ran out along with the boom times are now turning to “core” real estate assets, mature properties offering good returns, while funds specialised in turnaround situations are continuing to suffer, the Wall Street Journal reports. The CalPERS pension fund has sold off two opportunistic funds from CityView which invest in residential real estate to Blackstone Group for USD225m, including debt. The CalSTRS pension fund has announced that it will increase its allocation to core real estate funds from 35% to 50%, reducing its exposure to higher-risk RE funds from 65% to 50%. Goldman Sachs is launching a range of lower-risk real estate funds in the wake of losses for the Whitehall range of higher-risk real estate funds. The real estate fund from JP Morgan Chase, which previously weighed in at as much as USD11.5bn, has seen net outflows of USD1.8bn during the crisis, but has attracted USD3bn since the beginning of this year.
