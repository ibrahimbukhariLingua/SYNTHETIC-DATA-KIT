HSBC adds to range pf products denominated in renminbi


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } HSBC France is adding to its range of products denominated in renminbi aimed at businesses. Two services are offered, depending on investment horizon and risk appetite: a fixed-date savings denominated in renminbi, and the HSBC GIF RMB Fixed Income fund. This is a public/private bond fund denominated in Chinese currency, with an investment horizon of at least 5 years. The fund had previously been reserved for institutional and retail investors. “These new product ranges meet a growing need for businesses to diversify their investments and to make returns off their excess cash, while benefiting from remuneration conditions which are now more attractive than the euro or dollar, and from the rising renminbi market,” HSBC says.
