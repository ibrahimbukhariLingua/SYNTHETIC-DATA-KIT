ML Fund Managers Survey: Investors remain optimistic but prudent


Last month, investorsâ€™ optimism strengthened after a strong rally in the month of August and a scenario of economic recovery looking likely, according to the Merrill Lynch Fund Manager Survey for September. Less than one third of investors predict that there will be a continued recession, while two thirds of them predicted that the recession would continue only two months ago. However, the number of managers who were overweight in cash has increased to a net total of 10%, compared with 3% the previous month. The percentage of respondents who are overweight in equities has fallen to a net 27% from 34% previously. This increase in cash levels and lower exposure to equities shows that their appetite for risk does not yet reflect confidence in economic recovery, says Gary Baker, head of European equity strategy at Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch Research. For the first time in 18 months, the Euro zone has become a preferred investment destination. Only a net total of 1% of the sample in September is underweight in the Euro zone, compared with 13% in August and 40% in March. In other words, investors no longer seem to consider emerging markets as the only region that can deliver growth.
