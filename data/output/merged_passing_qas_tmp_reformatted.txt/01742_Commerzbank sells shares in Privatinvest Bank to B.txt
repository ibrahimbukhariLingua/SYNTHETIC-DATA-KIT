Commerzbank sells shares in Privatinvest Bank to BCZ


On Tuesday night, Commerzbank announced that it will be selling its 74% stake in the Austrian firm Privatinvest Bank of Salzburg for an undisclosed amount to the Cantonal Bank of Zurich (ZKB in German). The transaction is part of a move at Commerzbank to concentrate on a more limited number of locations for its wealth management activities. The sale of the stake is also a realization of a pledge made by Commerzbank in order to be granted permission by the European Union to receive German government assistance as part of the financial markets stabilisation (SoFFin) program. At the end of June, the Privatinvest Bank, which has 50 employees in Salzburg and Vienna, had assets of EUR600m. The activities of the Vienna branch of Commerzbank are not affected by the announced deal.
