BlackRock CEO writes S&amp;P500 companies


BlackRock chief executive Laurence Fink wrote a letter to the CEO of every S&P 500 company to warn them that dividends and buybacks that activists favor may create quick returns at the expense of long-term investment. «Many commentators lament the short-term demands of the capital markets,» Mr. Fink wrote in the letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. «We share those concerns, and believe it is part of our collective role as actors in the global capital markets to challenge that trend.»
