Kneip teams up with Cetrel to offer regulatory document deposit and fund distribution service


Kneip and Cetrel Securities on 13 September announced the launch of the first international initial notification and written notification platform, intended to facilitate management, distribution and optimal tracking of documents related to investment funds. The platform is a step forward in the area of regulatory document deposit, as it brings the investment fund industry 40% lower prices than those available on the market previously, a statement says. The service will also be integrated into a more extended documentation solution, which will allow asset managers to optimally distribute documents related to investment funds to distributors and financial intermediaries, as well as to public websites, in compliance with the requirements of UCITS IV.
