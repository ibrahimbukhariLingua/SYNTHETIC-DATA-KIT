John Paulson seeks to divert attention away from his gold fund


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } John Paulson would like investors to stop focusing on his bets on gold, the Wall Street Journal reports. The billionaire fund manager was one of the most bullish investors in the precious metal, and suffered heavy losses as a result. His USD18bn firm will now cease to include the performance of its gold fund in monthly bulletins to investors, according to a letter sent to investors on Thursday. Paulson regrets that problems with the gold fund have eclipsed the good performance of his other funds. The gold fund and other strategies in that area represent only 2% of assets at the firm.
