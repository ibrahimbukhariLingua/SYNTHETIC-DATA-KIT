British investors are underweight on venture capital


The majority of British independent financial advisers (IFAs) feel that sophisticated investors are underweight on the venture capital sector, according to a survey carried out by Albion Ventures. Advisers say that less than one fifth of their clients (17%) are directly exposed to venture capital, but 48% of them say that the exposure of their clients to venture capital is likely to rise in the next five years.
