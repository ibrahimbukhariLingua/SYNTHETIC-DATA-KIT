In order to acquire Geneva Capital Management, Henderson Global Investors is paying USD130m immediately, in addition to which USD70m will be paid depending on the future earnings of the company. With this acquisition, Henderson Global Investors increases its volume of US equity assets under management to USD18bn, or about 15% of its total assets. This allows it in particular to quadruple its assets for US institutionals. The transaction offers Henderson the opportunity to launch new US equity products and to improve its position serving US institutionals, according to a statement. “Developing our presence in North America is a strategic priority for Henderson, which will increase our assets under management in the United States by more than 50% … and increase our US institutional client base,” says Andrew Formica, CEO of Henderson GI.
