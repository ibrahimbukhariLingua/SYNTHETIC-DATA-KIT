Vontobel teams up with Bank of Singapore for private banking


The Swiss banking group Vontobel on 6 February announced that it has signed a strategic alliance with Bank of Singapore, to allow clients of the Singapore private bank to place their assets in Switzerland with the Zurich-based bank. The agreement is also expected to allow the bank to benefit from all services and financial products from Vontobel. “Clients of Bank of Singapore may select Vontobel or Bank of Singapore to manage their assets deposited in Zurich,” Vontobel says in a statement.“This agreement will allow us to better meet the expectations of Asian clients, who are increasingly interested in placing their assets in our centres in Hong Kong and Singapore as well as in Switzerland,” says Olivier Denis, global market head at Bank of Singapore, in a statement. “With this new expertise, we are one of the few Asian private banks to be able to offer a wide range of services to our clients in three major financial centres: Singapore, Hong Kong, and Switzerland.” Brian Fischer, director of external assets at Vontobel, says the agreement represents “a new stage in the international development of our offerings of services for financial institutions”.
