Hedge fund transparency has improved


According to a Preqin survey of investitutional investors, the transparency of hedge funds has noticeably improved in the past 12 months. About 96% of investors interviewed estimate that the level of hedge fund transparency has risen, from only 42% previously. They survey also indicates that no investors saw a decline in their transparency levels. The survey also finds that 84% of institutional investors say that they would not remain invested in a fund which did not meet their utmost requirements in terms of transparency. Funds of hedge funds are particularly sensitive on this point, as some vehicles which were exposed to Bernard Madoff turned in poor returns in 2008. “A large increase in transparency needs to be integrated into the culture of hedge funds, and the ‘black box’ era needs to end,” the survey says. Since the financial crisis, 78% of investors have improved operational due diligence for their hedge funds, while 22% of investors say that they have not modified their surveillance procedures.

Investors also insist on the need for information about risk profiles, as well as about the management of hedge funds, including, for example, VaR or exposure to counterparties. Last but not least, more than 50% of investors want reassurance about the liquidity levels of funds.
