UBP launches new equity strategy


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { } The Swiss asset management firm UBP is launching the new “Equity Flex” strategy, which provides exposure to equities, while controlling risks. “In a context in which volatility causes fear with significant drawdown risks, this strategy offers exposure to the European equity market, but with a risk management engine to manage volatility,” Bernard Kalfon, head of volatility and risk management strategy at the Union Bancaire Privée (UBP) group, said in Paris at a presentation to investors.The objective and strategy are to offer a positive asymmetrical risk profile for a long-term investment horizon. The means used to achieve this objective are original. The strategy combines two areas of expertise of the group: firstly, a long-only strategy with direct exposure to equities via the UBAM-Europe Equity fund; and then, a dynamic risk management overlay. The beta objective of the portfolio is a total of 50% to 100% of assets under management.This strategy, which “makes it possible to serenely return to equities with a dynamic product,” says Kalfon, is already available on the Irish market. It will be available to French investors in autumn, probably in September.
