Private equity is optimistic


John Amey, CEO of the private equity firm Candover, sees the early signs of recovery on the European private equity markets, as equities rise and access to external capital improves, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. In addition, two deals totalling over EUR1bn were signed in fourth quarter 2009, though the total number of deals fell 10% compared with July-September, and volume was down 8% to EUR10bn.
