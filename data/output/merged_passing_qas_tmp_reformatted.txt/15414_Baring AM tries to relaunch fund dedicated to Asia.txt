Baring AM tries to relaunch fund dedicated to Asian frontier markets


Asian Investor reports that Baring Asset Management (Asia) is now looking to promote the growth potential of South-East Asia, in a bid to bring liquidity in for its Asean Frontiers Fund, which has seen a 29% decline in its assets to USD270m, from USD380m last year. The fund is at least 70% invested in the major Asian equities markets: Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, while a 25% portion of the fund is reserved for frontier markets and greater China, with a preference for small and midcaps.
