BlackRock launches a new European equity ETF


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } BlackRock has launched a new physical replication ETF which invests in large and midcaps from developed countries of the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union, while offering hedging against the dollar. The fund, entitled iShares MSCI EMU UDS Hedged UCITS ETF (EMUU), tracks a benchmark index which includes about 240 stocks from 10 developed countries belonging to the European Union. A major point is that the impact of fluctuations on the total return for investors is reduced due to hedging in US dollars. This is the first European equity fund hedged in dollars launched by iShares, the asset management firm says in a statement.
