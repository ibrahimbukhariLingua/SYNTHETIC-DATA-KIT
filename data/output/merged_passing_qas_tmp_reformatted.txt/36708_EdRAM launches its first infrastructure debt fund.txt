p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (EdRAM) is taking shape. The infrastructure debt fund aimed at European institutional investors, announced by Laurent Tignard, the firmâ€™s global CEO, in an interview with Newsmanagers on 2 December 2013, is now complete. BRIDGE (Benjamin de Rothschild Infrastructure Debt Generation), whose first closing EdRAM announces today, represents the first debt fund from the asset management firm. With a total of EUR400m, the securitisation fund will accept investments from French institutionals (pension funds, insurers, large businesses, etc.) seeking to participate in the financing of infrastructure in Europe, and to benefit from more attractive long-term returns. The fund will be managed by France Titrisation, while EdRAM will be responsible for investment advising. The dedicated team, based in London, includes 8 people, led by Jean-Francis Dusch. The BRIDGE 2014-1 sub-fund will invest in France, the United Kingdom, Benelux, Germany, Austria and Scandinavia, with a final closing expected in fourth quarter 2014. It aims to create a portfolio of securities in the transportation, energy (including renewable energy), social infrastructure and telecommunications sectors, in about 10 European Union member countries. The sub-fund will invest in both greenfield and brownfield assets.
