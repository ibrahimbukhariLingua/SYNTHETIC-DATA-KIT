France - GI Forum: Each institutional has its own SRI


In matters of socially responsible investment (SRI), the French association of institutional investors (AF2i) doesn’t want to be prescriptive. ?Our association brings together very different investors, who exist in diverse professional environments. We do not want to create a charter which would come in addition to the ones which already exist,? explains Jean-Claude Guimiot, a board member at AF2i, and also deputy CEO of Agrica Epargne, at a conference organised for the GI Forum.However, the AF2i would like to draw its members’ attention to the need for them to practice responsible investment. But it leaves them some latitude. ?I estimate that there are as many visions of SRI as there are people,? says Guimiot, in an interview with Newsmanagers. ?So there is no single method for all institutional investors,? he continues. Guimiot argues that management firms will need to get used to SRI criteria being set by institutionals.
