Few M&amp;A expected in asset management


European asset managers are set to rationalise further, but a widespread mergers and acquisitions spree is unlikely, Fitch Ratings says. “We do not expect widespread M&A because there are not many large candidates left and deals can bring considerable risks. There could be stark cultural differences among managers and they may also face investor outflows. Other challenges include a negative impact on an asset managers’ credit profile if an acquisition involves debt funding, regulatory hurdles in the approval phase and over-paying in a competitive market, particularly if a bidding war is triggered”, according to the rating agency. Nevertheless, Fitch Ratings expect some further selective M&A activity among European asset managers, particularly where institutional investors increasingly demand scale, such as alternative investment, private equity and real estate. The agency also expect the acquisition of smaller specialists to remain popular ways for asset managers to add competences, products, clients or distribution channels. Finally, European asset managers have also generated interest from overseas parties. These transactions enhanced growth platforms and increased geographical diversification of previously North American- or Asian-focused funds.
