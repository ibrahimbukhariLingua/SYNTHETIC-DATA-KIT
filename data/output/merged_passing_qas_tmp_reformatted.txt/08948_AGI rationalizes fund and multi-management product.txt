AGI rationalizes fund and multi-management product range from cominvest


On 1 March, responsibility for multi-management funds at cominvest was transferred to RCM, an affiliate of Allianz Global Investors (AGI) specialised in equities, since the adviser for these products, SEI Investments, has withdrawn from the German market. The management of these products will now be undertaken by RCM MultiManagement, which already provides the management of the Commerzbank allstars-anlage, Dresdner Verm√∂gensmanagement, cominvest Best-In-One World I and cominvest Multi Asia Active funds.Three of the four remaining multi-management funds at cominvest will be merged with other products: the cominvest Multi Manager Global Balanced III fund will on 14 May be absorbed by the cominvest Multi Manager Global Balanced I. Then, the cominvest Multi Manager Global Dynamic fund will be taken over by the cominvest Best-In-One World I on 16 July, and the cominvest Multi Manager Global Conservative will be absorbed by the Allianz Pimco Rentenfonds on 3 December. The last fund, the cominvest Multi Manager Global Balanced I, will remain, but its asset allocation will become more dynamic. The management team will be allowed to invest not only in AGI funds but also in products from other providers.
