Ossiam launches a smart beta bond ETF


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; } Ossiam, a smart beta specialist asset management firm affiliated to Natixis Investment Managers, has launched the ETF Ossiam Solactive Moody’s Analytics IG EUR Select Credit ETF (MOOC FP) on Euronext Paris. The new smart beta bond ETF replicates the Solactive Moody’s Analytics IG EUR Select Credit index. “This index stands out from traditional credit indices, by seeking to increase returns from a liquid and diversified selection of corporate bonds denominated in euros, rated investment grade, while limiting exposure to credit risk,” a statement says. Stock-picking is based on the public-firm expected default frequency (EDF) indicator from Moody’s Analytics. The prospective measurement of credit risk calculates the probabilities of risk associated with each issuer on the both of information from stock markets and the capital structure of the firm. Combining the EDF™measurements with specific data for each issue, Moody’s Analytics also produces a credit spread measurement, fair value spread (FVS), which can identify potentially undervalued securities. EDF™and FVS are then combined in an approach which highlights liquidity and transaction cost controlling to bring investors exposure to the quality corporate bond segment.
