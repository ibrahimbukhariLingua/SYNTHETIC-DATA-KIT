Carsten Maschmeyer resigns from board at Swiss Life


Carsten Maschmeyer, founder of the German financial services provider AWD Holding, on 7 December resigned with immediate effect form his position as director of Swiss Life Holding, a position he was elected to in 2009, following a decision to reduce his stake in Swiss Life Holding to less than 3% from 5.05% currently. Maschmeyer says in a statement that he is also hoping to spare Swiss Life AWD from the unfounded personal attacks he has been subject to. Maschmeyer is hoping that his decision to resign and sell shares in the firm will put an end to rumours that he had had a direct influence on operational activities at AWD. The German SMB CGI Industrie AG, for its part, announced on 8 December that Maschmeyer has increased his stake in its capital above the 3% and 5% thresholds, the day after a sale of some of his shares in Swiss Life Holding. The transaction was processed via the wealth manager Paladin Asset Management.
