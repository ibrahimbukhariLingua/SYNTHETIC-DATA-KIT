Edmond de Rothschild (France) launches a European equity mandate


Edmond de Rothschild (France) is launching a new Euorpean dividend equity mandate, whose objective is to profit from equity markets through the prism of returns. The group explains in a statement that “although the returns offered by top-ranking bonds barely exceeds a few basis points, the dividends offered by European businesses is showing a robustness that does not let up. The difference in returns has never been so great! For example, the average dividend on the Stoxx 600 is 3.7%, compared with 0.82% for OATs for example.” Within the Stoxx Europe 600 (the 600 largest European caps), portfolio managers apply a series of quantitative filters, with the objective of identifying businesses with an attractive and rising dividend policy over the past few years (about 2.5% to 4%). The emphasis will be put on businesses which have distribution policies that are considered sustainable in light of sufficient available cash flow and proven solidity of performance. Managers then perform an advanced qualitative analysis driven by the fundamentals of the business to select the most promising stocks, while favouring strong sectoral diversification. Management fees will be 10% up to 750,000 in portfolio value, 0.80% from EUR750,000 to EUR2m, 0.60% from EUR2m to EUR5m, and 0.50% over EUR5m. The minimum payout is EUR910 per year.
