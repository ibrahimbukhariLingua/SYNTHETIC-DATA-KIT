The lawsuits were filed in December, but the two brothers-in-law and Picard were involved in secret negotiations.Unlike in other cases, the trustee does not affirm that Wilpon and Katz were complicit with Madoff. He accuses them of having been alerted on several occasions of serious irregularities, but of having done nothing.
