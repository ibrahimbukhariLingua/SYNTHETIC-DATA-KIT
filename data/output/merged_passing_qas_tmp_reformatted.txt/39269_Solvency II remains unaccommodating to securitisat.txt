Solvency II remains unaccommodating to securitisation


P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The most recent alterations to the draft Solvency II directive, which make it more favourable in terms of owners equity, will not necessarily incite European insurers to develop their securitisation activities, Standard & Poor’s finds in a study released on 18 March (“EIOPA’s Revised Solvency II Calibration Still Risks Turning European Insurers Away From Securitizations.”) The most recent revision, published in December 2013, defines some securitisations as “type A” exposures, which are treated more favourably than other securitisations (“type B”). According to the study, the latest proposals show signs that European political leaders are becoming aware that securitisations are not all alike and that the disastrous performance of transactions related to the US sub-prime market were rather the exception. “Most European asset classes eligible for securitiesation have very good returns over the six years since the sub-prime crisis broke out in the United States,” says Mark Boyce, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor’s.
