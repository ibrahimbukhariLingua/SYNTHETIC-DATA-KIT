Petercam signs United Nations Principles for Responsible Investments


The Belgian asset management firm Petercam Institutional Asset Management (about EUR15bn in assets), which has recently received an SRI label from Novethic for its two flagship SRI funds, Petercam Equities Europe Sustainable and Petercam L Bonds Government Sustainable, on 30 September announced that they have signed the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN-PRI).Hugo Lasat, partner and head of institutional asset management, has announced that in addition to its in-house screening system for government bonds, the Belgian asset management firm has also recently developed its exclusive best-in-class SRI/ESG selection process (see Newsmanagers of 17 June and 7 September). The model is based on exclusion and ratings of businesses on the basis of quantitative SRI and ESG (environmental, social and governance) data, with differentiation by sector.On the basis of ESG elements which are decisive in determining the ESG performance of a business in a given sector, Petercam has defined six key ESG performance indicators for each sector. The overall rating combines six general SRI indicators, four corporate governance indicators, and the six key ESG performance indicators. By defining key ESG and SRI indicators for each sector, Petercam has combined an Anglo-American approach which considers ESG data in order to detect advantages in risk/return profiles, with a best-in-class SRI approach which more closely monitors the social values of various stakeholders.
