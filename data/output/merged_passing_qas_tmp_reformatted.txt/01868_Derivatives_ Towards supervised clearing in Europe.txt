Derivatives: Towards supervised clearing in Europe


Les Echos reports that in a draft communication to be passed this week, the EU government is planning to subject clearing houses, which the major market actors have agreed to set up, to a European system of supervision, which the Union is in the process of creating following the recommendations of the Larosière report. The EU is proposing to be in full supervision of their activities by mid-2010. They will be required to obtain licenses from a future European market authority to conduct business in the European Union. They will then be supervised, with the support of the European body, by national regulatory authorities. To incite banks to use centralised clearing houses, the Commission will require that clearing pass through such chambers for standardised derivatives. Owners’ equity requirements will also be raised for operations which will continue to be cleared on a bilateral basis.
