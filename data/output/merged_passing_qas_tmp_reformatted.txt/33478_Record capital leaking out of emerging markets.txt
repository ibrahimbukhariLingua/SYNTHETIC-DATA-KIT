They have exceeded the volume of aid and foreign investment in these countries, according to a report by the US NGO Global Financial Integrity (GFI), which reviewed illiticit capital flows from 151 countries. In 2012, these capital flows reached USD991.2bn, according to the most recent available data. They peaked at EUR6.6trn between 2003 and 2012, the report from the US NGO, entitled “Illicit financial flows from developing countries: 2003-2012,” indicates. “These capital flows, which already exceed the cumulative total of foreign direct investment and official development aid, are depriving poor or low-income economies of more than USD1trn per year,” the chairman of the organisation, Raymond Baker, says. “That is about USD1trn that could have contributed to the growth of those economies by creating jobs,” he added. In the same period, the ranking of coutnries which have the largest leaks of capital place China at the top (USD1.250trn between 2003 and 2012, and USD250bn in the year 2012 alone), followed by Russia (USD973bn in 10 years) and Mexico (USD514bn in 10 years).
