Outflows from emerging markets equity funds top USD40bn


Emerging markets equities funds have seen another week of redemptions, according to the most recent estimates from EPFR Global. Since the beginning of the year, net outflows from these funds have totalled USD40.5bn.However, equities markets appear to be in a slightly less pessimistic phase than in the past few weeks. “Some balance seems to be developing between optimists and pessimists. And if you look at flows to ETFs, which are most immediately sensitive to changes in investors’ moods, optimists appear to be gaining the upper hand,” says the managing director of EPFR Global, Brad Durham.Outflows from equity funds as a whole nonetheless totalled USD1.37bn in the second week of October.
