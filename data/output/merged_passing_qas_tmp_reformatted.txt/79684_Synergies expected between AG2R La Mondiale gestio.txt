Synergies expected between AG2R La Mondiale gestion d’actifs and OFI AM


The AG2R La Mondiale gestion d’actifs and OFI AM groups are preferring to speak of an “operational structuring” to describe the synergies expected from their merger, particularly in asset management. Dedicated teams at AG2R La Mondiale Gestion d’actifs and OFI AM (in which Matmut controls a 26% stake) may work together to manage equities and funds, André Renaudin, CEO of AG2R La Mondiale Matmut, explained at a press conference on Tuesday, 22 January. In bond and real estate management, the social protection group AG2R La Mondiale will retain its scope of action with internal teams. “The members of the management board at the group will make proposals for the merger in all areas. AG2R La Mondiale has its own captive company for asset management, and OFI AM, in which Matmut is a shareholder, has developed an activity for third parties. The entities may coexist,” adds Nicolas Gomart, deputy CEO. The new AG2R La Mondiale Matmut group has EUR8bn in owners’ equity, with EUR122bn in assets in insurance and supplementary retirement, and regulatory solvency of over 200%.
