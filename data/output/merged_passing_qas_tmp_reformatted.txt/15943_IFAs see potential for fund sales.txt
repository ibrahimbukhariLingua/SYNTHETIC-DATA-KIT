IFAs see potential for fund sales


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } A survey conducted in January by YouGov Psychonomics AG on behalf of Frankfurter Fondsbank (FFB, EUR16.6bn in assets under administration), an affiliate of Fidelity, covering 1,199 independent financial advisers (IFAs), finds that 66% of professionals see the most potential for sales of traditional investment funds to their clients until the end of this year. Other products are considerably less popular with IFAs: 47% favour Riester retirement savings products, 42% vote for current accounts, 30% for unit-linked life insurance, 28% for ETFs, and 22% for savings accounts. In terms of asset classes, IFAs clearly prefer equities, and recommend Asian equities (70%), followed by European equities (65%), while African equities are more popular even than American shares, at 27% and 18%.
