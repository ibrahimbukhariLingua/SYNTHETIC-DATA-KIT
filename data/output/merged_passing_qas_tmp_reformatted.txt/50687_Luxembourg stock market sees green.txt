Luxembourg stock market sees green


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Luxembourg stock market is becoming the first in the world to create a platform dedicated entirely to green financial instruments. The new platform, “Luxembourg Green Exchange (LGX),” debuted on 27 September. Access is limited to issuers who meet strict eligibility criteria. The platform aims to “establish a new point of reference for the fast-evolving green securities market,” a statement says. “Issues of green securities have taken off since COP21. There is a real desire to change. The market has enormous potential, but this must go hand in hand with the interests of investors. By establishing strict standards for green securities, LGX aims to create an environment in which the market can develop. COP22 will concentrate on preparations to enact the Paris Accord. With LGX, we are offering a patform dedicated both to issuers and to investors.” LGX thus includes issuers who dedicate 100% of funds raised to green investments. The 114 green bonds already listed on the Luxembourg stock exchange for over USD45bn will be immediately listed. Among the strict eligibility criteria are a requirement for the issuer to clearly indicate during the application process that the security is green in nature. It is also required for funds to be used exclusively to finance projects which are 100% green, as described in the Green Bond Principles. The issuer is also required to provide both ex-ante analysis performed by an independent third party, and ex-post reports, an unprecedented requirement for global capital markets.
