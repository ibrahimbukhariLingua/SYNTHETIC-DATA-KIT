UBS pays out USD18bn in redemptions


Le Temps reports that the US market authority, the SEC, announced on 23 September that UBS had respected the requirements of the authority regarding its Auction Rate Securities (ARS), financial products which were described as safe, but which lost all of their value at the height of the crisis in February 2008. By the terms of the agreement with the SEC, UBS agreed to redeem USD18bn to clients who lost money on these products. This has now been achieved, and “nearly 100% of investors” have now received some compensation, the SEC notes. The agency will therefore not impose a fine on UBS.
