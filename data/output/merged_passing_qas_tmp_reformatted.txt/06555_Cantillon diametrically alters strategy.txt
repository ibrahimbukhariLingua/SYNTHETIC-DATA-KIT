Cantillon diametrically alters strategy


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } The hedge fund management firm Cantillon Capital Management, founded in 2003 by William von Mueffling, formerly of Lazard Asset Management, attained USD10bn in assets due to the success of its policy of short-selling, the Wall Street Journal reports. But in June, Cantillon closed its hedge funds and redeemed USD3.5bn to subscribers, retaining only USD1bn in long-only assets. Since then, Cantillon has managed to attract investments from US and foreign pension funds and sovereign funds through returns of 21% since the beginning of the year, and assets now total over USD5bn. Subscribers were won over by the additional fact that Cantillon charges only 1.25% maximal management commissions, and no performance commissions. But von Mueffling says that he is considering limiting assets in the Cantillon Global Equity fund to USD7.5bn.
