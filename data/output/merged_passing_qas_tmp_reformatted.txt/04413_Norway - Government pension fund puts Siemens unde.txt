Norway - Government pension fund puts Siemens under surveillance


Kristin Halvorsen, the Norwegian finance minister, has decided to place Siemens under observation due to systematic large-scale corruption practiced by the group over many years. This may lead to the firm being expelled from the portfolio of the Government Pension Fund - Global, formerly known as the Oil Fund.â€¯?Even so, Siemens is now in the eye of public opinion, and has begun rolling out a series of anti-corruption measures. Putting the firm under observation will allow the Fund to maintain pressure to incite the German group to continue its efforts in the fight against corruption,? the Norwegian minister stated.As of 31 December 2008, the Government Pension Fund - Global held NOK6.3bn in Siemens shares, which represent 1.34% of voting rights in the firm.
