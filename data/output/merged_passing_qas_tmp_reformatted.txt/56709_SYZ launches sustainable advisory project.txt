SYZ launches sustainable advisory project


The Advisory of Banque Syz has launched a new bond product issued by the World Bank (IBRD) and linked to a basket of developed market stocks that meet SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) criteria. In partnership with the World Bank (IBRD), Banque Syz is the sole distributor of the note, the first bonds in Switzerland that directly link private investors to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Returns are linked to the performance of companies advancing the global development priorities set out in the goals, including addressing climate change, ending poverty, advancing gender equality, improving health and building sustainable infrastructure. Syz is the first private bank in Switzerland to offer this type of investment to private clients. While ESG (Environment Social Governance) focused solutions are available, the partnership with the World Bank goes beyond these solutions by focusing on the SDGs, which are sanctioned by the United Nations and will govern the UNâ€™s global strategy until 2030. In addition, all investments will be used to finance World Bank development projects.
