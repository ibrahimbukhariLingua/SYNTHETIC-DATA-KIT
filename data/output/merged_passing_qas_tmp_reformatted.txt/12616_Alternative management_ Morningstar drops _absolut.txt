Alternative management: Morningstar drops “absolute returns” and adds new categories


The independent financial analysis provider Morningstar announced on 30 August that it has created 18 new categories in order to better categorise alternative management funds which comply with UCITS requirements. “The new Morningstar categories for hedge funds represent a significant modernisation for the Morningstar categorisation for open-ended funds that use alternative investment strategies. It gives investors a clear description of the strategies deployed by managers,” a statement from Morningstar says.In particular, the new classifications are abandoning the term “absolute returns,” the statement says. According to Christopher Traulsen, CFA, director of fund research for Europe and Asia at Morningstar, “Absolute Returns had become too closely associated with a wider marketing term in the industry which made promises of returns that often failed to come true. In order to make our categories more useful and more transparent for investors, we have revised our classification system to better categorise alternative management funds according to their investment strategy.”The underlying portfolio and exposure to risk are the major factors to determine the category. Then, geographical region, asset class and specific investment strategies may be even more finely subdivided. For example, the strategies “Alt – Debt Arbitrage,” “Alt – Global Macro,” “Alt – Market Neutral – Equities,” and “Alt – Volatility” now represent specific categories.The former categories “Absolute Returns Euro, Absolute Returns Non-Euro and Long/Short” are being dropped, and will be replaced by the following more detailed classifications:Alt – Debt ArbitrageAlt – Diversified ArbitrageAlt – CurrenciesAlt – Event DrivenAlt – Funds of Funds – EquitiesAlt – Funds of Funds – OtherAlt – Funds of Funds – MultistrategyAlt – Global MacroAlt – Long/Short Equities – EuropeAlt – Long/Short Equities – InternationalAlt – Long/Short Equities – Emerging MarketsAlt – Long/Short Equities – UKAlt – Long/Short Equities – USAlt – Long/Short BondsAlt – Market Neutral – EquitiesAlt – MultistrategyAlt – Systematic FuturesAlt – VolatilityThe new categories will be used by Morningstar in Europe and Asia, and the classification system will also be used for hedge funds in the open-ended fund data base and for funds in the database dedicated to non-UCITS hedge funds. Investors will thus be more easily able to compare the two fund universes.Morningstar is making the new fund categories available on Morningstar Direct, the financial research and analysis software tool designed by Morningstar for professional investors, and also on its public website, http://www.agefi.fr/backoffice/scripts/www.morningstar.fr.
