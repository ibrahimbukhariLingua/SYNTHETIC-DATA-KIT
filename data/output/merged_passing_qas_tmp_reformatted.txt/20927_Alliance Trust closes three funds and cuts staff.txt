Alliance Trust closes three funds and cuts staff


The British firm Alliance Trust investments on 5 July unveiled a new approach to the management of its equity strategies, which will result in the closure of three funds and a parallel reduction in staff. The three funds concerned, out of a range which currently inludes seven products, are the UK Equity Income Fund, Asia-Pacific Equity Fund and Japan Equity Fund. Alliance Trust more than two years ago announced plans to refocus its activity on international equities and fixed income. In addition to a reduction in the range of funds, Alliance Trust has appointed Ilario Di Bon as head of equities.
