R Capital Management becomes Keensight


The historic hard core of private equity investment at the Rothschild group in Paris has chosen to go independent, Les Echos reports. The three partners who had made up R Capital Management for more than 10 years have renamed the structure “Keensight Capital.” “For several years, the Rothschidl group has invested in a completely integrated private equity platform. We have been offered either to join this firm, a 100% owned subsidiary of the group, or to become independent. We chose the entrepreneurial future,” explains Jean-Michel Beghin, one of the partners. Keensight Capital will not alter its strategy: allocate tickets of EUR5m to EUR30m to nich companies earning EUR10m to EUR150m in earnings and with strong growth.
