Université Dauphine seeking sponsors for chair in asset management and new technologies


The Université Dauphine in Paris is considering creating a new chair entitled “Asset management and new technologies,” NewsManagers has learnt. In an interview, Elyès Jouini, vice-chairman of the University, confirmed to NewsManagers that “for now we are in duscussions with potential sponsors and their list.” The launch date for the chair is therefore not yet set.“I think that new technologies are in the process of transforming, and will continue to profoundly transform all of the asset management professions: from robo-advisers to big data and artificial intelligence (AI), which will be increasingly used for financial and extra-financial analysis, to blockchain, which will transform asset custody,… And Dauphine with its House of Finance has a unique position in France in this area: a master’s degree in asset management created and managed in partnership with all of the major players in asset management, professional specialists on our teams of teachers and researchers in management and economics, specialists in big data, artificial intelligence, aggregation of recommendations, real-time processing of data flows with our mathematics and IT teams, which are recognized as among the best in the world (in the Shanghai top 30), and specialists in financial law at our Law Institute, since new technologies and their insertion into the various asset management professions will post important legal questions,” the professor explains.Jouini argues all of these questions should be addressed with an interdisciplinary approach, since methods, practices and the approval of market actors and the market will go hand-in-hand and feed one another mutually. “That is why we also mobilise sociologists, connoisseurs of the financial markets and of financial practices, to analyse the types of transformation and change in the industry and its players,” Jouini continues.
