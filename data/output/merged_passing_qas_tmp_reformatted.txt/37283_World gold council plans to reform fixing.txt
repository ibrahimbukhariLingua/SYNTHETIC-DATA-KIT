World gold council plans to reform fixing


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } The world gold council on 18 June announced plans to reform the daily fixing of the price of gold, which may change over to a method of calculation based on trades completed. The fixings of gold and silver prices have been subject to increased surveillance by regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe since the Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate) interbank lending rate fixing scandal last year. The WGC says in a staement that it will hold an initial meeting in London on 7 July with the various parties concerned – banks, refiners, central banks and mining companies – and, as an observer, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the British regulatory authority. “The fixing process was introduced nearly a centry ago, and so it is not surprising that it would need to be modified to meet the increased requirements of markets in terms of regulation, transparency and technology,” says Natalie Dempster, responsible for relationships with central banks and public policymakers at the WGC, cired in a statement. Fixing is now done twice per day by a group of banks who consult by telephone in order to establish a reference price, on the basis of trades between their clients. The WGC is proposing that the new fixing be set on the basis of transactions actually completed, and that it be an actual trading price, not merely a guide value.
