Liechtenstein toes the line on OECD criteria


Liechtenstein on 14 November announced that it would be coming into line on the criteria of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) concerning automatic exchange of information to combat tax fraud. In a statement, Liechtenstein has announced that it “will sign” the multilateral Convention concerning administrative assistance in matters of taxation in November 2013, which “shows its engagement in favour of fiscal cooperation based on widely shared international rules.” Liechtenstein also insists that “automatic exchange of information in tax matters will be the future international norm,” and proposes to “actively participate” with the OECD in talks on the subject.
