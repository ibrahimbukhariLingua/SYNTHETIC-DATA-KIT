Loys creates European version of Global MH hedge fund


Christoph Bruns, founder of the boutique Loys, based in Oldenburg, has decided to extend the client base for the German-registered hedge fund Loys Global MH by offering a UCITS-compliant version, the Loys Global L/S. The German-registered long/short equity product, which is also managed by Bruns, uses an absolute return strategy. It represents the missing link in the chain between the Loys Global, which is long-only, and the Loys Global MH. The fund was launched on 1 January 2012. Aside from its legal format, the difference between the global L/S and the global MH fund lies in the limits set for various positions (20% for the MH, and 5/10/40, i.e. up to 10% per position, with all positions of over 5% not permitted to exceed 40% of total assets, for the L/S). In addition, the Global L/S fund shorts via short-CFDs or swaps, while the Global MH uses securities lending and naked shorts.CharacteristicsName: Loys Global L/SISIN codesP shares (retail): LU0720541993I shares (institutional): LU0720542298Minimal subscriptionP shares: EUR2,500I shares: EUR500,000Management commission: P shares: 0,90% I shares: 0,75%Administration commission: 0.25%Performance commission: 15% with high watermark
