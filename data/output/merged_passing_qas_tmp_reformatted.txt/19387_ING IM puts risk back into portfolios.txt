ING IM puts risk back into portfolios


At a presentation in Paris, Patrick Moonen, senior equity strategist at ING Investment Management (ING IM), has emphasized that for asset allocation and absolute return portfolios (EUR30bn in assets), tactical asset allocation has been upated in the direction of higher risk.In other words, the Netherlands-based asset manager is currently preferring equities and real estate, whose valuations are attractive. In equities, Moonen prefers Europe to the United States, and has a neutral position on Japan. In the sectoral area, he is overweight in base materials, durable consumer products and financials, as well as value equities in general, which perform well at the beginning of economic recovery. In addition, ING IM is betting on “high dividend” strategies. However, telecommunications are on the list to underweight.Meanwhile, portfolios are underweight in commodities, since energies and agriculture represent 60% of indices, segments that are not popular with ING IM. Moonen says that although he is overweight in spread products, he is underexposed to government bonds.
