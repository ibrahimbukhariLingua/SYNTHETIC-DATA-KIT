Natixis AM unveils Seeyond expertise unit


A reshuffle at Natixis Asset Management announced in late March, orienting the firm to six areas of management expertise, is now being put into practice. The firm this morning unveils its volatility management and structured product expertise unit, entitled Seeyond.The team, which includes 32 members, and has EUR14.7bn in assets under management, includes structured management, flexible asset allocation, active volatility management, modelled equity management and long/short equities. The objective is to offer strategies which combine the search for returns and reduction of risk, a statement says.This is based on the idea that it is more efficient to exploit volatility in the markets to generate value. “Seeyond uses variability and dispersion in the markets to generate performance, and concentrates on risk management to construct portfolios which are adapted to the environment,” says Natixis AM. In the unit, the teams will also have a dedicated quantitative research unit, and “experts in the unit may regularly question the assumptions of classic financial theory, as well as their own models.”Concretely, Seeyond will develop a complete range of funds, in four areas of expertise: structuring and active protected management, modelled and optimised equities, flexible allocation and volatility, and equity arbitrage. The range from the unit will be available from the global distribution platform of Natixis Global Asset Management, and will be aimed at all investors, be they professional or not (institutional investors, corporates, multi-managers, private banks, IFAs and banking networks).Lastly, Emmanuel Bourdeix, who is co-CIO at Natixis Asset Management and a member of the executive board, has been appointed as head of the unit. Frank Trividic will join him as head of flexible allocation and volatility management. Nicolas Just, CFA, will be head of modelled and optimised equity management. Samir Naït Bachir is director of structured and protected active management, while Stéphane Galzy is head of equity arbitrage, and Hamza Bahaji is head of quantitative research.
