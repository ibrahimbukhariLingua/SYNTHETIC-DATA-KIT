Asset manager for Italian co-operative banks to be sold off


The De Agostini group is in exclusive talks with the Italian co-operative banks to take control of Arca Sgr, an asset management firm with assets of about EUR18bn, whose major shareholders include Banco Popolare (28%), Ubi Banca (23%), Bper (20.18%), Popolare Vicenza (10.92%), and Popolare di Sondrio (5.8%), Il Sole - 24 Ore reports. The potential buyer is negotiating to acquire a majority stake in the asset manager, but only on condition that it be allowed to retain a distribution agreement for Arca products via branches of the banks which would remain as minority shareholders. It is also asking for the co-operative banks to include their own asset management firms in the sale along with Arca.
