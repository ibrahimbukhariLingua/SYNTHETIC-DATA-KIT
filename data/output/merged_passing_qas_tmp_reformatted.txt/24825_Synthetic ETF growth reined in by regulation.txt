Synthetic ETF growth reined in by regulation


The exponential growth of the ETF Sector may be slowed in 2012. Recommendations which will very soon be published by the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) are expected to be rather strict, with the emphasis on counterparty risk and systemic risk controls, according to a study of the European market published recently by the research agency Celent. As a result, volumes under management in the synthetic ETF sector may decline, Celent estimates. Synthetic ETF fund creations were highly intensive between 2006 and 2010, a year when nearly 90% of releases of new synthetic products were in Europe (compared with 6% in the United States). The proportion of synthetic ETFs in the ETF market now represents 45% by value, compared with slightly over 20% in 2005. The synthetic ETF sector may begin to approach levels observed in the United States, where assets under management in the sector are lower due to regulatory restrictions. In Asia, where the market is just beginning, synthetic ETFs may play a major role in Hong Kong and Singapore, Celent predicts in another study dedicated to ETFs in Asia. But there again, regulations may have a lasting impact on the terrain. The Hong Kong market regulator (SFC) last year established rules to reduce counterparty and collateral risks, and to improve the transparency of synthetic products. Lyxor threatened to leave the market at that time. In Singapore, the regulator is planning to make changes to regulations similar to the European ones. If the modifications introduced are less rigorous than those put in place in Hong Kong, the Singapore market may overtake Hong Kong. Of the other Asian markets, Australia, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, investors prefer physical ETFs. In other words, volumes in physical ETFs may well continue to increase, but for synthetic ETFs, it is more likely that there will be stagnation or slight growth in the synthetic market, in both Asia and Europe.
