Swiss private banks may lose 7,000 jobs


About 7,000 jobs in Swiss private banking may be lost if European regulations aiming to improve market infrastructures go ahead as planned, Financial Times fund management reports. The Swiss banking association has warned that significant job losses are inevitable if proposals contained in the MiFID directive, which would require Swiss bankers to open branches or affiliates in the European Union to access onshore clients, are approved. Nicolas Faller, managing director of UBP, admits that the directive is “definitely a problem for small banks.” He says that it “will hurt profitability terribly.”
