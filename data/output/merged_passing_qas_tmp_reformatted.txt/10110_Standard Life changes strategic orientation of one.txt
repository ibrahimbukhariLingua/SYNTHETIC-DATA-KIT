Standard Life changes strategic orientation of one of its funds


More than 90% of shareholders have agreed at an extraordinary general meeting to convert the OEIC Managed Fund from Standard Life Investments (SLI) into a Global Equity Income Fund. The change will take effect on 16 January.The objective for the fund, managed by Kevin Troup, will be to generate income with potential for capital gains over the long term, rather than focusing on capital growth, as previously. In order to achieve that, the manager will construct a diversified international equity portfolio which combined the best ideas from SLI analysts and equity managers.The portfolio of 70-80 positions will be benchmarked against the development of the global income equity sector of the IMA.
