M&amp;G launches a multi-asset class fund with no benchmark


M&G Investments is launching the Global Dynamic Allocation Fund, which is not yet available in France, but which aims to generate positive returns in all market phases over a three-year period, through flexible management of a multi-asset class allocation (equities, government bonds, corporate bonds, convertibles, commodities, alternative assets, derivatives, currencies, cash, etc.) The product will be managed by George Tsinonis (head of the portfolio and risk strategy team at M&G since 2005), and has no benchmark index. It will be managed with strong conviction, and asset allocation will be based on macroeconomic outlooks as seen by the asset manager, through valuation of various asset classes, and active risk management in portfolio construction. The idea is to profit from several potential sources of performance. In periods of higher uncertainty on the markets, priority will be given to capital preservation. For the moment, the product is the only one in the M&G range to fall into the “multi assets funds” category. It comes as an addition to a rage of more traditional equities funds (18 products) and bond funds (3 products).
