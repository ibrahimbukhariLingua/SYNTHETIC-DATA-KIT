Netherlands nationalises DSB Bank


DSB Bank was Monday placed under the protection of the court in Amsterdam, AGEFI reports. “This outcome was inevitable,” the Finance minister declared on Monday, cited by the journal. He adds, “it is important to emphasize that the problems encountered by DSB Bank are not due to the financial crisis. This is a relatively small, independent bank, which encountered problems of governance, concerns on the part of clients, a lack of transparency in terms of communication, and ensuing uncertainty.”
