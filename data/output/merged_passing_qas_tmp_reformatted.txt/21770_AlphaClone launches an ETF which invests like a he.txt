AlphaClone launches an ETF which invests like a hedge fund


On 31 May, AlphaClone, with Exchange Traded Concepts (ETC), launched the AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETF (acronym ALFA) on the NYSE. The fund invests in US equities confirmed to be held by hedge fund managers. The objective is to capture alpha from the long positions of these asset managers, while protecting the portfolio against protracted downturns on the market via a dynamic hedging mechanism.The fund is derived from the hedge fund replication methodology developed by AlphaClone and its founder, Mazin Jadallah, on the basis of the AlphaClone Hedge Fund Long/Short Index, a passive, risk-managed index. It is the first ETF born of AlphaCloneâ€™s partnership with the options exchange International Securities Exchange (ISE).Unlike replications of the beta of hedge funds, the AlphaClone index directly selects the long positions of the fund on the basis of public notifications by hedge funds, using the Clone Score AlphaClone rankings system.ETC is the investment adviser for ALFA, while Knight Clearing Services is the lead market maker.
