Sustainable development fund for German foundations


Wilhelm von Finck Deutsche Family Office AG has launched a sustainable development institutional fund for German foundations (minimal subscription: EUR0.5m). The WvF Performance und Sicherheit fund includes “additional protection” of assets against sudden turbulence on the financial markets.This protection is generated through the use of risk management by the wealth management unit at Deutsche Bank. This results in an additional risk budget of 5% per year on a month-to-month rolling basis (which is not guaranteed). Allocation to bonds and money markets is expected to represent at least 70% of assets, while exposure to more volatile assets such as equities or themed funds will be more limited.Meanwhile, respect for environmental, social and ethical criteria is assured by the Munich-based firm oekom research.Investors seeking to subscribe to the fund in large volumes will have access to the investment committee and will pay a reduced front-end fee. Management commission is 0.65%.
