ETFs: positive qualities overshadowed by sterile controversies


After recently expressing regret at the unfounded accusations levelled at ETFs, Scott Ebner, global head of product development for SPDR ETF (State Street Global Advisors), has said that he is shocked by the recent discussions taking place about ETFs,, at a round table held in London. “There is inaccurate information [going around] which has obscured the genuinely positive qualities of ETFs and the reasons for their sustained growth rate,” he explained, pointing out that these products are “flexible tools, which bring immediate diversification into market segments which were previously prohibitive or difficult to access.” Separating out the merits of the physical replication method compared with synthetic replication is less important for investors than understanding how and why to use ETFs. Ebner also brushes off the notion that ETFs would have a destabilising effect on the markets. “In reality, there are about 2,000 ETFs on the market, which is not many compared with the number of funds in the Morningstar universe,” he says. In the debate, Justin Urquhart, director of marketing at the firm Seven Investment Management, claimed that the low cost of ETFs are a factor in their popularity. Steven Doran, a fund manager at HSBC Global Asset Management, welcomed the beneficial effects of ETFs on the markets, as they bring liquidity, particularly to sectors such as emerging markets. But the head also militated for increased efforts to educate investors. There is still some work to be done to make retail investors fully understand synthetic ETFs.
