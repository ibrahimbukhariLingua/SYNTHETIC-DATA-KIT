IFAs adapt their offerings to RDR regulations


The majority of British independent financial advisers (IFAs) will increase their use of model portfolios and funds categorised according to their risks, as a result of new RDR legislation, according to a study by Skandia Investment Group. The study finds that nearly two thirds (65%) of independent financial advisers are planning to increase their use of reference portfolios and that more than half of them (53%) are planning to increase their use of risk-categorised funds. The other solutions preferred by advisers include multi-asset class funds (44% of respondents) and multi-management funds (42%). Custom portfolios are mentioned by only 35% of advisers. Notably, 57% of advisers have no plans whatsoever to offer more inexpensive funds due to upcoming regulatory changes. Among the advisers who are considering these more inexpensive solutions, the option cited by two thirds of advisers (66%) is actively-managed low-cost funds, followed by passively-managed funds (51%). ETFs are being considered by only 19% of IFAs.
