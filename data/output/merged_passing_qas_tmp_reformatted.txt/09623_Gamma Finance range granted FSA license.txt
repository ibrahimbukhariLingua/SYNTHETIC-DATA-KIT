Gamma Finance range granted FSA license


In 2009, Florian de Sigy and Javier Rodriguez founded Gamma Finance, which has recently been granted a license by the FSA. The new entity will offer “innovative” services in the world of alternative investment. Thanks to a relatively wide client base, Gamma Finance is planning to create and supply markets and secondary transactions on shares in less liquid hedge funds, the firm’s website explains. The idea is to take advantage of sales of fund shares by investors seeking to reprofile their portfolios, or who have set up gates and side pockets. Previously, de Sigy was European Head of Structured Equity Sales at the Institutional Client Group of Deutsche Bank Global Markets in London, while Rodriguez was senior strategist and head of strategic accounts at the Client Solutions Group (CSG) of Barclays Global Investors (BGI).
