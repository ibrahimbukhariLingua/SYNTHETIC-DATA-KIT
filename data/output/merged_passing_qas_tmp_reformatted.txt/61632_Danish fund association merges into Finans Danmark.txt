Danish fund association merges into Finans Danmark


The Danish association of asset management professionals, Investeringsfondsbranchen (IFB), will merge with Finans Danmark, a larger sectoral association representing finance more broadly, a statement has announced. The objective is to have a stronger association, particularly in relation to the Danish authorities and the European authorities, in a context of toughening regulations. The IFB will be integrated in to Finans Danmark as part of a new unit to be entitled “Investering og opsparing” (investment and savings). Anders Klinkby will continue to head the IFB and the new unit. The IFB wil continue to be represented within EFAMA, the European investment fund association.
