Investment fund association calls for Swiss unity


Agefi Switzerland reports that the investment fund sector has not been spared from the bad news on the markets, but the Swiss Funds Association (SFA) pointed out on 13 January that there were no massive closures, and the number of products on sale actually increased last year. “Instead of focusing on foreign markets, we should be more aware of our strengths, and put our pragmatic regulatory approach in the foreground. If we join forces to provide access to the European market, our financial market will be attractive for major asset managers. Even though our infrastructure is not optimal, we will still attract managers. We therefore need to improve,” said the president of the association, Martin Thommen. The SFA is calling for an attenuation of the protectionist elements in the planned AIFM directive, so as to make it possible for managers domiciled in Switzerland to receive European passports.
