Kneip buys 3i out of its capital


The Luxembourg-based provider of services to the asset management sector Kneip announced on 24 June that it has acquired the entirety of the 3i groupâ€™s stake in its capital from 3i. The firm, which has about 150 employees, says in a statement that its strong international growth in the past three years has allowed it to finance the operation. 3i acquired a large minority stake in the capital of Kneip in May 2007, to help the firm to extend its range of services and develop internationally. Since then, Kneip has opened offices in London and Paris, and has made three acquisitions, including La Cote Bleue in Paris last year. Kneip serves major actors in the management industry, with assets under management of nearly EUR1.8trn.
