Europe - More banks to sell asset management activities


More than 70% of asset managers interviewed by Ignites Europe think that the European asset management industry will need to consolidate in 2009. Like Credit Suisse, other major banks will decide to sell a majority proportion of their asset management businesses, predicts Frédéric Jolly, former chief operating officer for EMEA at Russell Investments, who has recently founded a private equity firm specialised in asset management acquisitions. The result may be the creation of a pan-European giant in asset management, Ignites suggests.
