Net redemptions from Asian hedge funds


After two consecutive quarters of net inflows, Asian hedge funds in January-March saw net outflows of about USD700m in first quarter, according to an estimate by Hedge Fund Research (HFR), which attributes this development to uncertainty related to strategic and regulatory risks. However, net outflows were more than offset by positive market effects of USD1.5bn, meaning that hedge funds focused on Asia had assets as of the end of March of USD77.15bn (compared with USD76.34bn three months earlier), and the number of funds had decreased slightly, to 1,036 (compared with 1,039), of which 19.35%, compared with 23.73%, are based in the United Kingdom, and 26.88%, compared with 24.52%, are domiciled in the United States. Though net outflows were modest, they are poor compared with global developments, as hedge funds have seen net inflows overall of USD13.7bn.
