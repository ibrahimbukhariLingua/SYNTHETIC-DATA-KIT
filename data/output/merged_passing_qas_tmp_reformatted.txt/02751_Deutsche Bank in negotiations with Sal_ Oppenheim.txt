Deutsche Bank in negotiations with Sal. Oppenheim


In a statement on Wednesday, Deutsche Bank confirmed that it is in discussions with the Sal. Oppenheim bank over a “strategic partnership,” by which the German bank has made a non-binding offer to acquire a stake in the capital of the Luxembourg bank, which would allow it to undertake due diligence on its accounts. The statement adds that the strategic partnership would enhance Sal. Oppenheim clients’ access to the Deutsche Bank international network, and would strengthen the position of the German bank in private management activities, particularly in Germany.
