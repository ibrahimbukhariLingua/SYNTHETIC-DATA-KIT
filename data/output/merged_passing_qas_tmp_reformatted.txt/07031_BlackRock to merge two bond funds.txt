BlackRock to merge two bond funds


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } An extraordinary meeting of shareholders in the Government Securities fund from BlackRock will be held on 13 October. Shareholders in the fund, with only GBP43m in assets, will vote on a proposition to be merged into the tracker fund UK Gilts All Stocks Tracker (GBP680m, TER of 0.45%). The Government Securities fund (which charges 1%) does not have sufficient size to allow for effective and profitable operation.
