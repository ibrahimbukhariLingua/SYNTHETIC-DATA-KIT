Charles Stanley issues its second profit warning in five months


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Less than five months after first profit warning (see Newsmanagers of 17 April), the British asset management firm Charles Stanley has issued second warning about its upcoming profits. In April, Charles Stanley warned that its annual profits for the fiscal year ending on 31 March 2014 “would probably be more than 10% lower than market expectations,” due to one-time costs related in part to regulatory changes in the United Kingdom following the introduction of the Retail Distribution Review (RDR) and a decline in commission revenues. At the conclusion of its 2013-2014 fiscal year, ending on 31 March 2014, the British asset management firm finally saw a 33% decline in its pre-tax profits. Charles Stanley has announced the same trading pattern has persisted through July and August with low transaction volumes resulting in depressed commission income. As a result, the firm estimates that its upcoming figures will be “materially below expectations” once again.
