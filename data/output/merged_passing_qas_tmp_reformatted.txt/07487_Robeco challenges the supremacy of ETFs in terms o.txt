Robeco challenges the supremacy of ETFs in terms of cost and performance


ETFs claim to be inexpensive and to achieve returns approaching those of their benchmarks. However, Patrick Howeling, senior quantitative researcher at Robeco, has shown on the basis of comparison of a “relevant” sample of ETFs in high yield segments (3 funds) and investment grade corporate bonds (20 funds) that these funds have characteristics highly similar to those of actively-managed funds in terms of performance, tracking error and fee structure. The study covered the period from March 2007 to March 2010. For example, the total expense ratio (TER) for high yield ETF funds totalled 40-50 basis points, while Robeco charges 57 basis points to institutionals, and 116 basis points to retail investors, for its High Yield Bonds fund. In the investment grade segment, the TER for ETF funds was between 15 and 20 basis points, while according to Morningstar, actively-managed funds charge an average of 49 basis points to institutionals and 117 basis points to retail investors. Houweling points out that the higher cost of active management should be expected to be compensated for by higher performance. In the case of the Robeco High Yield Bonds fund, the annual net outperformance was 100 basis points for retail investors in the period under review, while the ETF High Yield funds saw a total annual net underperformance of 250 to 600 basis points. The tracking error for high yield ETFs ranged from 7.3% to 12%, while the Robeco High Yield Bonds fund had a tracking error of only 6.3%. In the investment grade segment, tracking error for ETFs launched before 2009 totalled 2.33%.
