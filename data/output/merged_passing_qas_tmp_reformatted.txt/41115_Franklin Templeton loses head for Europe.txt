p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Jamie Hammond, managing director for Europe at Franklin Templeton Investments, will be leaving the asset management firm after 15 years of good and loyal service, Financial News reports. According to a statement from the firm, Hammond will remain in his position until 6 January to “ensure a smooth transition.” Hammond, who has been head of the European activity at Franklin Templeton since August 2010, has seen assets under management in Europe increase from USD57.7bn to over USD100bn. He also oversaw the acquisition of the British company Rensburg Asset Management, then an affiliate of Investec, for GBP45m in January 2011. Before serving as managing director for Europe, Hammond served as senior director for the United Kingdom and Northern Europe. Before joining Franklin Templeton in 2000, he worked for nearly four years at Hill Samuel Asset Management, a firm acquired in 2000 by Scottish Widows Investment Management to create Scottish Widows Investment Partnership. According to Financial News, citing a source familiar with the matter, Hammond is reportedly in talks to take up a senior position at AllianceBernstein. When contacted by the British website, the US asset management firm declined to comment on the reports.
