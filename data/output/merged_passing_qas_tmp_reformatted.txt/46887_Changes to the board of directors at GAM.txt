The director explains that is departure was ordained by his employer, Julius Baer, which will no longer permit him to sit on the board of directors, the asset management firm announced on 20 March. Enkelmann had been director at GAM since 2009. The group has no plans to appoint a successor at the next general shareholders’ meeting, a statement says. A new member will be found, who will be inducted by the 2016 general shareholders’ meeting at the latest.
