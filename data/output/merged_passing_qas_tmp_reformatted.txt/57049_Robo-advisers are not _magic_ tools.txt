Robo-advisers are not “magic” tools


The index provider Solactive has released a study of robo-adviers, entitled “Robo-Advisory: A closer look at the engine room,” which considers a series of issues related to the ongoing growth of these new toold, including questions related to transparency, track records and asset allocation. Wth this in mind, Solactive has compared US and German robo-advisers.The study finds that robo-advisers use various optimisation approaches as a basis of determine the recommended portfolios, and there are significant differences between the US and German vehicles, particularly concerning allocation and fees. Lastly, it seems that robo-advisers are not “magical” tools, and that even these tools may cause losses, even as part of the implementation of conservative investment strategies. Tim Pfeiffer, head of research and development at Solactive, estimates in conclusion that robo-advisers represent a real challenge to traditional assets, but that they are not going to become the only apporach to investment either. These tools are “certainly a good service to supplement traditional offerings. Try to think more this way: even 20 years after the first packages were sent by Amazon, there are still libraries, I even imagine that libraries have improved. In the same way, there will still be personalised banking and investment services in 20 years. Banks can create hybrid models, particularly based on individual investment objectives, auch as retirement planning or life events. This is an area in which online planning is still facing limitations,” Pfeiffer writes.
