Strategists sceptical of potential effectiveness of EFSF


A quarterly survey by Financial Times Deutschland of the major asset management firms has found that a majority of strategists are doubtful of the effectiveness of the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF). For example, Kurt Schappelwein (Raiffeisen Capital Management) claims that the EFSF does not solve any of the fundamental problems, while Stefan Rondorf (Allianz GI) says that it lacks the dissuasive capacity that would allow it to intervene on the necessary scale in the Italian or Spanish bond markets.For fourth quarter, strategists recommend a positioning on defensive shares such as equities in the health and food sectors. On the other hand, banking sector shares which appear to be directly affected by the debt crisis in peripheral European countries figure at the bottom of the list of recommendations.
