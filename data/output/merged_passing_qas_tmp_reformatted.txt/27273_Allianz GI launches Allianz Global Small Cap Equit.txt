Allianz GI launches Allianz Global Small Cap Equity fund in France


Allianz Global Investors (AllianzGI) has announced the launch of the Allianz Global Small Cap Equity fund in France, for both institutional and retail investors. The fund aims to attract long-term capital growth and to outperform the MSCI World Small Cap Total Return index. The portfolio includes four allocations dedicated to geographical regions (North America, Europe, Japan and Asia), with each zone having the same weighting as the index. The principal manager, Andrew Neville, will aim to regain a neutral geographical allocation, adjusting the four underlying security selection strategies. The Global Small Cap portfolio reflects the best ideas of the four Small Cap portfolios from Allianz Global Investors. The fund invests in nearly 190 small businesses selected by local experts for their attractive risk/return profile. It privileges capitalisations of at least USD400m. AllianzGI has been managing Small Cap funds for 14 years in Japan, for 15 years in Asia Pacific and for 30 years in the United States. The fund is registered in several European markets: Austria, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. It is domiciled in Luxembourg.
