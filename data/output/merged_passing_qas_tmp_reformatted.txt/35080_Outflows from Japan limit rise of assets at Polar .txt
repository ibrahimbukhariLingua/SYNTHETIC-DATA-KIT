Outflows from Japan limit rise of assets at Polar Capital


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } Assets under management at Polar Capital rose by only 1% in the six months to the end of September, to a total of USD13.4bn. Due to the strong rise seen in the previous six months, assets are up by more than 17% over 12 months. However, in the six months to the end of September, the growth in assets was slowed by net redemptions of USD425m from long-only products, which outflows were largely due to redemptions from Japanese equity UCITS funds, after very strong growth in asstes under management. The good performance of the markets, however, brought in USD549m for long-only products. Alternative funds posted flat returns, but inflows of USD117m in the period.
