Socially responsible investment gaining points


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } In the next two to three years, more than half of asset managers who offer socially responsible investment products are predicting strong demand from charities (56%) and high net worth investors (52%), according to a survey carried out by Cerulli Associates in partnership with US SIF. In addition, studies of consultants undertaken by Cerulli indicate that more than half of consultants surveyed (52%) evaluate, and in some cases recommend these impact investments to their private and institutional clients. The impact investing brand remains relatively undeveloped. In its 2016 survey of alternative investments, Cerulli states that only 14% of institutional asset managers stated that they managed impact investment funds.
