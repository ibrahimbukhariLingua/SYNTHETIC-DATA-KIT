Schelcher Prince Gestion tops EUR3.5bn in assets


Schelcher Prince Gestion, an asset management firm specialised in fixed income, credit and convertible bonds, in which Federal Finance controls 85%, has topped EUR3.5bn in assets, due to net inflows of nearly EUR750m since the beginning of the year (as of 30 September).Most inflows, EUR500m, went to funds, which are more lucrative than mandates and dedicated funds, says Sébastien Barbe, CEO of the asset management firm, in an interview with Newsmangers.The other remarkable fact of the year is the development of Schelcher Prince Gestion serving a new class of clients: distribution and independent financial advisers, which got a boost last year with the recruitment of Fabrice Neyroumande.In order to win over these clients, the French asset management firm has overhauled its Opportunités Européennes fund, and converted it into a wealth management fund based on 11 strategies from the group, including the house specialties: convertible bonds, high yield, investment grade, etc.The product, managed by Fabien Labrousse and Barbe, now has assets of EUR180m, compared with EUR38m as of the end of 2012. “It is seeing inflows at a pace of EUR15m per month, whereas we had EUR5m at first,” adds Neyroumande, head of distribution, who has recently been assisted by Etienne Laluque from Federal Finance.As a result of this development, distribution clients represent 15% of assets at Schelcher Prince Gestion, compared with 85% for institutional investors, half of which are composed of retirement assets. Internationally, Schelcher Prince is continuing to build its network, particularly in Southern and Northern Europe. In the latter region, the firm is partnered with the Swedish bank SEB. Other vectors are in progress to develop in these countries and beyond the borders of Europe, says Bruno Promonet, deputy CEO and head of business development.In terms of asset classes, the firm has consolidated its convertible bond unit, which now represents EUR1.2bn, of which more than EUR800m are in open-ended funds. A mandate and a dedicated fund are expected to be released soon, with an overall total ofEUR70m. The firm is also betting on its global fund.The short term has also worked well, with the unexpected arrival of a corporate client. The fund dedicated to this asset class now has EUR750m in assets, and will very soon reach EUR1bn. But in light of the volatility of corporated, Schelcher Prince Gestion does not want to “push” the product too hard.The high yield unit, for its part, has EUR60m, with a fund of EUR180m.Lastly, in the future, these areas may be joined by operations in the area of loans.
