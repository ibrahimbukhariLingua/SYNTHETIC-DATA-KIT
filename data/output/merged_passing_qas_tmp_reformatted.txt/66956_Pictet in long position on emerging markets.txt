Pictet in long position on emerging markets


“ We have recently adopted a long position on emerging markets,” F rédéric Rollin, investment strategy adviser at Pictet in Paris, has announced at a press conference. The decision was taken in mid-August, in the middle of the Turkish crisis, and concerns emerging market equities and debt. “ I feel the crisis in emerging markets is related to the rise of the US dollar, and the pressure that exercises on accounts in deficit, as well as to fears about Chinese growth,” says Rollin. Pictet is predicting both a stabilization of the dollar and a rebound in China. “ In China, we have very strong advanced indicators. The Chinese central bank has a very accommodating monetary policy. It has massively injected cash.” Concerning the trade war, Rollin admits that China is focusing its attention, but several factors can be expected to offset negative effects, including a rebound in spending on infrastructure and rising taxes. In Turkey and for Turkish assets, the firm remains prudent. Rollen expresses a preference for Asia and Russia. However, he has revised outlooks for Latin America down.
