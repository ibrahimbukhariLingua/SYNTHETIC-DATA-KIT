Finaltis acquires two managers and a fund from Fourpoints


The French asset management firm Finaltis, which has over EUR300m in assets under management, has brought on board Benoît Flamant and Leslie Griffe from Malval, along with the fund they have been managing since 2008 at Fourpoints, Fourpoints Funds Digital Leaders, with assets of EUR30m.The boutique is taking over the entire Luxembourg Sicav Fourpoints Funds, which will be renamed as Finaltis Funds, though it has only one sub-fund.The Digital Leaders fund is invested exclusively in publicly-traded equities in global companies “at the core of the digital transition and the ditigalization of the economy,” a statement says. The approach is based on a selection of publicly-traded businesses whose growth is driven directly by the digital transition, far beyond tech stocks alone. “The fund has been repositioned with an investment universe centered on the ditigal theme and no longer on the tech sector, and our ambition is to build up to EUR100m as fast as possible as a first step,” Thierry Rigoulet, a partner at Finaltis in charge of development, tells Newsmanagers.“The objective for this operation is to strengthen our presence in equity management, which is our core profession. Our logic is to combine the experience and expertise of Benoît and Leslie in digital with our historic expertise (analysis and data platform, portfolio construction and dynamic risk controlling,)” says Rigoulet. Finaltis, founded in 2001 with the theme of alternative management, repositioned itself in the years following 2011 in equity management, while retaining its quantitative DNA. “Our ambition is to continue to develop in equity management with an Active Premium Investing (API) philosophy, working with the traditional risk premia (volatility, Titans, Digital Leaders, etc.,)” Rigoulet concludes.
