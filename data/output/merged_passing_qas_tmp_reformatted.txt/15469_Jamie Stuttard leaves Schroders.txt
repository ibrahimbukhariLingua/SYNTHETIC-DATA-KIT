Jamie Stuttard leaves Schroders


Jamie Stuttard is leaving Schroders «to pursue other opportunities». Following this departure, the fund management company announces that Philippe Lespinard, fixed income chief investment officer and also lead manager of the Global Multi-Strategy team, will take over responsibility for the UK and Euro Aggregate portfolios, that is to say the Schroder ISF Euro Short Term Bond, the Schroder ISF Euro Bond, the Schroder Special Situations Fund Sterling Broad Market Libor and the Schroder Institutional Sterling Broad Market. Wes Sparks, head of US Fixed Income, continues as co-fund manager for Global Credit portfolios (Schroder ISF Global Credit Duration Hedged and Schroder ISF Global Corporate Bond) but his remit has expanded beyond his current focus on the US component of the strategy to include the asset allocation process for the broader strategy.
