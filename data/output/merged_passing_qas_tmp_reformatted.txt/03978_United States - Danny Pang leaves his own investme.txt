United States - Danny Pang leaves his own investment firm


The Californian manager Danny Pang has temporarily quit working for his investment company, Private Equity Management Group, which is reported to manage assets of USD4bn, after an investigation of him was initiated by the authorities, the Wall Street Journal reports. The newspaper published an article by PEMGroup this week, revealing that Pangâ€™s university degrees and his experience at Morgan Stanley could not be verified. Some suggest that the firm is involved in a Ponzi scheme.
