From USD13.77bn as of the end of 2011, the US bond management firm Muzinich & Co has increased its assets to USD19.5bn as of the end of September, including USD10.6bn for its UCITS-compliant funds, which posted net inflows of USD3.5bn in the first nine months of the year. According to the local MD, Eric Pictet, the Paris office contributed more than USD1bn to these net subscriptions.In general, 90% to 92% of assets at the group come from European clients.More than half of inflows this year have been for the Short Duration High Yield fund, launched on 4 October 2010, which has USD5.1bn in assets, and alone has attracted USD2.5bn in net new money, the manager, David Bowen, has explained at a presentation in Paris.Currently, the portfolio of the fund includes 170 holdings and 135 issuers, with a an average duration to worst (DTW) of 1.3 years (the average DTW for the high yield market is closer to 3.8 years). The fund thus, with a sacrifice of 1.5 percentage points in return, shortens duration by 2 1/2 years.
