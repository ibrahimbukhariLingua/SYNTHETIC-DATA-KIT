Robert Michele plans to double exposure to emerging market debt


Robert Michele, who since October 2008 has been director of fixed income management at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in London, is planning to double the firmâ€™s exposure to emerging market corporate debt by the end of the year, according to Investment Week. Michele, manager of the Strategic Bond Fund (GBP52.4m), says that the current weighting of 10% could rise to 20% or 25%. The fund currently holds government debt from Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Israel, Turkey, and Egypt, but Michele would like to add corporate debt from Latin America and Asia.
