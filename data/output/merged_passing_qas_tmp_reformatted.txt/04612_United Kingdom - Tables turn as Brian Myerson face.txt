United Kingdom - Tables turn as Brian Myerson faces shareholder revolt


Brian Myerson, known for his shareholder activism, is facing a revolt on the part of shareholders in his own Principle Capital Investment Trust, who are seeking to unseat him and three other directors, sell off the shares, and redistribute the money to shareholders, the Sunday Times reports. The revolt is being led by the United States hedge fund QVT, which is dissatisfied with the poor performance of Principle, and also has the allegiance of the investment fund EIM, managed by Arki Busson, and of Invesco. At a general assembly on 26 March, they will propose that Crystel Amber Management be designated to sell off the fundâ€™s investments over a two-year period.
