Despite their advantages, ETFs are not being used optimally


In its most recent study, State Street Corporation considered exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the use which institutional investors make of them. Due to a variety of factors related to economic uncertainties, the volatility of the markets and investorsâ€™ desire to pay reasonable management fees, these exchange-traded funds are rapidly gaining popularity, as they provide exposure to a variety of assets classes at low cost. However, according to the study, institutional investors are not fully taking advantage of the flexibility offered by these investment tools, which currently represent nearly USD1trn in assets under management. The study also points out differences in the development of ETF markets worldwide and recent regulatory changes. The study of ETFs may be consulted at www.statestreet.com/vision.
