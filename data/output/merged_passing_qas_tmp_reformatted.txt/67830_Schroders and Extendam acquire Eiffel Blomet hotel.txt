Schroders and Extendam acquire Eiffel Blomet hotel in Paris


The independent asset management firm Extendam and Schroder Real Estate Hotels, the division of Schroder Real Estate formed following the acquisition of Algonquin Management Partners, will on 26 July announce the acquisition of the Art Deco style Eiffel Blomet hotel, which has recently been reopened. This is the second acquisition in Paris for Schroder Real Estate Hotels since the arrival of Algonquin in the real estate sector.The Eiffel Blomet hotel is a four-star hotel with 87 rooms, located at 78 rue Blomet in Paris. The hotel opened in June 2017, after 18 months of repositioning work. “This rare property in the centre of the capital, located near the Parc des Expositions de la Porte de Versailles and the business district on the left bank in Paris, has critical size and an inventory of rooms that will allow it to maximise its management yield and to minimise its costs,” Extendam and Schroder Real Estate Hotels say in a joint statement.Schroder Real Estate Hotels is the designated manager of the hotel, and is currently in talks with several operators to contract for management of the hotel via a franchise contract.
