EdRAM duo launch consulting firm


As Newsmanagers reported last week, Philippe Couvrecelle has officially launched PTH-Conseil, his own asset management consulting firm. The former chairman of the board of Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (EdRAM) will collaborate with Jean Maunoury, previously head of strategy and a fund of funds manager at EdRAM. In practice, PTH-Conseil, the announcement of whose launch coincides with that of the 2013-2016 strategic plan at La Compagnie Financière Edmond de Rothschild (see elsewhere in Newsmanagers), «will provide strategic guidance to both local and global asset managers, with a particular emphasis on European, American and Asian markets. In light of the challenges and changes facing the asset management industry, they are poised to step in with a differentiated approach to help companies to re-think and re-shape their business architecture,» a statement says.
