Switzerland - 43.3% of pension funds have less than 100% coverage


According to an estimate by the Swiss federal social insurance office (OFAS), covering about 1,900 retirement planning institutions, 56.7% of second pillar retirement support pension funds showed a decrease in their coverage rates at the end of March, while 17.8% had coverage of less than 100%. These totals compare with 50.1% and 13.5% as of 31 December 2008. In other words, despite the falling securities markets in 2008 and early 2009, 43.3% of pension funds had a coverage rate of at least 100%, compared with 49.9% three months earlier, while 16%, compared with 18%, had 110% coverage or higher.
