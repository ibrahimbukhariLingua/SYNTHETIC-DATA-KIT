Discretionary mandates add up to over CHF1.2trn


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Assets under management in Switzerland in the form of discretionary mandates totalled EUR1.240trn as of the end of 2015, including EUR820m coming from businesses and institutions, according to a survey released on 7 September by the Swiss Fund and Asset Management Association (SFAMA) and Boston Consulting Group (BCG). Firms which participated in the survey also indicated that they manage foreign collective capital investments in Switzerland totalling CHF320bn. In addition to this comes over CHF700bn invested in Swiss collective capital investments. “One can thus conclude that the total amount in management in the Swiss market in these two groups of products represents well over CHF2trn,” a statement says. These figures put the Swiss financial industry in “a leading position” in Europe, SFAMA notes. It points out that there had previously been no statistics of this type for the asset management sector, particularly statistics concerning discretionary mandates. Hence the reason for conducting a survey of Swiss market actors. “This approach differs fundamentally from conventional statistics from the Swiss national bank, reflecting wealth in securities accounted in Switzerland, or to statistics concerning household savings from Swiss Fund Data and Morningstar, which place the emphasis on the volume of sales in Switzerland, or on the legal domicile of the fund,” explains Daniel Kessler, managing partner at the Boston Consulting Group Switzerland, in a statement.
