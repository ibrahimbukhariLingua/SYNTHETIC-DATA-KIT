Madoff: Ezra Merkin to pay USD410m


J. Ezra Merkin, former chairman of GMAC Financial Services, has agreed to pay USD410m to settle a lawsuit filed by the New York attorney general, accusing him of channeling billions of dollars belonging to his clients, without their knowledge, to the business of Bernard Madoff, via Merkinâ€™s firm, Gabriel Capital Corp, the Wall Street Journal reports. The settlement does not apply to a lawsuit filed by Irving Picard, court-appointed trustee for the business interests of Madoff.
