Launching of the «Europlace Factbook»


Paris EUROPLACE announced yesterday the launch of the Paris financial market Factbook, openly available through the Paris Europlace website: www.paris-europlace.com . Following recommendations from the Haut Comité de Place (Paris Financial Services High-Level Committee), the «EUROPLACE Factbook» aims to make available to both European and international professionals – issuers, investors, banks, financial intermediaries, market authorities, etc. – key data concerning the activities of both the Paris financial market and other major European markets. It will thus provide a follow up tool of the Paris marketplace’s competitiveness serving the real economy in Europe. This statistical tool was put together with the support of Banque de France and the contribution of the leading professional associations of the Paris marketplace, AFG (French Asset Management Association), FBF (French Banking Federation), AFIC (French Association of Investors in Growth), FFSA (French Federation of Insurance Companies). The «EUROPLACE Factbook» will be monitored by a Steering Committee, which will regularly update the main new trends of the Paris Financial marketplace and its environment.
