BlackRock was the most popular fund distributor in March in the European market, with net inflows of €6.28bn, followed by Pimco (€3.73bn) and Robeco (€2.89bn), according to statistics from the Lipper team at Refinitiv. They are followed by State Street (€2.18bn) and Axa (€1.79bn), the only French firm among the top 10. Analysts report that inflows at BlackRock were driven by money market products, which represented €4.4bn in (out of €6.28bn). Following on previous months, March brought net outflows of €18.8bn from long-term funds (excluding money market funds).

Real estate funds finished out the month in positive territory, with a positive balance of only €0.1bn, but all other categories finished in negative territory, including equity funds, which had net outflows of nearly €21bn, UCITS alternative funds (-€7.9bn), and diversified funds (-€5.5bn). Money market funds posted net outflows of €3.2bn, while open-ended funds on sale on the European market posted net outflows of €22bn in March, and €58.3bn in the first three months of this year.
