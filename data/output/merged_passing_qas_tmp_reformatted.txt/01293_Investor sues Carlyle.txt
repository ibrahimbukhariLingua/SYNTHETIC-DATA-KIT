Investor sues Carlyle


National Industries Group, a prominent Kuwaiti conglomerate, is suing the Carlyle Group in a local court, alleging that the US private equity firm misrepresented the safety of Carlyle Capital Corp, a public debt fund which collapsed in March 2008. NIG invested USD50m in the fund, which was marketed as a safe vehicle that would invest largely in triple A mortgage-backed securities
