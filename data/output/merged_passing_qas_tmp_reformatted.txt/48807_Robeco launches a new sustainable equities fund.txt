p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Netherlands-based asset management firm Robeco, in collaboration with the sustainable investment specialist RobecoSAM, on 19 December unveiled the launch of the Robeco QI Global Sustainable Conservative Equities fund. The new product, oriented to equities, aims to deliver performance with the lowest level of risk possible, while offering a better sustainable investment profile than its benchmark index, the MSCI World All Country, the asset management firm says in a statement. The new fund will be managed by the team responsible for conservative equities at Robeco, based in Rotterdam, which now oversees EUR16.9bn in assets. The team is specialised particularly in investment solutions based on quantitative factors. RobecoSAM participated in the development of the new range and is responsible for Smart ESG ratings, with the objective of reducing the environmental impact of the portfolio by 20% compared with the MSCI World All Country index, and to avoid any investments in businesses with controversial activities. The new fund, domiciled in Luxembourg, will be available to investors in the largest Robeco markets.
