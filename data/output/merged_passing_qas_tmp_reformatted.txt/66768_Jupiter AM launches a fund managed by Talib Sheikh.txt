Jupiter AM launches a fund managed by Talib Sheikh


Jupiter is launching the Jupiter Flexible Income, a fund which will be managed by Talib Sheikh, who joined the asset management firm in June this year as director of multi-asset strategy, after leaving JP Morgan Asset Management. The sub-fund of the Jupiter Global Fund Sicav will aim to achieve a sustained level of regular income from several asset classes worldwide. Initial returns will total between 4% and 6%, with the aim of long-term capital growth (three to five years). The fund, which is starting with assets of EUR55m, will integrate the competence of equity sectoral specialists and credit analysis teams at Jupiter AM to define a strategic allocation of assets. The multi-asset team (composed of Sheikh, Lee Manzi, Rhys Petheram and Joseph Chapman) will manage all macro outlooks and tactical allocation decisions. p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 115%; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; }
