Assogestioni plans to lower ratings criteria for money market funds


The Italian asset management association, Assogestioni, is studying the possibility of lowering the minimal rating required for sovereign debt held by money market funds. The limit would be lowered to investment grade.The Italian association made the announcement in a statement. The decision would prevent managers from being required to divest the funds due to recent and future downgrades of the credit ratings of some governments on the part of ratings agencies.Assogestioni points out that by its rules, money market funds may hold bonds with a rating of at least A2 (Moodyâ€™s) or A (S&P).
