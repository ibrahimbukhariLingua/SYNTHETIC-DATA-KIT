Lyxor plans to launch a pan-Asian UCITS fund


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } Lyxor is planning to launch an Asian UCITS fund, which will be the first of its kind on its platform, in partnership with an asset management firm based in the region, Asia Investor states. The product will replicate the flagship strategy from the asset management firm, according to St√©phane Macresy, head for hedge fund selection for Asia at Lyxor. The French asset management firm is also planning to return China strategies to the hedge fund platform. It is offering 10 hedge fund managers based in Asia on its managed account platform, or for direct investment, out of more than 100 on its list of approved managers. But these do not include any products specialised in China exclusively. This can be expected to change.
