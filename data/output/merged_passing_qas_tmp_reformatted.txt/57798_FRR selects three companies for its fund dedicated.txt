FRR selects three companies for its fund dedicated to French economy


As part of its programme of investment in private assets in the French economy, the Fonds de r√©serve pour les retraites (FRR) on 7 November 2016 launched a request for proposals to select several investment service providers who will each be responsible under a discretionary management mandate (for EUR200m) for creating and managing a dedicated fund for the FRR. At the conclusion of the selection process, the FRR has decided to select bids from Idinvest Partners, Omnes Capital and Truffle Capital. The mandates are awarded for a duration of 12 years, which may be renewed for two periods of one year each.The dedicated funds from the FRR must be invested exclusively in the capital innovation segment, in companies which are headquartered in France. These investments are intended to finance the first stages of development of the business, meaning the early stages of creation and later stage of growth at the business.
