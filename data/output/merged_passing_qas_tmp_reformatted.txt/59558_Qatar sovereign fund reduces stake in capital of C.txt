Qatar sovereign fund reduces stake in capital of Credit Suisse


One of the largest shareholders in Credit Suisse, the Qatar sovereign fund, is reducing its stake in the group and selling its buy options in the form of convertible shares. The sovereign fund now has a stake of 4.94% in capital, and conversion rights in the form of convertibles for 10.97%, compared with 5.01% and 12.96%, respectively, previously. The sovereign fund in early summer participated in another capital increase at Credit Suisse, butJassim Bin Hamad J.J. Al Thani, its representative on the supervisory board of the group, resigned this year. The reduction in capital in convertibles held by the sovereign fund may be surprising to the extent that these shares offer returns of 9% to 9.5%.It is also true that Qatar has been placed under a quarantine by Saudi Arabia, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, Barhain and Egypt, who accuse it of financing terrorism. The ban against Qatar also clearly affects banks in which the sovereign fund is a shareholder, including Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Barclays.
