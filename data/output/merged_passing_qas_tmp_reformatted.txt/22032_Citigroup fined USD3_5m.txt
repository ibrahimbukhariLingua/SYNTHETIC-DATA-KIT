Citigroup fined USD3.5m


The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has fined Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. USD3.5 million for providing inaccurate mortgage performance information, supervisory failures and other violations in connection with subprime residential mortgage-backed securitizations (RMBS).Issuers of RMBS are required to disclose historical performance information for past securitizations that contain mortgage loans similar to those in the RMBS being offered to investors. Historical data on mortgage performance is material to investors in assessing the value of RMBS and in determining whether future returns may be disrupted by mortgage holdersâ€™ failures to make loan payments.
