Big opportunities in private banking


In an interview with L’Agefi Switzerland, Joachim H. Strähle, executive president of Banque Sarasin, says organic growth is a first preference, but does not rule out an acquisition (of a firm with assets under management of at least CFH20bn), if an opportunity presents itself. “We see big opportunities in the next three to five years, especially in Asia and the Middle East. Private banking remains fundamentally a growth industry, with enough potential for all actors in the market. Consolidation is probable, even if it takes a while to fully appear. The recovery of the financial markets is helping to defer this process, and is inciting some actors to wait for a better sale price. In the longer term, the process is inevitable, particularly for banks whose private banking operations are not a core activity, who will need to divest in order to repay debts. Whatever happens, the next twelve months will be interesting,” the CEO of the Sarasin group explains.
