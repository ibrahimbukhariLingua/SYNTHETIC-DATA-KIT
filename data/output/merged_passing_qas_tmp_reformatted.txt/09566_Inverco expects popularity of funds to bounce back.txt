Inverco expects popularity of funds to bounce back


Mariano Rabadán, president of the Inverco association of asset management firms, has stated that the savings rate for Spanish households increased to 20% in 2009 from 11% in 2008, but that the increase profited bank savings, which increased by EUR38bn, despite a fall in returns (1.79% for the two years deposit at the end of December, compared with 5.15% in October 2008), Cinco Días reports. In contrast, securities funds saw net redemptions of EUR11.64bn, though in the past ten years these funds earned average returns of 4.93%. Inverco is predicting an increase of 10.1% in assets this year, to EUR179bn, while the increase for the asset management sector as a whole (including foreign asset management firms and Sicav funds) may total 9.3% compared with their levels at the end of 2009, to EUR246.25bn. Net subscriptions may total EUR12bn, the association hopes. Rabadán also welcomes government proposals to raise the retirement age to 67 from 65, and claims it is the most important and sensible proposal of the past 15 years.
