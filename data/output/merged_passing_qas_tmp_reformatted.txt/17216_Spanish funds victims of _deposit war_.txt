Spanish funds victims of “deposit war”


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } Once again in 2010, investment funds were sacrificed by Spanish banks and savings banks, which dedicated their sales efforts to capturing savings, to the detriment even of the management firms owned by them, in a phenomenon known as the “deposit war.”On Monday, Ahorro Corporación (savings banks) and the Inverco association of Spanish asset management firms both announced that assets last year fell 14.7% to EUR145.2bn, according to the former, and EUR138.64bn, according to the latter. This is relatively coherent with the decline of 15.35% to EUR144.54bn announced by VDOS Stochastics as of 24 December (see Newsmanagers of 3 January).Ahorro Corporación states that since 2007, when assets were at their highest level (EUR250bn), assets under management have fallen nearly 42%, while Inverco estimates that the contraction totals EUR115bn since the end of 2006.
