Richard Pease invests in his own fund


Richard Pease has invested GBP2m in his own New Star European Growth Fund (EUR81.7m in assets), and a further GBP2m in Henderson. This is a show of confidence by the manager in the potential of his fund and in the UK asset management firm he is a part of since its acquisition of New Star. The New Star European Growth fund invests in European companies with a low valuation and potential for growth. Pease said at a presentation in Paris that “given fears of inflation in the long term, it is more necessary than ever to be invested in shares in good companies with pricing power. And I think that now is the time to seize the opportunity to invest, since shares are attractively priced.” To take advantage of attractive valuations, Pease will launch a “Special Situations” fund in September based in the United Kingdom. The fund will have a class of shares in Euros and another in sterling, and perhaps a third class in US dollars. The management will be similar to that of the European Growth fund, but will be less constrained, and will have a midcap bias. Pease, who has already managed a special situations fund at Jupiter, is also planning to invest in the fund.
