ALPS launches four ETFs based on Goldman Sachs indices


Tom Carter, executive vice president of ALPS Holdings, on 20 December announced that ALPS (DST Systems group) is launching four ETFs replicating indices from Goldman Sachs, three of which are based on GS Momentum Builder products, whose objective is to capture exposure to momentum to select asset classes or markets via a risk control mechanism. The ALPS/GS Momentum Builder Growth Markets Equities and U.S. Treasuries Index ETF (acronym on NYSE Arca: GSGO), charges fees of 1.29%, while the ALPS/GS Momentum Builder Multi-Asset Index ETF (GSMA), charges 1.14%, and the ALPS/GS Momentum Builder Asia ex-Japan Equities and U.S. Treasuries Index ETF (GSAX) has a TER of 1.22%. The fourth fund replicates a Goldman Sachs index which reflects a hypothetical portfolio of US equities which are intended to post the highest risk-adjusted returns on the basis of target prices adjusted according to volatility defined by a consensus of sectoral analysts covering equities of the Russell 1000 index. The product, with a TER of 0.55%, is the ALPS/GS Risk-Adjusted Return U.S. Large Cap Index ETF (GSRA).
