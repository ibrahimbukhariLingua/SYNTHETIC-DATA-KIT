Netherlands - Legal victory for British pension funds


The tax authorities of the Netherlands have officially admitted that they should not have withheld tax on dividends paid to tax-exempt organisations, such as pension funds based outside the Netherlands, but inside the European Union, Professional Pensions reports. The verdict, which came in a landmark case filed by the Strathclyde Pension Fund, which will be reimbursed the amounts withheld from it since 2003, will allow about 70 British pension fund clients of KPMG hope for reimbursement of about EUR100m in total. The Hague has admitted that its regulations in force before 2007 contravened EU law.
