Germany - Deka will have to make cutbacks


Although the chairman of the board, Franz Waas, has done much to restore stability at DekaBank since his arrival in early 2006, and he was wise enough to reduce the exposure of portfolios before the crisis began, he reinvested too soon, and worse, these investments went into derivative activities, which have suffered most heavily, the Frankurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. The central management firm for the savings banks is now being required by its shareholders to cut back its portfolio of structured products, which represented EUR44bn in assets as of the end of June 2008. The firm will also have to call off plans to enlarge market activities, and it is not certain that the boardâ€™s term will be extended after the 2008 fiscal term.
