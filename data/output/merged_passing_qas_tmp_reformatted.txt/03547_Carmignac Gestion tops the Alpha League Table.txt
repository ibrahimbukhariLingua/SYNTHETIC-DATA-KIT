Carmignac Gestion tops the Alpha League Table


In an environment marked by the crisis and investorsâ€™ aversion to risk, French managers have performed less well in 2008 than in 2007. This is one of the most clear lessons of the most recent edition of the Alpha League Table 2009 from EDHEC and EuroPerformance, which measures alpha, or the ability of management firms to generate returns in equities management that do not stem from the equities themselves. The average alpha earned by French management firms in 2008 totalled 1.78%, a decrease from the previous year (2.50%) and from 2007 (2.98%). Carmignac Gestion has gained four placed in the rankings in a single year, and finished on top of the rankings in the Alpha League Table 2009 for the French market, as their funds outperformed their universes 50.83% of the time, and earned an average alpha of 3.82%. In second place (+1 place) is State Street Global Advisors (France), with positive alpha for 48.16% of products, and average alpha of 3.36%. Comgest takes third place in the rankings (+3 places): it has increased the frequency of positive alpha for its products, to 41.97%, and shows an average of 2.87%.
