Three former GLG shareholders suffer virtual loss of USD220m


Former GLG shareholders Pierre Lagrange, Emmanuel Roman and Noam Gottesman, former shareholders in GLG Partners, have undergone a virtual loss of USD220m, two years after their firm was acquired by Man Group, the Financial Times reports. From Monday, the three men, who traded in their stakes in GLG for Man shares in October 2010, will be able to sell off one third of their shares if they so desire. Since the merger two years ago, Man shares have fallen from 264 pence per share to 90 pence on Friday. Lagrange and Roman are not planning to sell shares, according to sources familiar with the matter cited by the FT. Gottesman could not be reached for comment.
