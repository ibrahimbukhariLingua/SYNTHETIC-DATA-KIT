ANCV invests EUR300m in SRI


The Agence Nationale pour les Chèques Vacances (ANCV) has invested EUR300m in two dedicated SRI (socially responsible investment) funds, an amount equivalent to one third of its reserves. Two asset managers have been selected for the investment: Groupama Asset Management, for SRI money market management, and BNP Paribas Investment Partners for SRI bond management. Each firm will receive EUR150m. The bfinance agency, which advised the ANCV in the selection of the managers, explains that the public establishment, which manages an employee holiday voucher system, has adopted a strategy based on two key areas in SRI: social and governance issues. “Investments will therefore be oriented to issuers who are deontologically satisfactory (absence of fraud and tax havens, transparency of balance sheets, and good governance,)” bfinance explains.
