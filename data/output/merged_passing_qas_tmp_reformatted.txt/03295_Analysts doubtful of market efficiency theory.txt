Analysts doubtful of market efficiency theory


The Chartered Financial Analyst Institute in the United Kingdom has recently asked its members for the first time if they believe in the theory of market efficiency, the Financial Times reports. The result is that two thirds of respondents no longer feel that prices integrate all the available information. More surprisingly, 77% of respondents disagree with the assertion that investors taken as a whole behave rationally.
