Franklin Templeton cuts back UK fund range


Fundweb reports that Franklin Templeton has decided to absorb the Templeton UK Equity Fund into the Franklin UK Managersâ€™ Focus Fund, and to absorb the Franklin US Equity Fund into the Franklin US Opportunities Fund. Meanwhile, the Franklin Biotechnology and Franklin Global Reit funds will be liquidated at the end of May. These moves will increase the efficiency of the range, which will concentrate on OEIC sub-funds, says Ian Wilkins, country head for Franklin Templeton in the UK.
