Pictet CEO critical of fund distributors


p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } In an interview with Financial Times Fund Management, Laurent Ramsey, CEO of Pictet Funds, expresses regret that in Europe, commissions are shared increasingly to the advantage of fund distributors, and thus to the detriment of management firms. Efama, the European fund and asset management association, of which Ramsey is a member, is currently conducting a study of the level of commissions paid in Europe and how they are shared out. Ramsey hopes that the report, which will be published by summer, will increase transparency about fees, and bring them into line with levels in the United States.
