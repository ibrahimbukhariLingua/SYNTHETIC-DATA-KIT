Class-action lawsuit against Porsche


Several hedge funds, including Elliot Associates, Glenhill Capital and Perry Partners, have filed a lawsuit in a US court against Porsche Automobile Holding SE, as well as its former chairman and its CFO, the BÃ¶rsen-Zeitung reports. They accuse the auto maker of intentionally misleading the markets by dissimulating about the real size of its stake in Volkswagen, which led to erratic fluctuations in share prices in October 2008 that cost the funds over USD1bn.
