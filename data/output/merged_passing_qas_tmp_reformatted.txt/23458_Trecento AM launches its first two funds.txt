Trecento AM launches its first two funds


Trecento Asset Management is launching the first two funds in its range. The new asset management firm, which opened its doors in December 2011 (see Newsmanagers of 15 December 2011), has received licenses for two UCITS IV-compliant FCP funds. The first of these, Trecento Market Neutral, is an equity arbitrage fund which aims to benefit in the short term from differences in intra-sectoral valuation, while neutralising its exposure to equity markets. Trecento Market Neutral is managed by Julien Bourret, former manager of the pair-trade allocation from the long/short fund from Sycomore Asset Management. The second fund, Trecento European Equities, is a European equity fund whose portfolio is composed of high-quality businesses which have valuations that the management team considers particularly attractive. It aims to offer performance higher than the Stoxx Europe 600 index, via an active strategy of buying and selling on European equity markets. Franck le Franc, previously an equity manager at Neuflize, then Somangest, is manager of the fund.
