Luxembourg lawyer up for position as head of EFAMA


Claude Kremer, chairman of the Luxembourg investment fund industry (ALFI), and a partner at the law firm Arendt & Medernach, is the only candidate to succeed Jean-Baptiste de Franssu as the next president of EFAMA, the European fund and asset management association, Financial Times Fund Management reports, relaying an article published in Ignites. Kremer is thus certain to be elected in June. Two vice-presidents will also be appointed for the first time. Massimo Tosato, vice-president of Schroders, and Christian Dargnat, CIO at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, are the sole candidates for these positions, and will thus be very likely elected.
