We understand that Sébastien Barbe is leaving Rothschild & Cie Gestion, «legendary» head of the fixed income opération, who had been appointed partner ot the company a few days ago. He is reported to join a third party company with a wider task.His position will be modified so that the «Europe convertibles» he had in charge on top of fixed income will be integrated to the equity and balanced department under Didier Bouvignies and Philippe Chaumel, respectively CIO and co-head of Asset Allocation. For the convertibles opération, Krustell Agaesse, co-manager for the last four years, would take over for the management, and one person is about to be hired to reinforce the team. As far as fixed income is concerned, the team with Christophe Peyraud, Emmanuel Petit and Julien Boy are supposed to concentrate ont Euro govies, Euro credit and insurance mandates. In the meantime, until a replacement is hired for a new head of the fixed income and money market teams, these teams will report directly to Didier Bouvignies.
