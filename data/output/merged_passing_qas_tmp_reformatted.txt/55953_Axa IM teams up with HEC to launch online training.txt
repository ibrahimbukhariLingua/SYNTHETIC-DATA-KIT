The online training session, available to all, will be available from April 2016 via the training website Coursera. “The MOOC aims to make topics related to investment and financial markets more intelligible and accessible to the general public via a digital solution,” the two partners say in a statement. “The field of finance, increasingly complex and constantly evolving due to regulatory and demographic changes, has implications for everyone, independently of their age, gender or profession.”
