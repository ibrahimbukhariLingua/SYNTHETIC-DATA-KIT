IOSCO publishes principles for CIS valuation


The Board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions published on Friday, May 3 the final report on Principles for the Valuation of Collective Investment Schemes, containing a list of Principles intended to serve as a basis for both industry practitioners and regulators to assess the quality of regulation and industry practices regarding the valuation of collective investment schemes (CIS).The final report revises IOSCO’s Principles for CIS Valuation, originally developed in 1999, to take into account subsequent regulatory, industry and market developments. Many complex and hard-to-value assets are now eligible for CIS portfolios, including some that did not exist a decade ago. The value of such assets cannot be determined by using quoted prices (so- called mark-to-market), but instead CIS may rely on internal techniques which imply management’s judgment (so-called mark-to-model). The difficulty and subjectivity needed for certain valuations increases regulatory risks and calls for a set of principles to guide the identification of policies and procedures designed to ascertain the proper valuation of CIS assets.
