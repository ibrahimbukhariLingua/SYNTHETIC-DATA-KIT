Severe fall in market value of CalPERS assets in 2008-9


The California Public Employeesâ€™ Retirement System (CalPERS) on 21 July announced that the market value of its assets as of 30 June 2009, the end of its 2008-2009 fiscal year, was down 23.4% on one year, at a total of USD180.9bn, compared with USD237.1bn one year previously. CalPERS says in a statement that in March 2009, the market value of assets had fallen to USD160bn.According to CalPERS, this fall of more than 23% represents the heaviest decline ever recorded for a single year, but over 20 years, the performance of the fund remains positive, at 7.75%.CalPERS states that returns rose 0.6% for fixed income and 1.4% for cash, but fell by 35.8% for real estate (as of 31 March 2009), 31.4% for private equity (also as of 31 March), 28.5% for equities on one year, and 20.9% for inflation-linked assets (commodities, infrastructure, and linkers).CalPERS states that these results are no surprise, given the collapse of the markets and the financial crisis, but says it is taking measures to adapt to the new economic environment. The fund has already undertaken a revision of its asset allocation strategy, and is reviewing its relations with hedge fund and private equity partners, modernising its risk management, and pushing for better protection of investors by federal authorities.
