Aberdeen AM to open an office in Madrid


The asset management firm Aberdeen Asset Management will soon open an office in Madrid. The opening of the new office, which has been delayed several times, is expected to finally take place next month. The Spanish market, which has hitherto been served from London, represents only EUR300m to EUR400m in assets under management, but a presence on the market meets growing demand from local investors.
