On the one hand, the fact that commissions are expressed as percentages rather than cash amounts confuses many consumers. On the other hand, several businesses which say they are independent have a tendency in reality to select only a restricted number of products and providers. Lastly, many clients complain that they do not receive clear explanations of the service they receive for the commissions they pay.The report is the first of three which are planned throughout the year to judge the progress that advising firms are making in investing to comply with the requirements of RDR regulations. In parallel to the survey, the FCA is publishing the findings of a study it commissions which examines the extent to which documents and material provided by advising firms genuinely help consumers to understand the fees they will pay and the service they can expect. The study points to the need to provide clear and concise information if it is desired that consumers be in a position to understand and compare services and prices.The FCA is also sending a fact sheet to more than 6,000 financial advising firms to help them determine whether the shared preoccupations of the sector that have been identified apply to them as well.
