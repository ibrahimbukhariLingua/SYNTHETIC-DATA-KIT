Funds from Anima disappoint


At a time when the Italian asset management firm Anima is preparing to hold its IPO, Bluerating observes that most funds on sale from the structure show disappointing returns. For example, since the beginning of 2013, Anima Fix Emergenti has lost nearly 8%, and Anima Obbligazionario Emergente has lost 7.3%. From November 2012 to the present, all Anima funds invested in emerging markets have lost money for their clients. Over three years, the results are the same.
