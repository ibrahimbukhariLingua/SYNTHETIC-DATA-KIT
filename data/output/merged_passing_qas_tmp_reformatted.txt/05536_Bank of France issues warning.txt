p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }a:link { } The Bank of France is issued a public warning, after being alerted on Friday, 17 December 2010, that there has been a phishing attack using the email address webmestre@banquefrance.fr. A fake letter claiming to be from the Bank of France at this address asks recipients to connect to a web page bearing “Verified by Visa” and “Mastercard SecureCode” logos. On this page, surfers are asked to enter personal information, including bank card number, expiration date, and security code. The Bank of France says that it did not send the message, and warns recipients not to divulge any personal information on the internet.
