Pictet recuperates more than CHF700m from former US clients of UBS


The decision by UBS in July 2008 to no longer offer cross-border operations with US clients has had a silver lining for at least one happy company. The Swiss private bank Pictet has seen inflows since mid-2008 of about CHF735m from former US clients of UBS, according to the website finews, which cites an article in SonntagsBlick. Only the Julius Baer bank has taken on more assets from US clients, finews reports.Funds which used to be at Pictet have been integrated into the portfolios of Pictet North American Advisors (PNAA), says finews. Assets under management at PNAA total about CHF3.3bn.
