Twelve Capital issues a USD28bn cat bond


p { margin-bottom: 0.1in; line-height: 120%; } The independent asset management firm Twelve Capital, based in Zurich, on Monday, 2 June announced that it has issued a new private catastrophe bond (“catbond”), entitled “Dodeka IV.” Dodeka IV is a USD 28m zero-coupon Cat Bond that expires on December 15, 2014, and covers wind risk in the United States, a statement says. It consists of two tranches. The first covers losses due to wind events in Florida, the second covers losses due to wind events in the US federal states around Gulf of Mexico. The second tranche offers a particularly interesting risk within the Cat Bond universe, as there are few bonds focusing on the Gulf of Mexico States.
