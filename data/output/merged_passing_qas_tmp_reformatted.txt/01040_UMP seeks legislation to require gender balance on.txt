UMP seeks legislation to require gender balance on executive boards


Les Echos reports that French legislators will on 19 January debate a proposed law which would require quotas of women on the executive boards of businesses. The bill, sponsored by the president of the UMP alliance of political parties, Jean-François Copé, and Marie-Jo Zimmermann, a UMP member from Moselle, would include sanctions, and would require boards to comply within five years. Barely 13% of the UMP’s members are women, though there are financial penalties for this under legislation passed on 6 June 2000 which requires parity of men and women in legislative elections.
