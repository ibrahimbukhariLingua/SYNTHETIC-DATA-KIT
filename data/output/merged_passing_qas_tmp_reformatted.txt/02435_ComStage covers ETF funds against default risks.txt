ComStage covers ETF funds against default risks


Commerzbank announced on Thursday that its synthetic replication ComStage ETFs will now (from 1 September) carry excess coverage of 130% against risks of default, using government bonds and other assets as collateral to protect themselves against the possible default of a partner on a swap. In compliance with the UCITS III directive, the proportion of swaps in the funds may not exceed 10% of the net asset value of the funds, though in practice they represent a far lower percentage.
