Barings launches a fund of Chinese “A” shares


Agnes Deng, head of China equities, who is based in Hong Kong, will manage the new Baring A-Share Fund Plc, which was launched on Tuesday, and which already has USD200m in assets pledged by institutional investors, while the full capacity of the fund is USD285m. Deng is already manager of the Baring Hong Kong China Fund (USD4.74bn as of 26 February). The Irish-registered fund, with 40-70 positions, will allow subscribers, largely institutional investors, access to companies which are based in the People’s Republic of China or operate there. At least 70% of assets will be invested in A-class shares traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets. Minimal subscription for the fund is set at USD25,000. Baring Asset Management has a Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) quota of USD200m.
