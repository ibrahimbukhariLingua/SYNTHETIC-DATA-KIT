European equities gain popularity at BlackRock


Europe is not out of the woods yet, but the worst appears to be over and the process of resolving the crisis is underway. In this context, “valuations of European equities are expected to be more attractive than US valuations,” says Charles Prideaux, managing director and head of institutional activities for EMEA at BlackRock, on a visit to Paris yesterday. Another factor in favour of European equities is the relatively weak returns on «safe» government bonds. Hence the attraction of seeking dividend-paying equities among the major publicly-traded large caps. Growth will remain soft in Europe, but in the US, the picture is not much more encouraging. The real estate sector is beginning to recover, but the job market remains anemic, while elsewhere in the world, emerging markets are expected to be an engine, as conjuncture accelerates in China. This environment therefore remains highly difficult and volatile. “The only thing which is certain is that we will have to live through some uncertainty,” Prideaux says. “But appetite for risk is still there. And staying on the sidelines isn’t necessarily the best strategy. We are taking risks for our clients, but calculated risks,” Prideaux continues, citing the FIGA (fixed income global alpha) hedge fund strategy, which aims to profit from anomalies in the bond markets. In search of returns as well as diversification, alternative management is now one of the most popular strategies for institutionals in all segments, not only hedge funds, but also private equity, real estate, and last but not least, infrastructure. BlackRock is also working on solutions to interest instittutional investors at the highest point of the current environment, including defined contribution programmes, liability-driven investment (LDI) management and income strategies.
