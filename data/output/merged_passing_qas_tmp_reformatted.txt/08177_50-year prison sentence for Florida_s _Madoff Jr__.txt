50-year prison sentence for Florida’s “Madoff Jr.”


Les Echos reports that the American Scott Rothstein was yesterday sentenced by a Florida judge to 50 years in prison for setting up a Ponzi scheme, a fraud similar to the one orchestrated by Bernard Madoff. Rothstein’s fraud measured USD1.2bn, compared with USD65bn for Madoff. The investor, who had connections in local political circles, recruited his “clients” from among rich Florida investors, promising them high returns on their investments.
