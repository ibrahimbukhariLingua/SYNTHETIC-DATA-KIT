Healthcare market is attractive for investors


The healthcare sector will attract a growing share of transactions, as it is considered a refuge for investors, both short and long term, according to a study by PwC of merger and acquisition activiti4es in the healthcare sector (“Global Healthcare Deals Quarterly”). The market has shown a solid balance sheet and support from investment funds, despite a grim economic environment in 2012.PwC has identified three key factors in the growth of trading volumes. First of all, a general resilience of operations, favourable demographic indicators, and a strong infrastructure component are all reassuring indicators for investors facing a high-risk macroeconomic environment.In the Health/Pharma sector, difficulties encountered in the search for and development of new products have led to a reorientation of capital, reducing investments in medication-type products or medical equipment, in favour of investments in new medical technologies and medical services.Lastly, the development of innovative models for the diffusion of medical services make it possible to provide a higher quality, more competitive and more effective range of healthcare services in countries such as Australia, India and the Middle East, which will be likely to attract new capital.
