In July, the European parliament rejected a proposal to limit bonuses to 100% of fixed salaries and to forbid performance commissions for UCITS funds by a vote of 348 to 341. Due to the tightness of the vote, many thought that it might be overturned by the parliament formed after the elections in May 2014. Lithuania has formed a working group for 21 October, which suggests that the planned directive may be completed by spring, meaning that the new parliament will not have a chance to review it.
