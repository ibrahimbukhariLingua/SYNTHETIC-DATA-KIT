European Parliament strengthens shareholder rights at businesses


The European Parliament on 14 March in a plenary session passed new laws to stimulate large European corporations to concentrate more on their long-term performance, by encouraging engagement on the part of their shareholders. Shareholders will also have input into management pay scales, and businesses will be able to more easily identify their shareholders.These terms, reached informally between negotiators for Parliament and the Council in December 2016, will allow shareholders some input about pay scales for corporate directors, which allows them to better tie these policies to the performance and long-term interests of the firm. Businesses will also be more easily able to identify their shareholders and enter dialogue with them. Shareholders will also be more easily able to exercise their rights, including the right to participate and vote at general shareholders’ meetings.These rules will introduce new obligations for transparency for institutional investors such as pension funds and life insurers, and asset management firms, which are often large shareholders in companies listed on stock markets in the EU. Institutional investors and asset management firms will be required to publicly disclose a policy which describes how they integrate investor engagement into their investment strategies, or explains why they do not choose to do so.Additionally, voting advisers, who do research and formulate recommendations for their clients as to how to vote at general shareholders’ meetings, will be required to release key information, such as their main sources of information and methods applied in the advice they give.This draft legislation has yet to be formally approved by the EU Council of Ministers. Member states will have a period of 24 months from the entry into force of the directive to apply the new rules.
