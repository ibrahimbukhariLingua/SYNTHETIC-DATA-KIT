G20 not advancing in accounting harmonisation


In an interview with Les Echos, Georges Pauget, CEO of Crédit Agricole SA, claims that “the G20 is very clear on financial regulations, and not at all clear about accounting harmonisation. … I would really have liked to hear it said that ‘fair value’ does not necessarily rely on market valuations to place a value on all assets. The American accounting body (FASB) and its European counterpart (IASB) have been asked to find a convergence, but nothing says that it will happen.”
