FIR backs binding shareholder votes on management pay scales


p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 120%; } The Forum pour l’Investissement Responsable (FIR) on 12 September announced that it will support proposed French government legislation to increase controls on management pay scales and bonuses for directors of companies by shareholders. The French national legislature on 14 June this year passed a bill which will require French businesses to hold a shareholder vote on an annual basis on pay scales and bonuses. The FIR “embraces the objective of better controlling of pay scales and bonuses for directors by general shareholders’ meetings. More generally, it finds that fair sharing of value is an essential factor in social cohesion and the performance of a business. The pay scales of directors must thus be established in a manner which is transparent and consistent with the performance of the business, while insuring collective cohesion in the workplace, of which the director is a member,” the FIR explains in a statement. The 2016 season of corporate shareholders’ meetings was marked by controversies surrounding pay scales for certain directors, illustrating the inadequacy of current governance practices in reining in these pay scales. In addition to the opacity of certain pay structured, this year a new fact was added: negative votes by shareholders at general shareholders’ meetings were rejected by the boards of directors at several large European publicly-traded companies.
