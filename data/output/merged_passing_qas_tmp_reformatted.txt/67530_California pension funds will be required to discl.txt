California pension funds will be required to disclose climate risks


A major development is taking place which may strengthen the pioneering role of California in sustainable development issues. A bill being debated by the California senate, SB 964, would for the first time define the financial risks associated with climate change, and ask the boards of directors at the two largest pension funds in California, USA, to make disclosures about these risks every three years.The first and second largest US pension funds, CalPERS and CalSTRS, will from 2020, and every three years until 2035, release a report on the exposure of their funds to financial risks related to climate change, including risks associated with investment in high carbon-intensity publicly-traded companies, such as utilities, coal, oil, and gas. In addition to disclosures about these risks, the pension funds would also be required to state their situation with respect to the objectives of the Paris accord, and the objectives set by the State of California.
