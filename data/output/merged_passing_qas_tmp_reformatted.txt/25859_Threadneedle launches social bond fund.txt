Threadneedle launches social bond fund


Threadneedle Investments will launch the Threadneedle UK Social Bond Fund in partnership with Big Issue Invest, the social investment arm of The Big Issue. The fund aims to achieve both an investment return and a positive social outcome by investing in fixed income securities of organisations which support socially beneficial activities and economic development. Available to retail and institutional investors from January 2014, it will invest in companies, associations, charities and trusts in social intensity areas including affordable housing and property, community services, employment and training, financial inclusion, health and social care, transport and communications, and utilities and the environment. The fund will launch with GBP10 million of seed investment from Big Society Capital, the world’s first social investment bank and GBP5 million from Threadneedle. The fund’s minimum investment amount is GBP2,000 when accessed via UK platforms. It has an Annual Management Charge (AMC) of 0.30% for both retail and institutional investors, and there is no performance fee. The AMC will be split between Threadneedle and Big Issue Invest, further supporting the work of Big Issue Invest and its parent The Big Issue in financing business solutions to social problems and tackling homelessness. Threadneedle will contribute a portion of its fee to the Threadneedle Foundation, a dedicated entity through which the company provides support for charitable activities.Managed by Simon Bond, credit fund manager at Threadneedle, the fund targets an annual gross return in line with that of a UK corporate bond index such as the Merrill Lynch £ Non Gilt Index, which is currently generating a yield of circa 4% per annum.
