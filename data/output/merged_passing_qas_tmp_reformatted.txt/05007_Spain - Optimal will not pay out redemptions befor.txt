Spain - Optimal will not pay out redemptions before June


Optimal, the fund of hedge fund management firm of the Santander group, announced on Monday that it will not be able to deliver redemptions immediately to subscribers to seven products which the firm has decided to liquidate due to an avalanche of redemption demands, Cinco Días reports. For five of these funds (Optimal European Opportunities, Optimal US Opportunities, Optimal Asian Opportunities, Optimal Global Opportunities, and Optimal Global Trading), the firm plans to reimburse 65% to 80% of investors’ money in June, while the rest will depend on how sales of assets go. For the Arbitrage and Multistrategy funds, the length of the delay has not been specified, but a first round of payments may come in May or June.
