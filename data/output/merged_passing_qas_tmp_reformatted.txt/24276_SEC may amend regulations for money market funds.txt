SEC may amend regulations for money market funds


If at least three of the five SEC commissioners support the proposal, which does not yet appear to be the case, the US regulator may propose measures to stabilise money market funds, the Wall Street Journal reports. The objective would be to reduce losses to subscriptors to a minimum if another wave of panic strikes the markets.The proposals would affect fund managers on the one hand, who would be required to increase their reserve levels, and investors on the other, as those who want to withdraw all of their investment would receive only 95% of their investment immediately, and the remaining 5% would be repaid only 30 days later.
