FCA Institute calls for greater fee transparency


A new study of the consequences of a prohibition on commissions and kickbacks received by financial advisers who sell investment products in the major international financial markets highlights the need for greater transparency for investors. The study, “Restricting Sales Inducements: Perspectives on the Availability and Quality of Financial Advice for Individual Investors,” covers efforts by international regulators and legislators to improve the quality of financial advising for investors. It also deals with the solutions proposed or implemented by regulators to palliate the problem of abusive sales and to explore future scenarios of business models for the industry. It finds that in the opinion of 70% of those surveyed, the poorly adapted character of distributor remuneration structures biased in favour of sales volumes or specific products, represent the main case of abusive sales. The three most popular solutions to combat abusive sales which do not involve a prohibition on commissions and kickbacks are the following: 1. Introduce precise standards for the presentation of fees to investors 2. Revise commission structures to remove those which are related to volume sales (progressive commissions) 3. Set uniform commission rates (a percentage of management fees) for all products in a single category
