Derivatives: Professionals warn against over-regulation


Representatives of the three largest professional associations, ISNA, SIFMA, and LIBA, on 3 September issued a warning to the European Commission over risks related to an overly sudden tightening of regulations. While welcoming the Commission’s interest in the derivatives market and citing the need for improved regualtory frameworks in this area, the three associations also point out that it could be counter-productive to seek to go too far, too fast in this area.“The real economy is facing a variety of risks, whose treatment will depend on publicly-traded derivatives markets. As the risks themselves are not standardized, custom financial instruments remain important,” says the executive director of ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association). As a result, international cooperation is essential, and “we encourage the Commission to recognize that time is needed to set up robust market infrastructure and that solutions put in place too hastily, whether they be voluntary or imposed, may be counter-productive.”
